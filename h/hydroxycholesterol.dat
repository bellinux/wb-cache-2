40|$|A robust on-line {{automatic}} filtration and filter-flush {{solid phase}} extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (AFFL-SPE-LC- MS/MS) method for determination of 25 <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> (25 HC), 24 S <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> (24 SHC) and 22 S <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> (22 SHC) in cell samples has been developed. Only one sample transfer (from sample tube to LC vial) {{was needed for}} the entire process of cell lysis, derivatization and determination of the analytes. In general, cell lysate samples (200 - 400 µL) were mixed with internal standard and evaporated into dryness. The samples were resolved in 2 -propanol and phosphate buffer (pH 7) followed by an oxidation with cholesterol oxidase. Subsequently, methanol and acetic acid {{were added to the}} samples and the samples were derivatized with Girard T reagent. Aliquots of 100 µL were injected directly on to the AFFL-SPE-LC-MS/MS system. The method was validated and showed good linearity (R 2 > 0. 99 in the concentration range 0. 3 - 33 nM). The limit of detection was 0. 06 nM (2. 5 pg injected on column) and the limit of quantification was found to be 0. 3 nM. Repeatability was satisfying at three concentration levels, low (0. 3 nM), medium (2. 1 nM) and high (33 nM), where the relative standard deviation (RSD) between replicates (n= 6) were 15 - 19 %, 5 - 13 % and 5 - 6 %, respectively. RSD between days (n= 5) were 6 - 16 %, 9 - 12 % and 5 - 9 %, respectively. The method was applied for analysis of different cell lines (NIH 3 T 3, SHh-L 2, SUFU-/-, HEK 293, HCT 15 and HCT 116). The between cell flask concentration variation was low (RSD= 5 - 35 %, except for 24 SHC in Shh-LII (RSD= 65 %)) implying method robustness.

This has been carried out by studying the metabolism of exogenous (22 R) - 22 - and 25 -hydroxycholesterol to testosterone. It was found that both hydroxycholesterols increased testosterone production to higher levels than achieved by lutropin alone. Addition of luliberin agonist but not lutropin was found to increase further the metabolism of the <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> to testosterone; this occurred in the presence of saturating and subsaturating levels of the hydroxycholesterols. This effect of luliberin agonist was potentiated in the presence of lutropin. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, inhibited the luliberin agonist-induced stimulation of the <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> metabolism. At low calcium levels (1. 1 microM), testosterone production was increased by addition of (22 R) - 22 -hydroxycholesterol but the luliberin agonist effect was negated. The calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine inhibited (22 R) - 22 -hydroxycholesterol-stimulated steroidogenesis and negated the luliberin agonist effect.

40|$|Abstract Background Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGE) alter {{lipid metabolism}} {{and reduce the}} macrophage expression of ABCA- 1 and ABCG- 1 which impairs the reverse cholesterol transport, a system that drives cholesterol from arterial wall macrophages to the liver, allowing its excretion into the bile and feces. Oxysterols favors lipid homeostasis in macrophages and drive the reverse cholesterol transport, although the accumulation of 7 -ketocholesterol, 7 alpha- <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> and 7 beta- <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> is related to atherogenesis and cell death. We evaluated the effect of glycolaldehyde treatment (GAD; oxoaldehyde that induces a fast formation of intracellular AGE) in macrophages overloaded with oxidized LDL and incubated with HDL alone or HDL plus LXR agonist (T 0901317) in: 1) the intracellular content of oxysterols and total sterols and 2) the contents of ABCA- 1 and ABCG- 1. Methods Total cholesterol and oxysterol subspecies were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and HDL receptors content by immunoblot. Results In control macrophages (C), incubation with HDL or HDL + T 0901317 reduced the intracellular content of total sterols (total cholesterol + oxysterols), cholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol, which was not observed in GAD macrophages. In all experimental conditions no changes {{were found in the}} intracellular content of other oxysterol subspecies comparing C and GAD macrophages. GAD macrophages presented a 45 % reduction in ABCA- 1 protein level as compared to C cells, even after the addition of HDL or HDL + T 0901317. The content of ABCG- 1 was 36. 6 % reduced in GAD macrophages in the presence of HDL as compared to C macrophages. Conclusion In macrophages overloaded with oxidized LDL, glycolaldehyde treatment reduces the HDL-mediated cholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol efflux which is ascribed to the reduction in ABCA- 1 and ABCG- 1 protein level. This may contribute to atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} of cholesterol for myoblast fusion {{has been linked}} to the primary step in the fusion process, calcium-dependent aggregation (recognition). Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with 25 - <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> or compactin in the absence of exogenous lipid dramatically inhibits calcium-mediated aggregation and concomitant fusion within several hours. Restimulating cholesterol synthesis or supplying exogenous cholesterol rapidly restores aggregation activity. Over this time period, however, the sterol:phospholipid ratio is unaltered, suggesting a local rather than a general membrane cholesterol requirement for the expression of aggregation activity. The aggregation response to a change in sterol availability occurs on a shorter time scale than that required to inhibit the synthesis of the protein(s) with aggregation activity; thus, the cholesterol-requiring step is posttranslational. We suggest that the assembly or maintenance of the aggregation activity depends on a continued local supply of cholesterol...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The current studies {{indicate}} that Leydig cells from old (24 - 27 -Mo) rats secreted significantly less cholesterol in response to stimulators, hCG, forskolin, or Bt 2 cAMP as compared to cells from young mature (5 -Mo) animals. This defi-ciency was reversed by incubation of cells with free diffusible <b>hydroxycholesterols,</b> indicating that age-related decline in testosterone secretion primarily results from the reduced availability of substrate cholesterol. Aging also significantly di-minished the Leydig cell mRNA levels of StAR/StarD 1, StarD 2 and StarD 4 both under basal conditions in response to hCG stimulation. Likewise, aging decreased the mRNA levels of PBR/TSPO. These changes correlated well with the re-duced accumulation of cholesterol in Leydig cell mitochondria from old animals. Our results suggest that aging caused impaired expression of key cholesterol transport proteins, StAR/StarD 1, StarD 4 and PBR/TSPO that resulted in inefficient delivery of cholesterol to and within the mitochondria, and subsequently reduced conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and decreased testosterone production...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} some <b>hydroxycholesterols</b> in human serum samples is described. The procedure {{is based on}} hydrolysis and extraction of these compounds in serum samples, followed by removal of especially cholesterol (making use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography) and derivatization of the purified compounds to their trimethylsilyl ethers and subsequent gas chromatography using flame ionization detection. Serum levels of 7 α-hydroxycholesterol, 7 β-hydroxycholesterol and 26 -hydroxycholesterol were determined in several groups of patients: (a) normals, (b) untreated patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatoais, (c) patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis and treated with either chenodeoxycholic acid or cholic acid in an effective dose, (d) patients suffering from cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome, (e) patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia and treated with cholestyramine for prolonged periods and (f) one patient presumed to be suffering from an inborn error of metabolism in bile acid synthesis. It can be concluded that the 7 α-hydyroxycholesterol concentration in serum is a good parameter for establishing disorders involving the metabolic conversion of 7 α-hydroxycholesterol towards bile acids. In addition, 26 -hydroxycholesterol levels in patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are beyond detectable limits, even during treatment with bile acids in an effective dose, whereas in all other conditions this compound is substantially present. © 1987.

When cells were incubated for 24 h with 0. 28 nmol of 27 -hydroxycholesterol in 10 ml of medium, the rates of conversion into 7 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites were 0. 21, 0. 12 and 0. 02 nmol/ 24 h per 10 (6) cells in the media of astrocytes, Schwann cells and neurons respectively. The corresponding values for 25 -hydroxycholesterol were 0. 26, 0. 16 and 0. 04. A minor fraction of 27 -hydroxycholesterol and its 7 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites was oxidized to 3 beta-hydroxy- 5 -cholestenoic acid. 3 beta, 7 alpha-dihydroxy- 5 -cholestenoic acid and 7 alpha-hydroxy- 3 -oxo- 4 -cholestenoic acid.

Glial cells are targets of oxysterols: they inhibit astrocyte proliferation after brain injury, and we have previously shown that 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 OH) provokes oligodendrocyte apoptosis and stimulates the expression of sPLA 2 type IIA (sPLA 2 -IIA), which has a protective effect. Methodology/Principal Findings: As glucocorticoids are well-known for their anti-inflammatory effects, our aim was to understand their direct effects on oxysterol-induced responses in oligodendrocytes (sPLA 2 -IIA stimulation and apoptosis). We demonstrate that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) abolishes the stimulation of sPLA 2 -IIA by 25 <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> (25 -OH). This inhibition is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which decreases the expression of the oxysterol receptor Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and interferes with oxysterol signaling by recruiting a common limiting coactivator PGC 1 a. Consistent with the finding that sPLA 2 -IIA can partially protect oligodendrocytes against oxysteroltriggered apoptosis, we demonstrate here that the inhibition of sPLA 2 -IIA by Dex accelerates the apoptotic phenomenon, leading to a shift towards necrosis.

Compared to the wild type, the four types of Arabidopsis transformant showed varying degrees of phenotypic alteration, the strongest one being in CH 25 lines, which were dark-green dwarfs resembling brassinosteroid-related mutants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of extracts from wild-type Arabidopsis plants revealed trace levels of α and β forms of 7 -hydroxycholesterol, 7 -hydroxycampesterol, and 7 -hydroxysitosterol.

This natural refractory state of the placenta can be overcome in in vitro incubations of fetal cotyledon cells by agents that increase intracellular calcium (3 -isobutylmethylxanthine [MIX], calcium ionophore (A 23187)), addition of substrate (pregnenolone, <b>hydroxycholesterol),</b> and stimulators of protein kinase C (PKC) such as phorbol ester (TPA). We there-fore tested, in cultures of cotyledonary cells, two compounds that have been reported to inhibit protein kinases: 1) staurosporine (STA), an inhibitor of PKC, cAMP-dependent kinase, tyrosine kinase (TK), and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor TK, and 2) genistein, an inhibitor of TK It was found that STA stimulated steroidogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in both the absence and presence of added calcium. STA (10 - 9 M) stimulated at least a twofold increase in P 4 {{production by}} cultured fetal cotyledon cells throughout the first half of gestation (50 - 130 days). EGF was also found to cause a twofold stimulation of P 4 production, and the effect was additive to that of STA. Both basal and EGF- or STA-stimulated production were inhibited by genistein. In contrast, two inhibitors of PKC and PKA (H- 7, H- 8) had no effect on P 4 production. We conclude that STA-induced steroidogenesis in the bovine placenta is not related to its reported ability to inhibit PKC, TK, or EGF receptor T...|$|E
40|$|Background: Insulin {{resistance}} {{is linked to}} dyslipidemia, characterized by a decrease in high density lipo-proteins {{and an increase in}} low density lipoproteins. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are insulin-sensitizing agents used to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, the safety of certain TZD regimens has been questioned because of associated adverse effects on the plasma lipid profile. We examined the effect of a TZD, Ciglitazone, on apolipoprotein synthesis and secretion in human liver HepG 2 cells. Methods and Results: The effect of Ciglitazone treatment on apolipoprotein synthesis was addressed at the level of transcription, translation and secretion. RT-PCR showed that Ciglitazone increased the transcription of apoE and apoAI but reduced the levels of apoCI and apoB mRNA. Western blot analysis showed an increase in apoAI and apoE secreted in the cell culture media, whereas the amounts of apoB 100 and apoCI were reduced. To confirm that Ciglitazone regulates apolipoprotein translation, its effect on de novo protein synthesis was evaluated by metabolic labeling with [35 S]-methionine/cysteine, and a similar pattern of regulation was observed. The change in apolipoprotein levels was not secondary to cholesterol biosynthesis or clearance, since Ciglita-zone did not regulate the transcription of HMGCoA reductase, or the LDL receptor. However, mRNA levels for both PPAR-γ and LXRα were induced, suggesting a role for either or both receptors in modulating the hepatic apolipoprotein profile. The involvement of these nuclear receptor transcription factors was confirmed since direct activation of these receptors by endogenous PPAR-γ ligand, 15 d-prostaglandin J 2, or LXRα ligand, 22 (R) <b>hydroxycholesterol,</b> similarly upregulated apoAI and apoE, but down-regulated apoB 100 protein synthesis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Ciglita-zone treatment results in an atheroprotective lipoprotein profile in liver cells. Thus, while the adipose and muscle tissues may be primary targets in TZD-mediated glucose homeostasis, liver PPAR-γ contributes significantly to the regulation of plasma lipoprotein profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{brain is}} the most {{cholesterol}} rich organ {{in the body and}} contains about one quarter of the body's total cholesterol. How this cholesterol and its metabolism affects the complex brain under normal and pathological conditions {{has been the focus of}} intense research in recent years due to its possible association with the development or progression of neurodegeneration. The primary objective of this thesis was to increase our understanding about cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and its relevance for neurodegenerative disease. Oxysterols are cholesterol oxidation products which are found in the body wherever there is cholesterol. The major oxysterol in brain is 24 S-hydroxycholesterol which is involved in the elimination of excess cholesterol from the brain. Another oxysterol which may also prove important to cholesterol homeostasis in the brain, is 27 -hydroxycholesterol. This oxysterol is formed from cholesterol by way of the cytochrome P 450 enzyme, CYP 27 A 1. To establish a sterol profile of the brain, cholesterol, cholesterol precursors and oxysterols, were measured by isotope dilution mass spectrometry in different areas of the brain of patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. In AD, the levels of the oxysterols 24 Shydroxycholesterol and 27 -hydroxycholesterol in the brain were altered in comparison to controls. 24 S-Hydroxycholesterol was decreased in AD, possibly due to the loss of neurons. A surprising result was the increased levels of 27 -hydroxycholesterol in the AD brain. As CYP 27 A 1 expression was not found to be increased in the brain, this led to the conclusion that there could be a flux of 27 <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> from the circulation into the brain. To investigate a possible uptake of the oxysterol, 27 -hydroxycholesterol, into the brain and its possible metabolism there, blood samples were simultaneously taken from the internal jugular vein and the brachial artery of healthy volunteers. The level of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol was found to be higher in the venous samples, confirming previous studies that there is a net flux of this oxysterol out of the brain. 27 -Hydroxycholesterol had higher concentrations in the arterial samples indicating a net flux of this oxysterol from the circulation into the brain. Preliminary findings also indicated that 7 alphahydroxy 3 -oxo- 4 -cholestenoic acid may be fluxing out of the brain, a steroid which can be formed in the brain from 27 <b>hydroxycholesterol.</b> Cholesterol 24 -hydroxylase or CYP 46 A 1, oxidises cholesterol to 24 S-hydroxycholesterol, which unlike cholesterol, can freely traverse the blood brain barrier. How CYP 46 A I is regulated has not been clarified. A structural and functional characterisation of the promoter of the human CYP 46 A 1 gene was carried out, and using a luciferase reporter assay a broad spectrum of regulatory axes, including cholesterol were investigated to determine if they could regulate the transcription of the gene. Under most conditions there was a failure to demonstrate significant transcriptional regulation. The inability of cholesterol to regulate CYP 46 A 1 was supported in a mouse model with very low cholesterol levels (Dhcr 24 -/- mouse), which had a normal level of Cyp 46 a 1 mRNA in the brain. In summary, cholesterol homeostasis in AD is disturbed as evident by the altered levels of oxysterols in the brain. While there is flux of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol out of the human brain we have demonstrated here that there is also a corresponding flux of 27 -hydroxycholesterol from the circulation into the brain and that it may be metabolised and eliminated again most probably in part as 7 alpha-hydroxy- 3 -oxo- 4 -cholestenoic acid. Finally CYP 46 A 1 is important in cholesterol elimination from the brain but cholesterol itself fails to regulate it...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that consumption of aged whole milk powders containing significant levels of cholesterol oxides may {{be detrimental to}} health has stimulated extensive research. In this study, the effects of feeding regimen and processing technology on the oxidative stability of lipids and cholesterol in whole milk powders were evaluated. Animal feeding regimen {{had a significant effect}} (p < 0. 05) on the levels of total protein, true protein, casein protein and whey protein in standardised milk over the experimental period. Levels of peroxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and cholesterol oxidation products were used as indices of lipid oxidation occurring in whole milk powders. Lipid and cholesterol oxidation increased significantly (p < 0. 01) after 12 months storage, the predominant oxysterols being 7 -ketocholesterol, cholesterol-a-and (3 -epoxides, 25 -hydroxycholesterol and cholestanetriol. A positive correlation was found between the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and cholesterol oxidation products. Significant decreases in lipid oxidation were observed as a result of high pre-heat treatment of milk prior to processing (p < 0. 001), vacuum packing of powders in laminated foil bags prior to storage (p < 0. 05), and storing powders at reduced temperatures (15 ° C) (p < 0. 05). Levels of free sulphydryl groups, which possess antioxidant activity in whole milk powders, increased significantly (p < 0. 05) {{as a result of a}} grass plus concentrate-fed diet and the application of high pre-heat treatment of milk. The toxicity of these oxysterols was evaluted using primary cultures of porcine ovarian granulosa cells. The activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidant defense enzymes, were increased significantly (p < 0. 01) following 24 hour exposure to 2. 5 (iM concentrations of both cholestanetriol and 25 - <b>hydroxycholesterol.</b> Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances remained unchanged under these conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project has been to {{investigate}} the mechanism of hepatitis C virus/lipoprotein complexes of lipo-viro-particles (LVP) derived from transplanted liver macerates of an HCV infected immunodeficient patient (S 6 b) and density-fractionated from an iodixanol gradient. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} serum derived HCV may bind to hepatocytes via the LDL-receptor (LDLr) or the scavenger receptor SR-B 1. The role of these receptors in the uptake of LLVP in HepG 2 cells was investigated by comparing LLVP uptake with that of dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled-low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL) and similarly labeled oxidized LDL (DiI-oxLDL), know to be taken up predominantly via the LDLr and SR-B 1 respectively. DiI-LDL and DiI-oxLDL binding resembled that of LLVP in being significantly increased by insulin and LPDS treatment. DiI-LDL but not DiI-oxLDL binding was also decreased by <b>hydroxycholesterol.</b> These results suggest that all three lipoprotein particles may be taken up via the LDLr which binds predominantly via apolipoprotein B 100. To confirm this, the inhibition of binding studies were conducted. Whilst binding of DiI-LDL was reduced by 98 % by pre-incubation with anti-apoB 100 antibodies, binding of both LLVP and DiI-oxLDL was enhanced. Using confocal microscopy and FACS analysis, we compared the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the binding of the three particles types by washing cells with suramine, previously shown to remove GAG bound-LDL. Like LLVP, DiI-LDL bound at 0 degrees Celsius was washed off with suramine but became resistant at 37 degrees Celsius. In contrast, washing off DiI-oxLDL with suramine at both 0 degrees Celsius and 37 degrees Celsius had no significant effect. The binding patterns of LLVP therefore differ from those of DiI-LDL and DiI-oxLDL. To investigate whether such differences might be due to viral glycoprotein E 2, the effect of polyclonal antibody to E 2 and a monoclonal antibody to the E 2 -hypervariable region (HVR 1) on binding of LLVP to HepG 2 cells was assessed.

Some reports indicated that {{extra virgin olive}} oil has better benefits against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) induced liver injury, but the details are still unclear. It is well established part of liver injury induced by CCl 4 is mediated by lipid peroxidation. In this study we investigated the effect of different dietary fat in rats with and without CCl 4. Oxidized lipid mediators of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and cholesterol liberated through lipoxygenase and cytochrome P 450 enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways were determined. Fischer 344 male rats were fed normal laboratory chow plus 20 % (w/w) corn oil (CO) or {{extra virgin olive oil}} (EVOO) or lard (LD). The animals in each dietary group were hypodermically given CCl 4 (1 : 1 with soybean oil, 0. 1 ml/ 100 g bodyweight) twice a week for 4 weeks and the control with soybean oil only. Oxidized lipid mediators (OLM) namely 5 (S) -, 8 (S) -, 11 (S) -, 12 (S) -, 15 (S) and 20 -HETEs, F 2 -isoprostanes, F 3 -isoprostanes, resolvin D 1, 7 β-hydroxycholesterol, 7 -ketocholesterol, 27 -hydroxycholesterol and the precursor levels were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Liver of rats fed with EVOO had significantly reduced (p< 0. 01) HETE products, F 2 -isoprostanes, 7 β -hydroxycholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol levels compared to control, CO and LD. Treatment of CCl 4 alone substantially elevated (p< 0. 01) liver OLM in particular 5 (S) - and 9 (S) -HETEs, F 2 -isoprostanes, 7 β -hydroxycholesterol and 7 -ketocholesterol compared to the control. However, some of these OLM in rat livers fed with EVOO significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced (HETE products, F 2 -isoprostanes, F 3 [...] <b>hydroxycholesterol)</b> below the control levels.

However, this difference in thermal sensitivity was only detectable with the clonogenic assay and not with the colorimetric assay. Attempts were also made to manipulate cellular cholesterol levels. Firstly, some cells were incubated with phosphatidylcholine liposomes to deplete the plasma membrane of cholesterol: Secondly, another group of cells were treated with 25 <b>hydroxycholesterol,</b> an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to lower cholesterol levels: Finally, a third group of cells were supplemented with cholesterol hemisuccinate, a hydrophilic ester of cholesterol. The first two approaches did not enhance the thermal sensitivity of HTC cells. Supplementation with cholesterol hemisuccinate, which was predicted to partition in to the plasma membrane and reduce membrane fluidity, resulted in increased thermal sensitivity of the cells. Thus, the thermal sensitivity of HTC cells could be enhanced by supplementation with either arachidonate or cholesterol hemisuccinate. A rapid plasma membrane isolation procedure was developed which generated plasma membranes in relatively high yield and purity. The plasma membrane- enriched fraction was also assayed for contaminating intracellular membranes by determining marker enzyme activities associated with these membranes. Using this method, plasma membranes were prepared from HTC cells grown m 60 µM arachidonic acid for 36 hours and from cells grown in normal medium. Analysis of the plasma membrane showed that the arachidonic acid content of the phospholipid fatty acyl groups had been significantly increased in cells {{grown in the}} presence of this fatty acid. There was no change in the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio or cholesterol concentration relative to amount of protein in the plasma membranes from the two cell populations. The measurement of fluidity using DPH fluorescence polarisation revealed that the increase in the arachidomc acid content of the plasma membrane phospholipid acyl groups was associated with enhanced plasma membrane fluidity when compared to control plasma membranes. This increase in plasma membrane fluidity correlated with the enhanced thermal sensitivity of the cells grown in arachidonic acid-containing medium when compared to cells grown in normal medium. Furthermore, the thermal sensitivity of Na(^+), K(^+) –ATPase and alkaline phosphodiesterase I were assessed in plasma membranes derived from arachidonic acid-supplemented and control cells. The enhanced fluidity of plasma membranes derived from arachidonate-supplemented cells also correlated with increased thermosensitivity of alkaline phosphodiesterase I...|$|E
40|$|Many {{oxidized}} lipid {{products have}} been associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, stroke, thalassemia and diabetes mellitus. These products include F 2 -isoprostanes (F 2 -IsoPs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid products (HETEs) and oxysterols or cholesterol oxidation products (COPs). Each product is often measured individually in separate blood samples. Here we present a method capable of measuring F 2 -IsoPs, HETEs, COPs and arachidonate using a single plasma or serum sample. As examples for the application of the method, clinical patient data from stroke, dengue and diabetic mellitus patients are presented. A volume of plasma or serum sample (1 ml) is spiked with heavy isotopic standards and hydrolysed in alkali with organic solvent. It is then purified using anionic exchange solid phase extraction (SPE). After washing the SPE column, hexane and hexane/ethyl acetate portions are collected and combined for COPs measurement. Afterwards, the column is loaded with hexane/ethanol/acetic acid and fractions collected for total F 2 -IsoPs, total HETEs and arachidonate measurement. All compounds in the eluates are measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The robustness of the method was tested by the efficiency of SPE and reproducibility for all compounds measured. The method showed high and reliable efficiency of SPE and reproducibility of oxidized lipid products and were measurable in plasma of healthy volunteers and clinical patients. For example, levels of total F 2 - IsoPs 0. 4590. 26 ng/ml (n 157), total HETEs 34. 1916. 4 ng/ml (n 21) total arachidonate 68. 4924. 5 ug/ml (n 33), and COPs 7 - ketocholesterol 12. 396. 6 ng/ml, 7 b-hydroxycholesterol 6. 393. 5 ng/ ml, 7 a-hydroxycholesterol 15. 197. 1 ng/ml, 24 -hydroxycholesterol 41. 4918. 2 ng/ml and 27 -hydroxycholesterol 29. 1916. 8 ng/ml (n 26) were recorded in healthy volunteers. The method was also applicable in stroke patients where total F 2 -IsoPs 0. 9890. 38 ng/ml (n 21), total HETEs 33. 9922. 1 ng/ml (n 15), total arachidonate 90. 4930. 7 ug/ml (n 21), and COPs 7 -ketocholesterol 27. 9917. 6 ng/ml, 7 b-hydroxycholesterol 31. 5918. 9 ng/ml, 7 a-hydroxycholesterol 5. 591. 6 ng/ml, 24 -hydroxycholesterol 124. 69102. 4 ng/ml and 27 - <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> 37. 6919. 0 ng/ml (n 21) were recorded.

40|$|Cholesterol {{is a vital}} {{compound}} that can undergo cytochrome P 450 (CYP) mediated conversion into steroid hormones, bile acids and oxysterols. CYP enzymes are present in all human tissues and mediate the metabolism of several endogenous and exogenous compounds such as steroids and drugs. Vitamin D status {{has been shown to}} be important for several biological processes such as drug metabolism, modulation of the immune system and bone health. Enzymes in subfamily CYP 3 A (CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5, CYP 3 A 7 and CYP 3 A 43) are present in liver and intestine. They metabolize about 50 % of all prescribed drugs. Genetic factors, age, sex, ethnicity and environmental factors influence the activity and expression of CYP 3 A enzymes. These factors combined cause wide inter-patient variability in CYP 3 A mediated drug response. There are a number of clinical markers to assess the CYP 3 A activity, e. g. plasma midazolam clearance, quinine metabolic ratio and 4 β- hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio. In the present study the plasma levels of 4 β- <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> and the 4 β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio has been evaluated as markers of CYP 3 A activity during enzyme induction by a number of drugs (carbamazepine in Papers I and III, rifampicin in Papers IV-V and efavirenz in Paper V) and by pregnancy (Paper III). The association between CYP 3 A activity and vitamin D status has also been studied (Paper IV-V). In Paper I, carbamazepine treatment in children with epilepsy doubled the plasma levels of 4 β-hydroxycholesterol within two weeks of treatment. The increase was 5 to 10 -fold within eight weeks treatment. In Paper III, pregnancy increased the 4 β- hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio and the plasma levels of cholesterol. Newborn children had the same CYP 3 A activity as adults as indicated by similar 4 β-hydroxycholesterol/ cholesterol ratios. Carbamazepine treatment during pregnancy further increased the CYP 3 A activity in one mother and her child. In Papers IV-V, rifampicin-mediated CYP 3 A induction did not affect the plasma levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D in healthy volunteers or in tuberculosis-HIV co-infected patients. In tuberculosis-HIV co-infected patients there was a significant negative correlation between the plasma levels of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D and the 4 β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio already at initiation of treatment (Paper V). Efavirenz treatment caused a transient decrease in the plasma levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D in HIV-infected patients (Paper V). To summarize, 4 β-hydroxycholesterol and the 4 β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio are useful as markers of CYP 3 A induction. 4 β-Hydroxycholesterol is a non-invasive endogenous clinical marker that is easy to use also in children and vulnerable patient groups.

40|$|Oxysterols are monooxygenated {{derivatives}} {{of cholesterol}} {{with a unique}} ability to pass lipophilic membranes and {{are involved in a}} number of elimination pathways for cholesterol. One of the major oxysterols in the circulation, 24 S-hydroxycholesterol, is formed exclusively in the brain, mainly in neuronal cells. There is a continuous flux of this oxysterol from the brain over the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the circulation, and the levels of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol may thus reflect cholesterol homeostasis in the brain. Another major oxysterol in the circulation, 27 <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> is formed by most cells in the body. The levels of this oxysterol are relatively low in the brain, and the possibility must be considered that part of it may originate from the circulation. In the present thesis the following hypotheses were tested: 1) Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased flux of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol during active periods of the disease and may then have increased plasma levels of this oxysterol; 2) the plasma levels of 24 Shydroxycholesterol in circulation are correlated with the degree of brain atrophy; 3) Patients with neuronal damage and/or demyelination have an increased flux of 24 S-hydroxychole sterol from the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); 4) A defect BBB causes increased flux of 27 -hydroxycholesterol from the circulation into the CSF; 5) Patients with MS may have increased CSF-levels of 7 -oxocholesterol, an oxysterol formed from cholesterol as a consequence of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Isotope dilution - mass spectrometry was used to assay the different oxysterols in CSF and plasma from more than 300 patients with different neurological and geriatric diseases. The amount of the disease burden and the degree of brain atrophy was evaluated in some of the MS patients by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The 95 % confidence interval for 24 S- and 27 -hydroxycholesterol in CSF from a normal population was found to be 0. 4 - 2. 5 µg/L and 0. 2 - 1 µg/L, respectively. In the course of the investigations it was found that: 1) plasma levels of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol are significantly decreased in MS patients with advanced disease, and are likely to reflect the degree of brain atrophy; 2) neuronal damage or demyelination are associated with increased levels of 24 S-hydroxycholesterol in CSF; 3) most of the 27 -hydroxycholesterol in CSF originates from the circulation and a compromised BBB is associated with increased CSF levels of this oxysterol; 4) patients with MS have slightly increased levels of 7 -oxocholesterol in CSF, possibly reflecting an increased lipid peroxidation. The high proportion of the neurological patients with increased CSF levels of {{one or both of the}} two side-chain oxidized oxysterols is consistent with the contention that a normal level of these two oxysterols has a high negative predictive value. In conclusion, the determination of both plasma and CSF oxysterol levels may offer important information for a better understanding of the different processes active in central nervous system diseases...|$|E
40|$|In 1993 it {{was first}} {{suggested}} that the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), described almost 30 years earlier as a malformation syndrome, is caused by defective synthesis of cholesterol. Hypocholesterolaemia and accumulation of the immediate precursor 7 dehydrocholesterol was consistent with deficient activity of the enzyme in the last step of the synthesis, 7 -dehydrocholesterol- 7 -reductase. The discovery raised hopes of developing diagnostic methods, finding strategies for treatment and increasing {{our understanding of the}} pathogenetic mechanisms. The aims of the present study were to identify children with SLOS in Sweden, to initiate and evaluate different treatments and to study the connection between the clinical presentation, biochemical parameters and the basal defect. Seven children with SLOS in Sweden were diagnosed by analysing the plasma sterol composition by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two cases were verified several years after their death by using stored paper blood specimens from the routine neonatal screening programme. A diagnostic method based on the conversion of lathosterol to cholesterol in fibroblasts was developed. The elimination of cholesterol by the oxysterol pathway was studied in SLOS patients. Serum levels of 24 - <b>hydroxycholesterol,</b> almost exclusively originating from brain cholesterol, were decreased. The levels were not as low as expected from the hypocholesterolaemia, however, probably due to slow metabolism. Since no hydroxylated 7 -dehydrocholesterol species could be identified in the circulation of SLOpatients, limited information can be obtained from analyses of oxysterols in this disease. To increase body cholesterol and thereby down-regulate cholesterol synthesis with less accumulation of possible toxic precursors, we treated the patients with dietary cholesterol and bile acids. Surprisingly, patients with extreme hypocholesterolemia initially increased their synthesis of cholesterol, resulting in an increase of the accumulated dehydrocholesterols. Some clinical improvement was seen in all patients, especially as regards photosensitivity. In one case, a progressive course with polyneuropathy, precocious puberty and general deterioration was stopped, at least temporarily, during the dietary supplementation. In an attempt to decrease the dehydrocholesterols more efficiently, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, simvastatin, was added to the dietary treatment in 2 patients. In one of them no obvious clinical benefit was seen and in the other hepatic side effects led to interruption of the medication. A scoring system based on clinical symptoms related to possible pathogenetic mechanisms is proposed as a complement to the commonly used malformation scores. Conclusions: There are most probably cases of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in Sweden which have not yet been identified. The moderate beneficial effects of the present therapy do not appear to justify general neonatal screening. It seems reasonable, however, to consider testing for SLOS when investigating patients with severe feeding difficulties, photosensitivity, unknown liver disease, polyneuropathy and increased susceptibility to infection. Such testing is recommended even if typical stigmata are not obvious, and particularly if there is any degree of developmental delay or behaviour problems. It is also suggested that SLOS has to be excluded in cases with severe foetal or neonatal malformations of unknown aetiology, especially if these are lethal...|$|E
40|$|Tacrolimus, the {{cornerstone}} of most immunosuppressive regimens in solid organ transplantation, {{is characterized by a}} narrow therapeutic window and high pharmacokinetic- and pharmacodynamic variability. Important sources of pharmacokinetic variability include the activity of intestinal and hepatic enzymes and transporters (namely cytochrome P 450 enzymes CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5 as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp)). Therapeutic drug monitoring is part of routine clinical practice but cannot resolve several key issues, such as predicting the magnitude of drug interactions, longitudinal variation in tacrolimus disposition and individual susceptibility to tacrolimus toxicity, particularly its nephrotoxity. This project aims to develop a comprehensive pharmacologic model for tacrolimus in renal recipients that includes genetic polymorphisms relevant to drug metabolism, clinical parameters and functional assessment of in vivo CYP 3 A 4 and P-gp activity using validated drug probes. Additionally, the impact of kidney genotype on renal metabolism of tacrolimus (including metabolite generation) and the resulting nephrotoxicity will be assessed in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model is based on conditionally immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial cells (ciPTEC) with varying CYP 3 A 5 and P-gp genotypes. In vivo assessment will be performed by prospectively evaluating the effects of genetic polymorphisms on production of tacrolimus metabolites in stable renal recipients, and correlating this with the occurrence of tacrolimus nephrotoxicity (assessed on renal allograft protocol biopsies).

40|$|Cholesterol {{oxidation}} products, {{also named}} “oxysterols”, were first mentioned and studied in 1913 by I. Lifschütz while developing the worldwide famous products Eucerin® and Nivea® cream. He described oxysterols of non-enzymatic origin, being principally oxygenated at the sterol ring. In contrary enzymatically derived oxysterols were discovered 50 {{years later and}} appeared to be mainly side chain oxygenated sterols. However, a few oxysterols of both origins exist. Nowadays, it is known that oxysterols tightly regulate cholesterol homeostasis that {{plays a major role in}} human health. This regulation takes place by the mean of four different pathways. The first is the inhibition of the commonly activated sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway and the second is the activation of liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXRβ). The third action of oxysterols is the accelerated degradation of the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. The final pathway triggered by oxysterols is the enhanced cholesterol esterification for cell storage. These regulatory pathways as well as other oxysterol mediated mechanisms that do not regulate cholesterol levels, appeared in the last years to be important for several human physiological processes. For example it was found that 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 -OHC) possesses anti-viral functions. This illustrates that the physiological importance of oxysterols was underestimated and that their implications are still not completely unravelled. Oxysterol analysis, however, is tricky and hampered by several difficulties, such as the large excess of cholesterol, the low endogenous concentrations of oxysterols, the possible autoxidation of cholesterol and oxysterols, the cellular localisation of oxysterols in membranes, the possible modifications of oxysterols like esterifications, reductions, or sulphations and finally their chemical structures and properties making mass spectrometry (MS) analysis difficult and not very specific. In this work, two liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were established for the analysis of oxysterols in human diseases. The first method was developed and implemented for the analysis of oxysterols of non-enzymatic origin in a clinical setting of Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) diagnosis. In addition, a second method was optimised for the analysis of enzymatically-derived oxysterols in the plasma of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), opening a new research domain. In the first part dealing with the analysis of NP-C-specific oxysterols, we were able to precisely, accurately, and robustly measure Cholestane- 3 β, 5 α, 6 β-triol (C-triol) and 7 -Ketocholesterol (7 -KC) following a Steglich esterification. We established reference ranges for NP-C diagnostics, which turned out to be neither age nor gender-dependent and we established the pre-analytical stability of the compounds. We found an important intra-individual variation for both analytes, but could show increased C-triol levels in all Niemann-Pick patients including Niemann Pick type A and B patients. Our results suggest that especially the C-triol is a biomarker for all three Niemann-Pick diseases. In the second part dealing with the oxysterol fingerprint in IBD, we were able to separate in one chromatographic run 24 (S) -hydroxycholesterol (24 (S) -OHC), 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 -OHC), 27 - <b>hydroxycholesterol</b> (27 -OHC), 7 α, 24 (S) -dihydroxycholesterol (7 α, 24 (S) -OHC), 7 α, 25 -dihydroxycholesterol (7 α, 25 -OHC), 7 α, 27 -dihydroxycholesterol (7 α, 27 -OHC), 7 β, 25 -dihydroxycholesterol (7 β, 25 -OHC), and 7 β, 27 - dihydroxycholesterol (7 β, 27 -OHC). The most important finding of our investigation in IBD is that 27 -OHC and eventually 25 -OHC are reduced in plasma of IBD patients compared to healthy volunteers. Both oxysterols are agonists for the LXR receptors, which are implicated in inflammation and thus may possibly participate in inflammatory mechanisms in IBD. The analysis of mono-and dihydroxycholesterols as biomarkers for IBD is a novel approach which shows promise but more IBD samples are required to corroborate the observed differences in oxysterol levels between the different groups, meaning the control group, patients with active Crohn’s disease or in remission, and patients with active Ulcerative colitis or in remission...|$|E
