Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely <b>fast</b> <b>decay</b> time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E

500|$|His {{death and}} funeral {{were treated with}} the same respect afforded to English monarchs before him. On 20 September, his body was moved to Somerset House to lie in state, which was {{opened to the public}} on 18 October. The body had been embalmed, {{shrouded}} and sealed in a lead coffin, which in turn was placed in a wooden decorated coffin, placed next to a life-like effigy. The effigy was decorated with the royal symbols, including: [...] "a rich Suit of uncut Velvet...laced with a rich gold lace, and furr'd with Ermins; upon the Kirtle is the Royal large Robe of the like Purple Velvet laced, and fur'd with Ermins, with rich strings, and tassels of gold...upon his head, the Cap of Regality of Purple Velvet, furr'd with Ermins...upon the Cushion of the Chair stands the Imperial Crown set with stones." [...] The elaborate funeral procession, delayed twice by hesitant preparations, made its way through London on 23 November 1658. The body itself had already been buried at Westminster Abbey two weeks earlier due to its <b>fast</b> <b>decay</b> (by the time of the funeral procession, he had been dead over two months). A catafalque had been erected to receive his coffin which was similar to that of King James I, only [...] "much more stately and expensive".|$|E

60|$|Eames {{passed on}} over the little bridge, {{which seemed to be}} in a state of <b>fast</b> <b>decay,</b> {{unattended}} to by any friendly carpenter, now that the days of its use were so nearly at an end; and on into the garden, lingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to Lily. He looked about as though he expected still to find her there; but {{there was no one to}} be seen in the garden, and no sound to be heard. As every step brought him nearer to her whom he was seeking, he became more and more conscious of the hopelessness of his errand. Him she had never loved, and why should he venture to hope that she would love him now? He would have turned back had he not been aware that his promise to others required that he should persevere. He had said that he would do this thing, and he would be as good as his word. But he hardly ventured to hope that he might be successful. In this frame of mind he slowly made his way up across the lawn.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} absence of {{eigenvalues}} imbedded into the continuous spectrum is {{considered for a}} Schrödinger operator with a periodic potential perturbed by a sufficiently <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> "impurity" potential. Results of this type have previously been known for the one-dimensional case only. Absence of embedded eigenvalues is shown in dimensions two and three if the corresponding Fermi surface is irreducible modulo natural symmetries. It is conjectured that all periodic potentials satisfy this condition. Separable periodic potentials satisfy it, and hence in dimensions two and three Schrödinger operator with a separable periodic potential perturbed by a sufficiently <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> "impurity" potential has no embedded eigenvalues.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the decay properties of positive solutions {{for a family}} of fully nonlinear systems of integral equations containing Wolf potentials and Hardy weights. This class of systems includes examples which are closely related to the Euler-Lagrange equations for several classical inequalities such as the Hardy-Sobolev and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. In particular, a complete characterization of the <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> ground states in terms of their integrability is provided in that bounded and <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> solutions are shown to be equivalent to the integrable solutions. In generating this characterization, additional properties for the integrable solutions, such as their boundedness and optimal integrability, are also established. Furthermore, analogous decay properties for systems of quasilinear equations of the weighted Lane-Emden type are also obtained. Comment: 26 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{rate and}} manner of vacuum decay are {{calculated}} in an explicit flux compactifica-tion, including all thick-wall and gravitational effects. For landscapes built of many units {{of a single}} flux, the <b>fastest</b> <b>decay</b> is usually to discharge just one unit. By con-trast, for landscapes built of a single unit each of many different fluxes, the <b>fastest</b> <b>decay</b> is usually to discharge all the flux at once, which destabilizes the radion and begets a bubble of nothing. By constructing the bubble of nothing as the limit in which ever more flux is removed, we gain new insight into the bubble’s appearance. Finally, we describe a new instanton that mediates simultaneous flux tunneling and decompactification. Our model is the thin-brane approximation to six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Central limit theorems for linear {{statistics}} of lattice random fields (including spin models) are usually proven under suitable mixing conditions or quasi-associativity. Many interesting examples of spin models do not satisfy mixing conditions, {{and on the}} other hand, it does not seem easy to show central limit theorem for local statistics via quasi-associativity. In this work, we prove general central limit theorems for local statistics and quasi-local {{statistics of}} spin models on discrete Cayley graphs with polynomial growth. Further, we contrast these results by proving similar central limit theorems for random fields defined on discrete Cayley graphs but under the stronger assumptions of α-mixing (for local statistics) and exponential α-mixing (for quasi-local statistics). All our central limit theorems assume a suitable variance lower bound like many others in the literature. We illustrate our general central limit theorem with specific examples of lattice spin models and statistics arising in computational topology, statistical physics and random networks. Examples of clustering spin models include quasi-associated spin models with <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> covariances like the off-critical Ising model, level sets of Gaussian random fields with <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> covariances like the massive Gaussian free field and determinantal point processes with <b>fast</b> <b>decaying</b> kernels. Examples of local statistics include intrinsic volumes, face counts, component counts of random cubical complexes while quasi-local statistics include nearest neighbour distances in spin models and Betti numbers of random cubical complexes...|$|R
