Kanazawa et al. demonstrated synchrony detection with MOS <b>depressing</b> synapse circuits. They found that the performance of a network with <b>depressing</b> synapses that discriminates between burst and random input spikes increases nonmonotonically as the static device mismatch is increased. We designed a single-electron <b>depressing</b> synapse and constructed the same network as in Kanazawa’s study to develop noisetolerant single-electron circuits. We examined the temperature characteristics and explored possible architecture that enables single electron circuits to operate at T> 0 K. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the need and}} solution for minimizing EVA airlock time and <b>depress</b> gas losses using a new method that minimizes EVA out-the-door time for a suited astronaut and reclaims most of the airlock <b>depress</b> gas. This method consists {{of one or more}} related concepts that use an evacuated reservoir tank to store and reclaim the airlock <b>depress</b> gas. The evacuated tank can be an inflatable tank, a spent fuel tank from a lunar lander descent stage, or a backup airlock. During EVA airlock operations, the airlock and reservoir would be equalized at some low pressure, and through proper selection of reservoir size, most of the <b>depress</b> gas would be stored in the reservoir for later reclamation. The benefit of this method is directly applicable to long duration lunar and Mars missions that require multiple EVA missions (up to 100, two-person lunar EVAs) and conservation of consumables, including <b>depress</b> pump power and <b>depress</b> gas. The current ISS airlock gas reclamation method requires approximately 45 minutes of the astronaut s time in the airlock and 1 KW in electrical power. The proposed method would decrease the astronaut s time in the airlock because the <b>depress</b> gas is being temporarily stored in a reservoir tank for later recovery. Once the EVA crew is conducting the EVA, the volume in the reservoir would be pumped back to the cabin at a slow rate. Various trades were conducted to optimize this method, which include time to equalize the airlock with the evacuated reservoir versus reservoir size, pump power to reclaim <b>depress</b> gas versus time allotted, inflatable reservoir pros and cons (weight, volume, complexity), and feasibility of spent lunar nitrogen and oxygen tanks as reservoirs...|$|R
