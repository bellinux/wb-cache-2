5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust.

5|$|After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a {{collection}} of laws known as Łaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation became the basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> around 1520 of the szlachtas execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws.|$|E
5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most neptunium has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While neptunium itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft.

5|$|Another {{possible}} mechanism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of planetesimals is the streaming {{instability in}} which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals {{the size of the}} larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, SS-Nordland and SS-Westland {{had become}} the basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the fourth division, SS-Division Wiking. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were {{concentrated}} in the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve in the Allgemeine SS at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had been deployed {{to the area of}} occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.|$|E
5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the surface knobs.|$|E

The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones.

5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his reforms were implemented.|$|E

Typically it was created only as a temporary front-line unit while larger United States Marine units were formed. The brigade would then merge with these to form a Marine division. The 1942 brigade merged with the 2nd Marine Division, the 1944 brigade was the basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the new 6th Marine Division, and the 1950 brigade acted as an advance force for the newly reactivated 1st Marine Division before merging into that unit.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on the planktonic and benthonic foraminiferal content {{the lower}} and middle Miocene {{successions}} at the Gulf of Suez in Egypt {{have been identified}} (30 planktonic species and 101 benthonic species), seven paleoecologic parameters are studied, which include; foraminiferal frequency; predominance of the planktonic foraminiferal groups; predominance of benthonic foraminiferal groups, diversity of the foraminiferal species, P/B foraminiferal ratio, A/C foraminiferal ratio and benthonic genus/genera predominance.
