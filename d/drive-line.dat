40|$|The Dutch {{coast is}} {{characterized}} by sandy beaches flanked by dunes. Its morphology {{is essential for the}} defense against flooding of the hinterland. Therefore it is monitored on a yearly basis by Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS). However, it is recognized that most erosion of the beach and first dune row takes place during storms. To assess the state of the coast immediately after a storm with ALS is expensive and difficult to organize. Here, the performance of a Land-based Mobile Mapping System (LMMS) is evaluated. A test data set was obtained by Geomaat using the StreetMapper LMMS system, employing three individual line scanners. Both the relative quality of laser point heights and of a derived Digital Terrain model (DTM) are assessed. In the first analysis height differences between close-by points are considered. Except for arbitrary close-by points, also close-by points obtained from different scanners and from different <b>drive-lines</b> are analyzed. It is shown that on a flat beach a precision of 3 mm is achieved and that almost no internal biases exist. In the second analysis a DTM with a grid size of 1 m is obtained using least squares. Each grid point height includes a quality description, which incorporates both measurement precision and terrain roughness. Although some problems remain with the low scanning height of 2 m, which causes shadow-effect behind low dunes, it is concluded that a laser LMMS enables the acquisition of a high quality DTM product, which is available within two days...|$|R
50|$|Development {{of these}} trucks began around 1984 and were {{introduced}} in April 1987 as 1988 models (known as the GMT400 platform, and their nickname: OBS (Old Body Style) Chevy or GMC). There were eight {{different versions of the}} C/K line for 1988. Fleetside Single Cab, and Fleetside Extended Cab, were the first chevy trucks to be available with this type of cab version, and the 1973 to 1987 C10s and C20s where only available with a single cab. Fleetside Crew Cab, and Stepside Single Cab models, each in either 2WD (C) or 4WD (K) <b>drive-lines</b> were also available. All C/K models would ride on independent front suspension. Three trim levels were available: Cheyenne, Scottsdale, and Silverado. Engines were a 160 hp (119 kW) 4.3 L V6, a 175 hp (130 kW) 5.0 L V8, a 210 hp (157 kW) 5.7 L V8 and a 6.2 L diesel V8. A 230 hp (172 kW) 7.4 L V8 was available in the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks. Most of the powertrain were a carryover from the 1987 R/V with fuel injection. To enhance durability the trucks featured extensive use of galvanized steel for corrosion resistance and a fully welded frame with a boxed front section for strength and rigidity. During the development of the GMT400 platform GM designers based their prototypes on the compact GMT325 S-series (S10 and S15/Sonoma) - upon the official release the GMT400 were the first GM vehicles to use an electronic speedometer, and a serpentine accessory drive. Some consider the GMT400 as a scaled up version of the S10/Sonoma with rounded off contours - later incorporated into the second generation S-series.|$|R

40|$|Sound and {{vibration}} have {{a defining}} influence on {{our perception of}} product quality. They are especially well-known aspects in the automotive industry; a branch which sees, besides safety and driving comfort, ever-increasing expectations of the acoustic experience. After all, a smooth and silent driving experience appeals to a feeling of premiumness, a connotation no longer reserved to the top segment in the industry. While traditional combustion engines are gradually getting replaced by hybrid or full-electric <b>drive-lines,</b> other electromechanical (so-called mechatronic) systems make their entrance. As a consequence, the sound experience shifts from low-frequent engine roar to high-frequent humming and whining – a yet unfamiliar experience that calls for redefinition of the soundscape. To support such change, {{it is necessary that}} sound and vibration aspects can be considered in an early phase of development by means of simulations. This poses a true challenge: although state-of-art numerical modelling techniques can simulate the low-frequent dynamics fairly well, they often fail to provide reliable answers for the higher acoustic frequency range. This thesis presents techniques that aim to implement measurements of structural dynamics and active vibration sources into development processes. By characterising the passive and active dynamics of yet available components by means of measurements and combining those with numerical models, a hybrid simulation emerges that may provide answers to high-frequent problems in an early phase of development. This hybrid simulation is facilitated by use of Experimental Dynamic Substructuring : a methodology that determines structural dynamic aspects of complete products based on individually measured components. Part one of this thesis presents a variety of methods for simulation and substructuring that form the basic toolbox for generation, analysis, coupling and decoupling of dynamic models. Pivotal is the experimental approach, which means that dynamic models are obtained from measurements rather than numerical modelling efforts. To transform such measurements into a model that is compatible for coupling with other (numerical) models, the virtual point transformation is proposed. This method considers measured responses and applied forces around (user-chosen) points as locally rigid displacements and forces. Doing so, every connection point of a component can be described by three translations and three rotations with respect to a global reference frame, perfectly suited for substructuring. At the same time, the quality of the measurement and transformed frequency response functions can be quantified objectively using the proposed consistency functions. Altogether, the virtual point method bridges the gap between experimental and numerical modelling activities and enables us to exploit substructuring effectively for complex high-frequency systems. Part two presents a comprehensive study of Transfer Path Analysis (TPA); a collection of methods that contemplate a vibration problem as a source, transmission and receiver. A general framework for TPA is presented by re-interpreting eleven methods from the perspective of substructuring. It is shown that these methods can be categorised into three families, that in turn differ in the nature of characterisation of the source. The component-based TPA is regarded the most promising family, which allows to characterise a source independent of the environment in which it has been measured. The vibrations of the active source can be replaced by equivalent force spectra that, multiplied with the (simulated) FRFs of the assembled vehicle, predict what this source would sound like in the vehicle. Several practical methods are discussed to determine such equivalent forces: from forces measured against a blocked boundary, using free velocities, based on measurements on a compliant test bench or using the so-called in-situ and pseudo-forces methods. For further generalisation, a notation is presented that governs the abovementioned principles and facilitates the application and comparison of component-based TPA methods. In particular, it is shown that controllability and observability – concepts adopted from control theory – are strongly related to TPA; proper understanding of these principles yields interesting opportunities for analysis and simulation. The developed methods have been applied to analyse the vibrations of the electric power-assisted steering (EPS) system, which is reported on in part three. It is demonstrated that the virtual point transformation is able to determine accurate FRFs in a frequency range up to 6000 Hertz. Substructuring is applied to simulate the FRFs of a vehicle by applying the principle of substitute coupling, which employs a substitute beam during measurement in the vehicle to represent the dynamic effects of the steering system to couple. For the purpose of characterisation of the steering system’s excitations, several testing environments are discussed: a stiff test bench, more compliant test benches and the vehicle itself. Each configuration is accompanied by a specific method for source characterisation, for which it is demonstrated that the equivalent forces are indeed an environment-independent description of the active excitations of the steering system. It is shown that these forces can be used for the prediction of sound and vibrations in the vehicle. The presented applications offer, with understanding of substructuring and TPA theory, insights in the practical aspects of the methodology. This opens interesting opportunities for early-phase development of sound and vibration. Dynamics of Micro and Nano System...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} feature of the new Leyland buses was the engine; it was a six-cylinder overhead-camshaft petrol engine of 6.8 litres displacement, developing between 90-98 bhp at up to 2,200 rpm.

A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a sedan), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated <b>drive-line.</b> Everything from the pistons to the crankshaft to the rear axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model.

50|$|Whereas the RE used {{a complex}} stepped frame on bus variants. Seddon {{decided to use}} a {{straight}} frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex <b>drive-line</b> arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the rear cross member on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, {{to a variety of}} different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with resilient rubber-based joints. Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further {{from the rear of the}} frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling wedge-type drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid-wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible fan drive was announced but this was never made available to customers.|$|E
40|$|Today's {{design of}} <b>drive-line</b> {{components}} {{takes place on}} the basis of criteria of the fatigue analysis.

A central part of each fatigue analysis are the load spectra, {{on the basis of}} which the calculation of the appropriate <b>drive-line</b> components takes place. Within the scope of this work, the influence of different parameters on the load spectra of an automatic transmission and thus on the relative fatigue of an automatic transmission were investigated. The relative fatigue is calculated both at the entrance shaft of the transmission and at the gear wheels of the transmission. The calculated relative fatigues at the entrance shaft of the transmission and at the gear wheels of the transmission are always in reference to the appropriate calculated fatigue of the reference configuration. The investigations take place based on the simulation environment developed at the Institute of Machine Components (MA) at the University of Stuttgart. The simulation environment contains the <b>drive-line</b> simulation program FASIMA II, the traffic simulation program VERSIMA and the road profile measuring system SASIMA. The simulation environment was extended according to the requirements of this work. Among other things the <b>drive-line</b> simulation program FASIMA II was extended by several <b>drive-line</b> modules and by various classification methods for the determination of load spectra. The investigated parameters can be divided into the fields (a) vehicle-specific parameters, (b) traffic-specific parameters and (c) driver-specific parameters. (orig.)

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{reversed}} system witnessed rapid {{consumption of the}} front frame within the first 20 milliseconds of the impact leading to transfer of huge amount of the impact load on the other components. As a result both the radiator and the sheet metal experienced unreasonably high peak deformation. Some of the interior structures which include; the torque box and the engine mount equally show extended deformation, suggesting increased structural intrusion and poor energy management scheme (Figure  5 b).

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} in load handling {{can be made}} to light trucks with the application of a tandem rear suspension. Most current concepts involve two complete axle assemblies with all the associated drive components. This concept is good, but an alternative method of transferring power to the rear most axle that is discussed in this paper provides additional benefits. This research effort resulted in a preliminary design for a drive box that will allow the driver to disengage the rear most axle when extra traction is not required. By disengaging part of the <b>drive-line,</b> there is an increase in system efficiency versus the current methods. The resulting design is mechanically sound, but as will be discussed, may not be an economically and weight feasible idea...|$|E
40|$|In {{national}} and European discussions, {{it appears that}} the conventional sound measurement techniques are insufficient to answer some relevant questions with respect to source strength of road vehicles. An example of such a question is: What is the importance of tyre-road noise {{on the one hand and}} <b>drive-line</b> noise on the other hand in every day traffic? TNO TPD has developed measurement techniques, based on array technology, that enable the assessment of source strengths of complex sound sources, such as passing road vehicles, passing trains or industrial sources. These methods aim to distinguish the different partial sources in one dimension (Syntacan) or two dimensions (Acoustic Camera) and to measure their calibrated source-strength levels. The Dutch ministry of Environment (VROM) supported the application of these techniques by TNO TPD within the European HARMONOISE project. The objective was to show the ability of array measurements to provide both sound exposure levels (SELs) and heights. Tests were conducted at TRL (UK) to determine the accuracy of two array methods developed by TNO TPD by comparison with the subtraction method. The data measured by TNO TPD resulted in one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional 'sound photographs' of the vehicles, in different circumstances. The 'sound photographs' present calibrated source strength levels with similar accuracy as those obtained with single microphone techniques measured by TRL and on top of that, provide spatial information of the source strength distribution. Based on these results it can be concluded that the Acoustic Camera and Syntacan can serve in the assessment of road, vehicle noise. This could be done in various ways and for various objectives such as monitoring of tyre-road noise in real traffic, determining effects of the road surface on tyre-road noise and <b>drive-line</b> noise...|$|E
40|$|January Progress [...] A {{kick-off}} meeting {{was held in}} San Diego with Alturdyne on January 21 st. The proposed hybrid gas/electric chiller/cogenerator design concept was discussed in detail. The requirements and functionality of the key component, a variable speed, constant frequency motor/generator was presented. Variations of the proposed design were also discussed based on their technical feasibility, cost and market potential. The discussion is documented in a Trip Report. February Progress [...] After significant GRI/Alturdyne discussion regarding alternative product design concepts, the team {{made a decision to}} continue with the proposed product design, a hybrid chiller capable of also providing emergency power. The primary benefits are: (a) the flexibility and operating cost savings associated with the product's dual fuel capability and (b) the emergency power feature. A variable speed, constant frequency motor/generator would significantly increase the cost of the product while providing marginal benefit. (The variable speed, constant frequency motor generator is estimated to cost $ 25, 000 versus $ 4, 000 for a constant speed version). In addition, the interconnection requirements to the electric grid would significantly limit market penetration of the product. We will proceed with a motor/generator design capable of serving as the electric prime mover for the compressor as well as the generator for emergency power needs. This component design is being discussed with two motor manufacturers. The first generation motor/generator will not be a variable speed, constant frequency design. The variable speed, constant frequency capability can be an advancement that is included at a later time. The induction motor/synchronous generator starts as a wound rotor motor with a brushless exciter and control electronics to switch between induction mode and synchronous mode. The exciter is a three-phase exciter with three phase rotating diode assembly. In the induction motor mode, the field windings are shorted out by SCRs located across the field. In the synchronous mode, a small ct on one of the exciter leads would power the rotating exciter electronics. Upon sensing exciter current, the electronics would automatically open the SCRs allowing synchronous operation. Quotes will be obtained from American Motor and Reuland, two motor/generator vendors. March Progress [...] A product layout was completed. The width is reduced significantly from the original hybrid design because the evaporator and condenser tube in shell heat exchangers are located below the engine/motor/compressor <b>drive-line.</b> Alturdyne is searching for a consultant to perform a <b>drive-line</b> torsional analysis.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{attractiveness of}} various hybrid/electric power train configurations and electrical and mechanical <b>drive-line</b> components was studied. The initial screening was concerned primarily with {{total vehicle weight}} and economic factors and identified the hybrid power train combinations which warranted detailed evaluation over various driving cycles. This was done using a second-by-second vehicle simulation program which permitted the calculations of fuel economy, electricity usage, and emissions {{as a function of}} distance traveled in urban and highway driving. Power train arrangement possibilities were examined in terms of their effect on vehicle handling, safety, serviceability, and passenger comfort. A dc electric drive system utilizing a separately excited motor with field control and battery switching was selected for the near term hybrid vehicle. Hybrid vehicle simulations showed that for the first 30 mi (the electric range of the vehicle) in urban driving, the fuel economy was 80 mpg using a gasoline engine and 100 mpg using a diesel engine. In urban driving the hybrid would save about 75 % of the fuel used by the conventional vehicle and in combined urban/highway driving the fuel saving is about 50 %...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a test rig {{for the experimental}} validation of theoretical models to analyze the automotive <b>drive-line</b> dynamic behaviour accounting {{for the presence of}} oil between the impacting teeth of the gear pairs. The rig is constituted by a single gear pair, driven by an electric motor controlled in speed by an inverter. The peculiarity of the rig is its versatility in order to compare various gear pairs with different tooth parameters and different lubrication conditions. In particular the experimental study regards the acquisition of vibrations, originated during the impacts of an unloaded gear pair, responsible of the “gear rattle noise” phenomenon. At the present the automotive manufacturers investigate experimentally the gear rattle phenomenon generally comparing different cases by the measures of the noise level using microphones. The study aims to measure the gears relative angular displacements of an unloaded gear pair by two encoders, fitted on the primary and secondary shaft, and successively reconstructing the relative motion of the teeth along the contact line. Some results of the first experimental tests, conducted in dry conditions, are reported. The results confirm the test rig capability in detecting the relative motion between the impacting tooth...|$|E
40|$|The aim of HARMONOISE Work Package 1. 1 is the {{characterisation}} and modelling of {{road vehicle}} noise emission. Measurement of partial sources related {{to either the}} drive line or the tyre-road contact of moving vehicles and their contribution to the total vehicle pass-by noise {{is one of the}} research issues. TNO TPD has developed array measurement techniques that enable the assessment of 'calibrated' source strengths levels of moving complex sound sources and provide spatial information of the source strength distribution. The Dutch ministry of Environment (VROM) supported the application of these techniques by TNO TPD in a joint experiment with TRL within the European HARMONOISE project. The objective was to show the applicability of the methods and to demonstrate their specific features and possibilities. Data from one-dimensional (Syntacan) and two-dimensional (Acoustic Camera) antenna measurements on passing passenger cars and heavy vehicles were compared with single microphone measurement results. Based on these results it can be concluded that the Acoustic Camera and Syntacan can serve in the assessment of road vehicle noise. The methods may be used for various objectives such as monitoring of tyre-road noise and <b>drive-line</b> noise in real traffic and determining effects of the road surface on tyre-road noise...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND In {{the setting}} of a {{progressive}} shortage of donors for heart transplantation, {{there has been a}} movement in recent years towards a new generation of ventricular assist devices (VAD’s). These VAD’s are based on continuous rather than pulsatile flow and are smaller and thus easier to implant. They offer greater durability with the prospect of implantation as a permanent (destination) device. Pulsatile VADs implanted at the Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) include the Thoratec and the Novacor. Since the end of 2006, the pulsatile VADs have become obsolete and are no longer implanted. The centrifugal Ventrassist VAD has been used at the Alfred hospital since 2003. Although widely adopted, there remains a lack of knowledge of what effect non-pulsatile devices have on bacteraemia, end- organ function and vascular structure and reactivity. The first two studies were retrospective studies (Chapters 3 & 4) and the remainder of the chapters were prospective studies (Chapters 5, 6 & 7). The aims of this research were: 1. To determine the effect of device type (pulsatile vs non-pulsatile) on the incidence of bacteraemia 2. To compare the incidence of impaired end organ function including gastrointestinal complications, neurological symptoms and renal impairment in non-pulsatile vs pulsatile VADs 3. To determine the effect of VAD implantation on vascular function as assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements 4. To determine the effect of VAD implantation and of pulsatile and non-pulsatile flow on the endothelium as assessed by blood borne endothelial markers 5. To determine the effect of cardiac transplantation on vascular function and endothelial markers. 6. To determine the effect of the following on intima-medial thickness: heart failure, VAD implantation whether pulsatile or non-pulsatile and transplantation. Bacteraemia and VAD infections Infection is a significant source of morbidity and mortality after VAD implantation. Since the introduction of the considerably smaller non-pulsatile flow VADs, which require much smaller pump pockets than the pulsatile VADs, we assume that they would have less exposure to infection. With much smaller <b>drive-line</b> exit sites, the non-pulsatile devices certainly have an potential advantage of lower risk of infection and being the newer device on the market, medical staff looking after patients with a VAD in situ, have a much better understanding of detecting and treating infections than before. In our study we examined the incidence of bacteraemia and infectious complications in patients receiving pulsatile and non-pulsatile VADs. At the end of the study, we concluded that device type including differences in pulsatility made no difference to the incidence of bacteraemia. GI complications and End-organ function We observed more gastrointestinal (GI) problems with the CF than with the pulsatile devices. Motility problems and bowel infarctions were likely to be due to gut ischemia contributed by non-pulsatile flow. In the current era an overall reduction in GI problems has been clearly demonstrated with the newer CF devices. These improvements are likely to be due to more careful patient selection, better preoperative optimization, improved operative techniques, and enhanced postoperative management. Since these improvements have been introduced, the incidence of ischaemic-type GI complications fallen. However, GI bleeding remains a problem. VASCULAR FUNCTION AND STRUCTURE Function and structure of the vascular system was evaluated utilising the following approaches: • Measurement of endothelium-dependent regulation of vascular tone at focal sites of the circulation (Flow Mediated Vasodilation [FMD]) • Measurement of vascular reactivity using Venous Occlusion Plethysmography / Forearm Blood Flow [FBF] • Measurement of morphologic characteristics of the vascular wall using Intima- media thickness (IMT) • Determination of soluble endothelial markers (e. g. Von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator and adhesion molecules) Flow Mediated Dilation Arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), assessed by high-resolution ultrasonography, reflects endothelium-dependent vasodilator function. Endothelial function is known to be impaired in patients with heart failure (HF), but the vascular effects of a non-pulsatile ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation, now used as either a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy, remain unclear. Using flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), this study aimed to provide greater insight into VAD-induced changes in vascular function. In our study we did not see significant changes either VAD implantation, whether pulsatile or non-pulsatile, or transplantation, but observed a deterioration over time. Intima Medial Thickness The carotid intima medial thickness was increased in heart failure patients, but no effects of VAD implantation or pulsatility were observed. IMT measurements did however decrease over time after VAD insertion and also after heart transplantation. Forearm Blood Flow In this study, patients with heart failure had decreased vascular reactivity compared to the normal subjects. Patients receiving a VAD showed an increase in vascular function, however, patients supported with pulsatile VADs had superior vascular reactivity compared to patients supported with non-pulsatile flow VADs, indicating that the pulsatile blood flow characteristics of pulsatile VADs offer significant benefits in vascular reactivity over the continuous blood flow characteristics of non- pulsatile flow VADs. There was no change observed over time or after heart transplantation. Endothelial Markers After analysing the endothelial markers before and after VAD insertion, between pulsatile and non-pulsatile flow, it was clear that there were no real differences between the two groups. The markers for both groups were elevated within the first few days after device implantation but declined later as would be expected when a foreign body is introduced. As was shown with the FMD and FBF, the body adapts to these devices over time, whether pulsatile or non-pulsatile. Summary A marked increase in GI complications was found in the patients who received a non-pulsatile device. Pulsatile devices were found to improve vascular function as evidenced by FBF. Therefore it is likely that having a pulse should reduce GI and other complications, particularly in the early post-operative phase when patients are at their most vulnerable. The lack of pulsatility may be the one factor that has been overlooked all these years and future research should focus on methods to generate pulsatility in these newer continuous flow devices...|$|E
