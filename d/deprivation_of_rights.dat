In Mathews v. Eldridge, the Court explained the level of due process required for the termination of Social Security benefits and, in doing so, established a method for determining the level of procedural due process required in depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. The Court did so by balancing state interests against the procedural due process rights of an individual. The Mathews test takes into account three factors: [...] "the private interests affected by the proceeding", [...] "the risk of error created by the State's chosen procedure", and [...] "the countervailing governmental interest supporting use of the challenged procedure." ...|$|E
