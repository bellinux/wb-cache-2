40|$|High-temperature gas chromatography/mass {{spectrometry}} (HT-GC/MS) {{has been}} employed {{to study the}} behavior of mixtures of triacylglycerol molecular species on a polarizable stationary phase (immobilized 65 % phenyl methyl silicone). The use of negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) at an ion source block temperature of 300 °C overcomes problems with interpretation of electron ionization (EI) mass spectra produced during the HT-GC/MS. The NICI spectra of triacylglycerols produced under these conditions contain abundant [RCO 2]−, [RCO 2 - 18]−, and [RCO 2 - 19]− ions, believed to be produced by nucleophilic gas-phase ammonolysis, {{that are used to}} identify the individual fatty acid moieties associated with peaks in triacylglycerol total ion chromatograms. The polarizable stationary phase produces significantly enhanced resolution of triacylglycerol molecular species compared to hightemperature stable apolar stationary phases, such as immobilized <b>dimethyl</b> <b>polysiloxanes.</b> The resolution of complex natural mixtures of triacylglycerols can be further improved by use of the Biller-Biemann enhancement technique to produce mass-resolved chromatograms. Investigation of the mass-resolved chromatograms provides important information with regard to the factors that affect elution orders of individual triacylglycerol molecular species. The analysis of mixtures of authentic triacylglycerols by HT-GC/MS via NICI provides data that relate to the analytical limits of the technique for the analysis of triacylglycerols that bear both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties...|$|R
40|$|Atomic-oxygen erosion on {{spacecraft}} in low Earth orbit is {{an issue}} which is becoming increasingly important because of {{the growing number of}} spacecraft that will fly in the orbits which have high concentrations of atomic oxygen. In this investigation, the atomic-oxygen durability of three types of electrical wire insulation (carbon-based, fluoropolymer, and polysiloxane elastomer) were evaluated. These insulation materials were exposed to thermal-energy atomic oxygen, which was obtained by RF excitation of air at a pressure of 11 - 20 Pa. The effects of atomic-oxygen exposure on insulation materials indicate that all carbon-based materials erode at about the same rate as polyamide Kapton and, therefore, are not atomic-oxygen durable. However, the durability of fluoropolymers needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis because the erosion rates of fluoropolymers vary widely. For example, experimental data suggest the formation of atomic fluorine during atomic-oxygen amorphous-fluorocarbon reactions. <b>Dimethyl</b> <b>polysiloxanes</b> (silicone) do not lose mass during atomic-oxygen exposure, but develop silica surfaces which are under tension and frequently crack as a result of loss of methyl groups. However, if the silicone sample surfaces were properly pretreated to provide a certain roughness, atomic oxygen exposure resulted in a sturdy, non-cracked atomic-oxygen durable SiO 2 layer. Since the surface does not crack during such silicone-atomic oxygen reaction, the crack-induced contamination by silicone can be reduced or completely stopped. Therefore, with proper pretreatment, silicone can be either a wire insulation material or a coating on wire insulation materials to provide atomic-oxygen durability...|$|R

40|$|A {{selected}} and trained descriptive sensory panel has assessed samples of crisps and French fries prepared on an industrial scale with either sunflower oil (SO) or high oleic sunflower oil (HOBO). Furthermore, crisps have been fried in these oils {{with or without}} <b>dimethyl</b> <b>polysiloxane</b> (DMPS). Reference samples were prepared using palm olein (PO) or hydrogenated rapeseed/palm oil mixture (RP).

Since propolis is used extensively, a rapid and efficient method for the extraction and analysis of propolis is certainly very useful. With the aim to determine polyphenols in propolis we have applied RP-HPLC coupled with DAD and MS detection, using the new fused-core column technology, which allowed a sensitive reduction in the total analysis time in comparison with conventional particulate stationary phases. The HPLC analyses were carried out on an Ascentis Express C 18 column (150 mm × 3. 0 mm I.

40|$|Factors {{involved}} in the determination of PAHs (16 priority PAHs as an example) and PCBs (10 PCB congeners, representing 10 isomeric groups) by capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS, for PAHs) and electron capture detection (GC/ECD, for PCBs) were studied, with emphasis {{on the effect of}} solvent. Having various volatilities and different polarities, solvent studied included dichloromethane, acetonitrile, hexan e, cyclohexane, isooctane, octane, nonane, dodecane, benzene, toluene, p-xylene, o-xylene, and mesitylene. Temperatures of the capillary column, the injection port, the GC/MS interface, the flow rates of carrier gas and make-up gas, and the injection volume were optimized by one factor at a time method or simplex optimization method. Under the optimized conditions, both peak height and peak area of 16 PAHs, especially the late-eluting PAHs, were significantly enhanced (1 to 500 times) by using relatively higher boiling point solvents such as p-xylene and nonane, compared with commonly used solvents like benzene and isooctane. With the improved sensitivity, detection limits of between 4. 4 pg for naphthalene and 30. 8 pg for benzo[g,h,i]perylene were obtained when p-xylene was used as an injection solvent. Effect of solvent on peak shape and peak intensity were found to be greatly dependent on temperature parameters, especially the initial temperature of the capillary column. The relationship between initial temperature and shape of peaks from 16 PAHs and 10 PCBs were studied and compared when toluene, p-xylene, isooctane, and nonane were used as injection solvents. If a too low initial temperature was used, fronting or split of peaks was observed. On the other hand, peak tailing occurred at a too high initial column temperature. The optimum initial temperature, at which both peak fronting and tailing were avoided and symmetrical peaks were obtained, depended on both solvents and the stationary phase of the column used. On a methyl silicone column, the alkane solvents provided wider optimum ranges of initial temperature than aromatic solvents did, for achieving well-shaped symmetrical GC peaks. On a 5 % diphenyl: 1 % vinyl: 94 % <b>dimethyl</b> <b>polysiloxane</b> column, when the aromatic solvents were used, the optimum initial temperature ranges for solutes to form symmetrical peaks were improved to a similar degree as those when the alkanes were used as injection solvents. A mechanism, based on the properties of and possible interactions among the analyte, the injection solvent, and the stationary phase of the capillary column, was proposed to explain these observations. The effect of initial temperature on peak height and peak area of the 16 PAHs and the 10 PCBs was also studied. The optimum initial temperature was found to be dependent on the physical properties of the solvent used and the amount of the solvent injected. Generally, from the boiling point of the solvent to 10 0 C above its boiling point was an optimum range of initial temperature at which cthe highest peak height and peak area were obtained...|$|E
