40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{explaining}} governance structure variety in franchising, we explore the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor {{as well as the}} distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and mixed (<b>dual</b> <b>distribution)</b> franchise systems are considered. Circumstances are identified when a <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> governance structure uniquely allocates efficient ownership over assets. Whether <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> benefits are realized in a franchise or a cooperative franchise depends on whether most value is added upstream or downstream. A disadvantage of a <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> system is the deterioration of the investment incentives of the party having no authority, i. e. either the company-owned outlet manager in a traditional franchise or the franchisor in a cooperative franchise.

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to compute the conditional moments of fat-tailed phenomena that, only looking at data, could be mistakenly considered as having infinite mean.

The tail of the <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> can then be studied using extreme value theory, without making excessive parametric assumptions, and the estimates one obtains can be used to study the original distribution and compute its moments by reverting the log- transformation.

40|$|Water {{scarcity}} and deteriorating {{water infrastructure}} are of growing {{concern in the}} United States. The conventional methods of treating and transporting potable water and wastewater are being challenged as new technology creates opportunities for water reuse. Instead of simply replacing the current infrastructure for centralized treatment systems, alternatives such as <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> and decentralized treatment systems are being investigated as more sustainable alternatives. Implementing <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> systems leads to benefits such as {{reducing the amount of}} water treated to potable standards and reducing freshwater withdrawals. A <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> system allows the non-potable demands to be shifted from the potable water supply to a lower quality water source such as greywater, rainwater, or reclaimed wastewater. Removing demands such as fire flow, irrigation, laundry, and toilet flushing from the potable demand reduces the demand and allows potable water to be treated to higher water quality standards in a more efficient and cost effective way. A <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> system allows water to be treated to the levels necessary for the end use instead of treating all water to drinking water standards. Before water reuse can be widely implemented, the infrastructure requirements for <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> need to be understood. Once the infrastructure requirements are known, they can be evaluated using economic and life-cycle analyses to determine the overall feasibility of the systems. The infrastructure requirements are determined through the use of EPANET 2, a hydraulic model developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Scenarios utilizing systems such as using untreated greywater for subsurface irrigation require the least amount of infrastructure. As the complexity of the system increases so does the required infrastructure. In this study, the infrastructure requirements are determined for the following scenarios: greywater and rainwater for non-potable use in single-family residences, rainwater for non-potable use in an apartment building, and reclaimed wastewater use in a community...|$|E

Our explanation rests on the observation that franchisors often acquire private information, not available to franchisees, on product demand through marketing efforts. Under this assumption of asymmetric information, we show that a franchisor will use both direct ownership as well as the franchise contract to convey information about a new product. This explanation for <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> relies neither on capital market imperfections nor upon location-specific factors, in contrast to alternative explanations advanced in the literature Testable implications of the signaling model are discussed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} using contact sensors to estimate the pose of an object during planar pushing by a fixed-shape hand. Contact sensors are unique because they inherently discriminate between “contact ” and “no-contact ” configurations. As a result, the set of object configurations that activates a sensor constitutes a lower-dimensional contact manifold in the configuration space of the object. This causes conventional state estimation methods, such as the particle filter, to perform poorly during periods of contact due to particle starvation. In this paper, we introduce the manifold particle filter as a principled way of solving the state estimation problem when the state moves between multiple manifolds of different dimensionality. The manifold particle filter avoids particle starvation during contact by adaptively sampling particles that reside on the contact manifold from the <b>dual</b> proposal <b>distribution.</b> We describe three techniques—one analytical, and two sample-based—of sampling from the <b>dual</b> proposal <b>distribution</b> and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. We present simulation results that show that all three techniques outperform the conventional particle filter in both speed and accuracy. Additionally, we implement the manifold particle filter on a real robot and show that it successfully tracks the pose of a pushed object using commercially available tactile sensors. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{circumstances}} in which manufacturers provide inputs to wholesale customers only to subsequently compete with these wholesale customers in the retail realm.

This paper demonstrates that with <b>dual</b> <b>distribution,</b> a manufacturer can benefit from decentralized control {{and the use of}} transfer prices above marginal cost. Although these arrangements often create coordination concerns, a moderate presence of such concerns permits the manufacturer to credibly convey to its wholesale customer that it will not excessively encroach on its retail territory. This, in turn, permits the manufacturer to reap greater wholesale profits. We also note that this force can point to a silver lining in arm's-length (parity) requirements on transfer pricing in that they can solidify commitments to a particular retail posture. decentralization, supply chains, transfer pricing...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates two questions: the {{determinants}} of capital structure in franchising and its subsequent impact on the franchise financing decisions; and the efficient governance structure choice in franchising. We posit that firms franchise in order {{to benefit from the}} reduced franchisees’ operational risks by limiting the debt level, such that the franchisor can bear more debt and gain tax-deduction benefits. Specific hypotheses are based on various theories like resource-based view, agency theory, signaling theory and classical capital structure theories. We empirically find that as the franchisor requires franchisees to put more equity in the initial investment, the franchisor does bear a higher debt level and gains from tax deductibility of interest expenses. This effect is stronger when more units are franchised. Moreover, we also find evidence supporting our prediction that the franchisee’s leverage is positively linked with franchisor’s maturity. This suggests that as the franchisor imposes a higher level of franchisee’s leverage in order to screen capable franchisees, the franchisor also increases their maturity to reduce bankruptcy risks. This thesis also explores the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor as well as the distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and mixed franchise systems are considered.

Introducing {{what we call the}} <b>dual</b> <b>distribution,</b> we show how to deal with heavy-tailed phenomena with a remote yet finite upper bound. We provide methods to compute relevant tail quantities such as the Expected Shortfall, which is not available under infinite-mean models, allowing adequate provisioning and capital allocation.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis we explore three {{fundamental}} questions that arise naturally when we conceive a machine learning scenario where the training and test distributions can differ. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that in fact mismatched training and test distribution can yield better out-of-sample performance. This optimal performance can be obtained by training with the <b>dual</b> <b>distribution.</b> This optimal training distribution depends on the test distribution set by the problem, but not on the target function that we want to learn. We show how to obtain this distribution in both discrete and continuous input spaces, as well as how to approximate it in a practical scenario. Benefits of using this distribution are exemplified in both synthetic and real data sets. In order to apply the <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> in the supervised learning scenario where the training data set is fixed, it is necessary to use weights to make the sample appear as if it came from the <b>dual</b> <b>distribution.</b> We explore the negative effect that weighting a sample can have. The theoretical decomposition of the use of weights regarding its effect on the out-of-sample error is easy to understand but not actionable in practice, as the quantities involved cannot be computed. Hence, we propose the Targeted Weighting algorithm that determines if, for a given set of weights, the out-of-sample performance will improve or not in a practical setting. This is necessary as the setting assumes there are no labeled points distributed according to the test distribution, only unlabeled samples. Finally, we propose a new class of matching algorithms that can be used to match the training set to a desired distribution, such as the <b>dual</b> <b>distribution</b> (or the test distribution). These algorithms can be applied to very large datasets, and we show how they lead to improved performance in a large real dataset such as the Netflix dataset. Their computational complexity is the main reason for their advantage over previous algorithms proposed in the covariate shift literature. In the second part of the thesis we apply Machine Learning to the problem of behavior recognition. We develop a specific behavior classifier to study fly aggression, and we develop a system that allows analyzing behavior in videos of animals, with minimal supervision. The system, which we call CUBA (Caltech Unsupervised Behavior Analysis), allows detecting movemes, actions, and stories from time series describing the position of animals in videos. The method summarizes the data, as well as it provides biologists with a mathematical tool to test new hypotheses. Other benefits of CUBA include finding classifiers for specific behaviors without the need for annotation, as well as providing means to discriminate groups of animals, for example, according to their genetic line. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer's <b>dual</b> <b>distributions</b> channels consisting {{on the one}} hand of a virtual (online) channel operated directly by a manufacturer {{and on the other hand}} of a real (offline) channel operated by an intermediate retailer. Customers are assumed heterogeneous in their virtual acceptance, deriving a surplus according to the channel they shop at. Assuming that customers' derived benefits are random with a known probability distribution, we obtain a probabilistic model, which is used to construct an inter-temporal model for shopping online. In addition, we suppose that the retailer uses a markup pricing strategy and has a strategic role. This results in a Stackleberg differential game where the manufacturer is leader and the retailer is a follower. The optimal policy shows that the manufacturer charges the same price across both channels. This finding is consistent with classical results in economics. However, our research goes beyond this observation and indicates that the online price, the retailer's markup and the probability to buy are affected by consumers' heterogeneity in a specific manner. Moreover, we show that while the retailer sets a price equal to the product value, the online price is lower and is equal to the product value less the guarantee provided by the manufacturer for the risk the customer take to buy online. This guarantee is not discriminating and is set to the risk of the customer with the lowest virtual acceptance. Finally, we show that the introduction of the online store is a win-win strategy; both the customers and the manufacturer are better off.
