5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> but suggested that the <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. <b>Heart</b> <b>attacks</b> are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and heart failure.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, {{a massive}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> left him half paralyzed, with brain damage. After that, his health inexorably declined.

5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to <b>heart</b> <b>attacks).</b>|$|E
5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, who were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health had deteriorated as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience the miniature <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but {{the evidence}} was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of the}} medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria Island, {{where two}} people died of fatigue-related <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> after {{being caught in}} a rip current. Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E

40|$|Depression is 3 {{times more}} com-mon in {{patients}} after a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> {{than in the}} general population, with 15 % to 20 % of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> victims qualifying for a diagnosis of major depressive dis-order, and a far greater proportion expe-riencing increased levels of depressive symptoms. This comes as no surprise, given that major life stressors are known {{to contribute to the}} development of de-pression, and a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> certainly qualifies as such a stressor. Depression after a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> is bad not only because of the accompanying emotional distress and suffering; it also increases one’s risk of having another <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or dying over the ensuing months and years. Listed in Table 1 are several characteristics that have been found in depressed persons that could account for a poorer prognosis after a <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> How Can I Tell if I’m Depressed?

5|$|Willkie's {{condition}} only worsened as {{the weeks}} went on. He went to New York by rail in mid-September, but on the trip he was stricken with another heart attack. Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip, Willkie pressed on. When he arrived in New York, Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance {{to take him to}} Lenox Hill Hospital. He recovered to some extent, enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged. He spent time working on the galleys of his second book, An American Program, and planned future projects. On October 4, Willkie caught a throat infection, which was treated with penicillin. As he was recovering, Willkie's now chronic <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7. The hospital, which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public, was now forced to inform the public that Willkie's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill. The next morning, Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal. From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital, he was said to have suffered over a dozen <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
