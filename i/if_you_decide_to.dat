25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E

[...] The website says that [...] "sexual desires can be ... changeable" [...] and [...] "shifts in sexuality can and do occur for some individuals", but notes that therapy focusing on [...] "a change in sexual orientation" [...] is [...] "unethical".|$|E
2500|$|Vanguard {{journalist}} Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book, [...] "The simple impression I get is {{that the}} man is a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person; the ultimate Mr. Big Shot. He will be your friend if you come to him with genuine friendship, but he will give you a fight of your life <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> fight. That is my kind of person." [...] Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times the book inspired her at a young age to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly wrote, [...] "Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump." [...] London Review of Books wrote that the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers. The Washington Free Beacon rated the work's cover as the second best of all of Trump's book covers, and characterized the book as exemplifying [...] "The Trumpean Ideal".|$|E

50|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> not <b>to</b> evacuate, {{families}} and individuals should carefully monitor the hurricane updates provided by local the local {{television and radio}} crews.

I have told you about the possible change in my position, and that I was shortly leaving for England.

At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll Zero.
