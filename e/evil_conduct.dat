50|$|The first Emissaries of Evil was {{recruited}} by Electro in {{a plot of}} revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of Gladiator, Stilt-Man, Leap-Frog, and the Matador. Electro established his headquarters {{in one of the}} city's power plants. Daredevil happened across Electro meeting with Matador and attacked them, but Electro waylaid him with an electric blast and Electro fled with Matador. Electro then instructed Gladiator, Stilt-Man, Leap-Frog, and Matador to wait {{in different parts of the}} city for Daredevil to show up. Later, as part of Electro's plan, the Matador followed Daredevil and ambushed him, but Daredevil easily overcame him. Then Daredevil over came Stilt-Man. Leap-Frog then attacked Daredevil in Centrap Park. Although the villains were defeated, they were able to return to Electro's hideout. When Daredevil arrived, the Emissaries of <b>Evil</b> <b>conducted</b> one final mass-assault on Daredevil. Daredevil successfully defeated all of them and wrapped the whole group up in a lasso made from an electric wire so that they couldn't break free. Daredevil then left them for the police.|$|R

Gradually Mr. Greenwood learnt to talk of the female young person with very little of that respect which he showed to other members of the family.

With sighs of penitence, the Preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and her lover within the walls of the Preceptory--"But my defence," [...] he concluded, [...] "has been made in my confession to our most reverend father the Grand Master; he knows my motives were not <b>evil,</b> though my <b>conduct</b> may have been irregular.

40|$|This thesis explores text-music {{relationships}} in Dallapiccola’s Goethe Lieder. Though the cycle {{is based on}} Goethe’s West-östlicher divan, it was Mann’s novel Joseph und seine Brüder that spurred its inception. This seven-song cycle revolves around Suleika, a character from the biblical love story of Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife. Dallapiccola set this text upon reading Mann’s novel, which stems from the same story; however, Mann portrayed the character of Suleika as a sympathetic lover rather than the traditional <b>evil</b> seductress. By <b>conducting</b> a thorough pitch structure analysis of each song, focusing in particular on motives, symmetry and aggregates, this thesis examines text-music relationships to demonstrate how Mann’s Suleika is musically represented. This thesis illustrates that Dallapiccola’s setting is a musical composite of both Goethe and Mann’s Suleikas and thus sheds new analytical and hermeneutic light on an important work {{by one of the}} twentieth-century’s most prominent serial composers...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the “Evil Waiter Case,” a famous hypothetical fact pattern {{that has been}} the subject of much debate in the German, Spanish, and Latin American criminal law literature, but that unfortunately has not found its way into Anglo-American scholarly writings. The case presents us with a waiter who notices that the filet mignon she is taking to her assigned table is covered in a poisoned mushroom wine sauce. She nevertheless takes the dish to the table. The patron eats the poisoned filet mignon and dies several minutes later. Did the evil waiter kill the hungry patron or did she merely let him die? This essay argues that the <b>evil</b> waiter’s <b>conduct</b> shares morally relevant features of both actions and omissions, although it is neither purely active nor purely omissive conduct. It is, for lack of a better word, an “actmission” that is more blameworthy than a pure omission but less worthy of condemnation than purely active wrongdoing. Conduct counts as an actmission if it amounts to a failure to rescue (e. g. waiter fails to rescue patron) that is accomplished by engaging in a willed bodily movement (waiter places dish in front of patron). As a result of the hybrid nature of her <b>conduct,</b> the <b>evil</b> waiter should be punished more severely than if she had merely failed to rescue the patron, but less harshly than if she had actively killed the patron. More importantly, the Evil Waiter Case reveals that judges should not be forced to describe criminal conduct as either an act or an omission. Instead, American criminal law ought to recognize “actmissions” as a distinct category of conduct. Such actmissions should be punished more than pure omissions but less than entirely active conduct. Criminal law would thus be better served by replacing the act/omission distinction with the act/omission/actmission tristinction...|$|R

[...] For this Ma Chao asked Yan Wen whether the latter treasured his very own life, but Yan did not reply. Since Ma Chao had been struggling to breach the city wall for a long time, he wanted to lure the influential Yan Wen to change allegiance, so he gave Yan Wen another chance, asking whether the latter knew anyone inside the city who would welcome the invaders, but the old man still remained silent. Now, Ma Chao was irritated and censured the elder venomously, causing Yan Wen to finally stand up and say, [...] "A gentleman serving a lord can die for him but not betray him, yet you desired an old man to <b>conduct</b> <b>evil</b> speeches! Am I a person who would rather live in shame?" [...] Then, a speechless Ma Chao executed Yan Wen in rage.|$|R

60|$|The {{distinction}} between the loss of consideration which a person may rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and the reprobation {{which is due to}} him for an offence against the rights of others, is not a merely nominal distinction. It makes a vast difference both in our feelings and in our conduct towards him, whether he displeases us in things in which we think {{we have a right to}} control him, or in things in which we know that we have not. If he displeases us, we may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel called on to make his life uncomfortable. We shall reflect that he already bears, or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he spoils his life by mismanagement, we shall not, for that reason, desire to spoil it still further: instead of wishing to punish him, we shall rather endeavour to alleviate his punishment, by showing him how he may avoid or cure the <b>evils</b> his <b>conduct</b> tends to bring upon him. He may be to us an object of pity, perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or resentment; we shall not treat him like an enemy of society: the worst we shall think ourselves justified in doing is leaving him to himself, if we do not interfere benevolently by showing interest or concern for him. It is far otherwise if he has infringed the rules necessary for the protection of his fellow-creatures, individually or collectively. The evil consequences of his acts do not then fall on himself, but on others; and society, as the protector of all its members, must retaliate on him; must inflict pain on him for the express purpose of punishment, and must take care that it be sufficiently severe. In the one case, he is an offender at our bar, and we are called on not only to sit in judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to execute our own sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict any suffering on him, except what may incidentally follow from our using the same liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to him in his.|$|R
60|$|Into {{this field}} of {{criticism}} it is not, I repeat, our present business minutely to enter. The only question for us, attempting {{to study the}} history of opinion, is what Helvétius meant by his paradoxes, and how they came into his mind. No serious writer, least of all a Frenchman in the eighteenth century, ever sets out with anything but such an intention for good, as is capable of respectable expression. And we ask ourselves what good end Helvétius proposed to himself. Of what was he thinking when he perpetrated so singular a misconstruction of his own meaning as that inversion of beneficence into self-love of which we have spoken? We can only explain it in one way. In {{saying that it is}} impossible to love good for good's sake, Helvétius was thinking of the theologians. Their doctrine that man is predisposed to love evil for <b>evil's</b> sake, removes <b>conduct</b> from the sphere of rational motive, as evinced in the ordinary course of human experience. Helvétius met this by contending that both in good and bad conduct men are influenced by their interest and not by mystic and innate predisposition either to good or to evil. He sought to bring morals and human conduct out of the region of arbitrary and superstitious assumption, into the sphere of observation. He thought he was pursuing a scientific, as opposed to a theological spirit, by placing interest at the foundation of conduct, both as matter of fact and of what ought to be the fact, instead of placing there the love of God, or the action of grace, or the authority of the Church.|$|R

A preliminary version of the game, developed in 2013, featured a more action-oriented gameplay, similar to that of Resident Evil 6. Taking inspiration from the 1981 film The Evil Dead, the developers figured scaling back the game to one location and using a first-person perspective to immerse players would {{be the best way to}} return the series to its roots of survival horror.

The decision to make the game first-person was made well before VR was considered; VR development started in October 2015, for which a separate team was created. The introduction of VR demanded that textures be more detailed, discarding flat textures and inaccurate object sizes that had previously been used.

60|$|Among certain nations, the polytheistic theology, thus constituted, {{has become}} {{modified}} by {{the selection of}} some one cosmic or tribal god, as the only god to whom worship is due {{on the part of}} that nation (though {{it is by no means}} denied that other nations have a right to worship other gods), and thus results a worship of one God--monolatry, as Wellhausen calls it--which is very different from genuine monotheism. [27] In ancestral sciotheism, and in this monolatry, the ethical code, often of a very high order, comes into closer relation with the theological creed. Morality is taken under the patronage of the god or gods, who reward all morally good conduct and punish all morally <b>evil</b> <b>conduct</b> in this world or the next. At the same time, however, they are conceived to be thoroughly human, and they visit any shadow of disrespect to themselves, shown by disobedience to their commands, or by delay, or carelessness, in carrying them out, as severely as any breach of the moral laws. Piety means minute attention to the due performance of all sacred rites, and covers any number of lapses in morality, just as cruelty, treachery, murder, and adultery did not bar David's claim to the title of the man after God's own heart among the Israelites; crimes against men may be expiated, but blasphemy against the gods is an unpardonable sin. Men forgive all injuries but those which touch their self-esteem; and they make their gods after their own likeness, in their own image make they them.|$|E

I presume it is only to be ascribed to the intolerable license with which the newspapers break not only the rules of decorum in real life, but even the dramatic decorum, when they personate great men, and, like bad poets, make the heroes of the piece talk more like us Grub-Street scribblers than in a style consonant to persons of gravity and importance in the state. It was easy to demonstrate the cause, and the sole cause, of that rise in the grand article and first necessary of life. It would appear that it had no more connection with the war than the moderate price to which all sorts of grain were reduced, soon after the return of Lord Malmesbury, had with the state of politics and the fate of his Lordship's treaty. I have quite as good reason (that is, no reason at all) to attribute this abundance to the longer continuance of the war as the gentlemen who personate leading members of Parliament have had for giving the enhanced price to that war, at a more early period of its duration.

40|$|This project {{examines}} if and how {{the actions}} of the Catholic Church in relation to the witch trials during the Spanish inquisition can be justified by viewing the actions in relation to theories thought out by Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, John Mill and Lars Svendsen. This project examines how the actions might have been justified during the Spanish inquisition, while the main idea in today’s society might be that the actions were evil and thereby not justifiable. To examine how {{the actions of the}} church might have been justifiable {{at the time of the}} inquisition, the project analyzes the case of the witches of Zugarramurdi. The theories used were all developed in a later historical period compared to the one in which the case took place. Therefore the project is marked by a present perspective, which makes it possible to define the kinds of <b>evil</b> that were <b>conducted</b> by authorities in the city of Zugarramurdi and the region of Navarra, and thereby examine if these actions are compatible with Kant’s categorical imperative and the utilitarian principle. The project concludes that the actions of the church were, and can still be, seen as highly justifiable from an utilitarian perspective, if the church actually believed that the witches represented a diabolical evil. There is a possibility that the actions of the church were made out of fear of losing their seat of power in society, as the church actively tried to suppress anyone whose opinion or way of life differed from that of catholicism, and thusly was not subject to the dominion of christianity. In relation to Kant’s categorical imperative we have analyzed and discussed, if the church considered the witches as rational beings, and thereby if the actions against them could be justified in relation to Kant’s theory...|$|R

60|$|Within {{the figure}} and frame and clothes and cuticle, within {{the bones and}} flesh of many of us, there is but one person,--a man or woman, with a {{preponderance}} either of good or <b>evil,</b> whose <b>conduct</b> in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman. Such persons are simple, single, and, perhaps, generally, safe. They walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles, and are to-day as they were yesterday, and will be to-morrow as they are to-day. Lady Eustace was such a person, and so was Lucy Morris. Opposite in their characters as the two poles, they were, each of them, a simple entity; and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman. But there are human beings who, though of necessity single in body, are dual in character;--in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good,--but to whom evil is sometimes horribly, hideously evil, but is sometimes also not hideous at all. Of such men it may be said that Satan obtains an intermittent grasp, from which, when it is released, the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble. Such men,--or women,--may hardly, perhaps, debase themselves with the more vulgar vices. They will not be rogues, or thieves, or drunkards,--or, perhaps, liars; but ambition, luxury, self-indulgence, pride, and covetousness will {{get a hold of}} them, and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices. Such a man was Frank Greystock, who could walk {{along the banks of the}} quiet, trout-giving Bob, at Bobsborough, whipping the river with his rod, telling himself that the world lost for love would be a bad thing well lost for a fine purpose; and who could also stand, with his hands in his trousers pockets, looking down upon the pavement, in the purlieus of the courts at Westminster, and swear to himself that he would win the game, let the cost to his heart be what it might. What must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling,--some inward ache which he calls a passion and cannot analyse, some desire which has come of instinct and not of judgment,--to interfere with all the projects of his intellect, with all the work which he has laid out for his accomplishment? Circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which, indeed, his means were insufficient, but which he regarded as, of all paths, the noblest and the manliest. If he could be true to himself,--with such truth as at these moments would seem to him to be the truest truth,--there was nothing in rank, nothing in ambition, which might not be within his reach. He might live with the highest, the best-educated, and the most beautiful; he might assist in directing national councils by his intelligence; and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country, and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages. But to do this, he must walk warily. He, an embarrassed man, a man already in debt, a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion, was called upon to live, and to live as though at his ease, among those who had been born to wealth. And, indeed, he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy, that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor.|$|R
