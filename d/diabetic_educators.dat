40|$|Background: Fasting (Sawm) during Ramadan, one of {{the five}} pillars of Islam is {{obligatory}} for all healthy adult and adolescent Muslims from the age of 12 years. Some children with diabetes, despite their exemption insist on fasting in Ramadan. We evaluated the safety of fasting among children with type 1 diabetes. Materials and Mathods: A prospective observational study was designed for diabetic children and adolescents who wish to fast during Ramadan 2012. Patients with their caregivers were given intensive education and instructions were provided by <b>diabetic</b> <b>educators,</b> dieticians and physicians on insulin adjustment, home blood glucose monitoring and dietary adjustments prior to Ramadan. Results: A total of 33 children and adolescents were included in this study. Of these, 16 were male and 17 were female. Majority (60. 6 %) of the patients could complete their fasting during the Ramadan. Patients were divided into two groups, those who completed fasting were considered as Group-I, whereas patients who broke the fast were in Group-ll. Blood glucose, hemoglobin A 1 c weight, and insulin dose before and after Ramadan in two groups showed no significant difference.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether a distanced-based educational in-tervention would result in positive health outcomes for persons with both DM and cognitive im-pairment. Older adults with Type 2 diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus—DM) who also have cognitive im-pairment such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or early stage dementia are both challenged and at risk when attempting to live independently. The ability to effectively monitor blood glucose levels and diet and exercise regimens often is severely constrained by the combination of DM and the presence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or early stage dementia. We describe an explo-ratory study funded by the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in which Certified <b>Diabetic</b> <b>Educators</b> (CDEs) were linked with 40 older adult with DM and cogni-tive impairment using iPads and the internet. CDEs presented personalized education sessions to participants, and 18 of the participants also received a cognitive intervention called Spaced Re-trieval (SR), which is designed to train the effective use of strategies to enhance medication com-pliance and reach other goals.

50|$|Because of {{the complex}} and {{interacting}} factors, it is, in principle, impossible to know for certain how much insulin (and which type) is needed to 'cover' a particular meal to achieve a reasonable blood glucose level within {{an hour or two}} after eating. Non-diabetics' beta cells routinely and automatically manage this by continual glucose level monitoring and insulin release. All such decisions by a diabetic must be based on experience and training (i.e., at the direction of a physician, PA, or in some places a specialist <b>diabetic</b> <b>educator)</b> and, further, specifically based on the individual experience of the patient. But it is not straightforward and should never be done by habit or routine. With some care however, it can be done reasonably well in clinical practice. For example, some patients with diabetes require more insulin after drinking skim milk than they do after taking an equivalent amount of fat, protein, carbohydrate, and fluid in some other form. Their particular reaction to skimmed milk is different from other people with diabetes, but the same amount of whole milk is likely to cause a still different reaction even in that person. Whole milk contains considerable fat while skimmed milk has much less. It is a continual balancing act for all people with diabetes, especially for those taking insulin.|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{education}} is {{a crucial part of}} understanding the basic steps to achieving success in the management of diabetes mellitus. A major responsibility of the nurse is to help patients self-manage their disease. Inpatient admissions present the opportunity to assess the patient???s level of knowledge and need for treatment adjustments. However, nurses frequently have many barriers in the busy hospital environment that can hinder effective diabetic teaching. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the various barriers to teaching that nurses encounter while performing diabetic education in the hospital setting. This was a descriptive, qualitative study that used audio taped interviews and open-ended questions to collect data. The four participants were nurses working on inpatient floors in different hospitals. All interviews were performed in a semi-structured manner. In this study the nurses had very strong opinions on what is needed to be successful when performing diabetic education. Five major barriers emerged affecting a nurse???s ability to successfully perform diabetic education: access to resources, timing, environment, communication and the educational process. Implications from findings include: the need for printed material, continuing education for the nursing staff, the availability of a translator, adequate staffing, a noise reduction program, the availability of a <b>diabetic</b> <b>educator</b> and more time at the bedside to perform teaching. Future research would be beneficial when performed on a larger scale on different units of various hospitals to explore what best practices are occurring and the effects these practices have on nurses and their patients.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} significant and challenging health problems in the United States. Diabetes, if uncontrolled, can lead to degenerative complications such as heart disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Self-care is important in controlling blood glucose levels, preventing complications and promoting health. Many diabetic patients, however, do not participate in self-care practices that lead to compliance with a disease treatment plan. The purpose of this study is to examine differences in compliance with self-care practices and differences in the amount of hemoglobin Alc in the blood of type 2 diabetic patients following a diabetic education program, at the completion of the program, at two months, and at six months. The framework for this study is Dorthea Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory. Self-care involves the actions that individuals initiate to maintain life, health, and well-being. Self-care actions aim to satisfy three types of requisites: universal, developmental, and health deviation requisites. According to Orem, all persons engage in universal self-care requisites including maintenance of air, water, and food, providing elimination, and balancing rest and activity. Diabetic patients experience a health deviation requiring self-care actions to satisfy health deviation requisites including seeking and securing medical assistance, attending to the pathological condition and carrying out therapeutic measures with the goal of controlling underlying pathology and prevention of complications. The sample will include 40 type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in a community diabetic education program at a healthcare institution in the Midwest. The Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale will measure self-care practices at the completion of the program, at two months, and at six months post diabetic education program. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) will also be evaluated at the completion of the diabetic education program, and at two months, and at six months. A simple, interrupted time series design will be used with a repeated measures ANOVA data analysis. Permission will be obtained from Ball State University and the participating institution to conduct the study. The diabetic patients enrolled in the diabetic education program will receive an invitation to participate in the study. A letter explaining the study outline and the voluntary nature of the study will be given to all patients. Responses collected will be confidential and patients will remain anonymous. No risks have been identified. This study is significant in order to assist <b>diabetic</b> <b>educators</b> in identifying diabetic patient needs related to compliance of diabetic self-care practices. Identifying complianceissues will assist <b>diabetic</b> <b>educators</b> in developing diabetic education programs to help diabetic patients improve compliance of self-care practices, which will in turn, maintain or improve hemoglobin Al c blood levels, and decrease or minimize diabetic complications.

40|$|Introduction: In the Chinese community, rapid urbanization, {{sedentary}} life style, stress, {{smoking and}} changes in dietary may {{increase the risk of}} type 2 diabetes. Studies conducted in China showed an increasing prevalence rate from 1. 1 %in 1980 to 4. 56 % in 1996. However, no studies carried on self-management implementation is available in China now. Objectives: To describe the status of self-management implementation among diabetic people in Beijing and to identify possible factors influencing self-caring activities in Chinese context. The purpose was to provide the necessary information for future studies. Methods: This was a cross-section study. It had a descriptive approach. The study combined both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The quantitative method included a questionnaire. The qualitative method included an unstructured interview at respondent’s home and two focus group discussions. Results: The age span of all participants, including both male and female, was 35 - 70 yrs. 17 % respondents had poor self-management of their diabetes. Dietary regimen, physical exercise, adherence to both prescription and self-monitoring were the most difficult activities related to self-management. People in the younger age group had the tendency of poor selfmanagement. Knowledge about diabetes and self-management, good public health insurance and good family care played a positive effect on the self-management implementation, carelessness about diabetes, stress and poor quality of health service offered played a negative effect on self-management. Conclusion: The self-management among type 2 diabetic people in Beijing was poor. Attitude towards diabetes, stress, socio-family care services had effects on self-management. There is a need to focus on advocating healthy life style, keeping on traditional Chinese diet. A professional team, including physician, dietician, <b>diabetic</b> nurse and <b>educator</b> needs to be built.

The debilitating sequelae of diabetes can be limited or prevented altogether through strict glycaemic control. Despite the seemingly uncomplicated nature of the disorder, effective management can be elusive, as the impact of {{having to deal with}} diabetes on a daily basis can be profound and appropriate professional support is not always readily available. As the roles of general practitioners (GPs) and allied health professionals have evolved, a major issue now facing all is that of developing and maintaining effective collaborative relationships for the facilitation of optimal community diabetes care. Using a simple survey methodology, the present exploratory study investigated the referral patterns of GPs to <b>diabetic</b> <b>educators</b> (DEs) working for a community health service in an Australian town, and reasons for referral and non-referral in order to identify factors that contribute to a sound and sustainable collaborative relationship. The results provide some evidence that GPs and DEs in this town do work collaboratively towards achieving client-centred goals and highlight the need to inform GPs who are new to communities, such as this one, of the available DE services. Most importantly, the study identified that there are many opportunities to strengthen collaboration so as to facilitate optimal community diabetes care.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies {{have shown}} that pre-Ramadan {{structured}} educational program for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is beneficial. In this study, {{our aim was to}} evaluate the degree of adherence of treating physicians to such programs and their influence on the patient's knowledge and behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on adult patients with DM attending a university hospital, who were observed while fasting during Ramadan 1436 / 2015. Data was collected using a questionnaire-based interview. Baseline characteristics were obtained, and patients were asked whether they had had pre-Ramadan education or not and who the provider was. Patients' knowledge of the components of the recommended structured pre-Ramadan educational program was also tested. Comparison between patients who had the education {{and those who did not}} was done using Chi-square test and independent samples Student's t-test; p ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients with type 1 or type 2 DM were included in the study; 75. 5 % of the patients were aged 40 years or older. Only 30 % had pre-Ramadan education delivered mainly by <b>diabetic</b> <b>educators</b> or the treating physicians (52 % and 44 %, respectively). Patients who had the education were younger (mean age: 45. 6 ± 17. 4 vs. 50. 3 ± 14. 4, respectively, p = 0. 0048), had higher educational qualifications, were more likely to be employed, and self-monitored their blood glucose more frequently (p = 0. 0001). There was no difference between the two groups with regard to their knowledge of diet and exercise. CONCLUSION: The adherence to the pre-Ramadan educational program by the treating physician was low. It is necessary to increase the awareness about the importance of these programs among health-care professionals.

The complications of diabetic vasculopathy are commonly grouped into microvascular and macrovascular complications. In diabetes, macrovascular complications are the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality and are responsible for a high incidence of vascular diseases. The aim of this review to provide an overview of current treatment modalities for diabetic vasculopathy and highlight the importance of effective control of blood glucose, blood lipids, and blood pressure, as well as reduction of blood hypercoagulability, in lowering the macrovascular complications of diabetic vasculopathy. A literature review was conducted to retrieve the relevant information using the PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases, reports, and books. People with type 2 diabetes are at markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. The initiators of vasculopathy that ultimately develop into long-term diabetic complications can be avoided by a healthy lifestyle and pharmacological intervention. Clinical trials have shown that effective control of blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure, and blood hypercoagulability can reduce macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 {{diabetes is}} responsible for premature mortality, predominantly through atherosclerotic vascular disease. Lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy should be used to prevent or delay development of type 2 diabetes, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

40|$|Background: Globally, the {{magnitude}} of disease burden associated with diabetes is high. Poor glycemic control contributes greatly to this burden, especially in the occurrence of related complications. The value of Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) is evident in literature, and has been recommended {{as a way of}} optimizing glycemic and metabolic control and averting early onset of diabetes complications. Usual care involves spontaneous sharing of information during medical consultations without planned structure or defined time frame. In the African setting, the effect of DSME, and how it compares to usual care, is yet to be fully explored. Objective: To compare the effect of a structured Diabetes Self-Management Education programme to usual care, in type 2 diabetic patients managed at the family medicine clinic, Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN). Methods: This was an open label randomized clinical trial carried out at the outpatient family medicine clinic of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. One hundred and forty type 2 diabetic patients were recruited, 70 patients randomly allocated to either group using a computer generated sequence. DSME was applied in the intervention arm by Certified <b>Diabetic</b> <b>Educators</b> (CDE) while the control group received usual care from the family medicine doctor. The primary outcome, glycated hemoglobin (HBA 1 c) was used to determine the mean difference in blood glucose control after 6 months of follow up. Secondary biomedical outcomes included blood pressure, body weight, height and BMI. Data was analyzed using the per protocol analysis. STATA version 12 software was used. Difference in means of the outcome variables was compared using the student t-test. Results: A total of 96 patients (69 %) completed the study, 55 in the DSME group and 41 in the usual care group. The mean (± SD) age of all the patients at baseline was 48. 8 (± 9. 8) years with a mean (± SD) HBA 1 c of 9. 9 % (± 1. 76). After 6 months of follow up, no significant difference was noted in the primary outcome (HBA 1 c) between both groups, with a mean difference of 0. 37 (95 % CI - 0. 45 to 1. 19; P = 0. 37). DSME also made no remarkable change in any of the secondary outcome measures. Conclusion: Overall, DSME did not show significant improvements in the primary or secondary biomedical outcomes. This may suggest that a well-trained family physician offering diabetes education may be just as good as a DSME trained educator. Further studies are however required to support this finding, particularly in primary care settings within the African context...|$|E
