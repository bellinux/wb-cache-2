25|$|Twist lifts are {{a form of}} pair lifts, {{where the}} lifted partner is thrown into the air, twists, and is caught by the lifted partner. The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; she crossed <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm awful tired. It's awful cold. My feet hurt awfully. Carl dear, oh, pleassssse {{take me home}} now. I want my mamma. Maybe she won't whip me now. It's so dark and--ohhhhhh----" [...] She muttered, incoherently: [...] "There! By the road! He's {{waiting for}} us!" [...] She sank down, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, groaning, [...] "Don't hurt me!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{tightened}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom, and she laughed to herself--a hard, harsh, angry laugh.|$|R

6000|$|She {{laid her}} cigar aside like Amelius, and crossed <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom, {{and looked at}} him, with the first {{softening}} gleam of tenderness {{that he had seen}} in her face. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "yours will be a sad life--I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours; the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days, perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have something to show you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The superb {{success of}} this last {{offering}} excited Teddy to such a degree, that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and before it had time even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre. Of course {{she did not like}} it, and expressed her anguish and resentment in a way that terrified her infant destroyer. Being covered with kid, she did not blaze, but did what was worse, she squirmed. First one leg curled up, then the other, in a very awful and lifelike manner; next she flung <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head as if in great agony; her head itself turned on her shoulders, her glass eyes fell out, and with one final writhe of her whole body, she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins of the town. This unexpected demonstration startled every one and frightened Teddy half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed and fled toward the house, roaring [...] "Marmar" [...] {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|E
5000|$|In some twists, {{the lady}} {{performs}} a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° {{from the body}} axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] Other variations which may increase the score include steps or other skating moves going into the twist, delayed rotation, or the lady holding <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E

According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility crosses <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> chest.|$|E

5000|$|Dec {{found it}} very {{frustrating}} when the callers could not get the answer right (while sometimes also submitting guesses that didn't rhyme), and would sometimes throw the toy and the stand it was placed on in (mock) anger, or ranting into the camera, which became a staple occurrence and sparked his catchphrase for the game, [...] "It's Gotta Rhyme!". The hosts' continued frustration led to them filming a pre-recorded round of the game, with an answer of [...] "Pat Cat" [...] (the clue being host Cat Deeley rubbing <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> back). The fictional contestant {{made a number of}} unrelated guesses, including constantly repeating [...] "Feely Deeley" [...] even when informed it was incorrect numerous times.|$|E

5000|$|A twist lift, {{an element}} {{found only in}} pair skating, is a move that begins with the man {{assisting}} the lady in an Axel or toe-assisted jump where she rotates and is caught mid-air by the man, who then places her down back on the ice. In some twists, the lady performs a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° from the body axis and her legs are straight or almost straight." [...] A few pairs perform a nearly 180° degree split before rotating. A pair may also achieve a higher score with a difficult entrance, delayed rotation, or if the lady holds <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head while rotating.|$|E
5000|$|Maekawa {{is another}} of Makoto's classmates who is very tall for a girl (she claims to be 179.9 cm tall) and always refers to Makoto as 'transfer student' as she can never get his name right. She later says that its kind of {{embarrassing}} for her {{to change the way}} she addresses Makoto(It is hinted that she has feelings for Makoto). She is very calm and sometimes expressionless perhaps due to having a weak body and sometimes amuses herself by teasing Ryūko. She gets dizzy if she raises <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head for more than ten seconds, and often wears various costumes. Her parents own a bar in the shopping district and she has several part-time jobs. She insists on wearing cosplay to work even when her supervisor insists her not to.|$|E
40|$|Our Lady of Guadalupe Of {{course it}} would be to you—you, dark-haired, you, an image of you on the forearm of a girl that I loved for a second or three, some time between the nights by the ice {{counting}} rotations and the time the girl called me from the house of a woman she met while jailed. She would talk to higher men in exchange for a sheet to pull over <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders for a few nights. Of course we did not count the rotations. Of course she ignored you on her arm despite my constant touching of the raised skin on nights during those seconds or three, despite you making the most sense out of all of this: about a woman, about nothing mystical, about nothing mythical.

60|$|Sentimentally she did {{not much}} care to see him--his delays had wearied her, but it was necessary; and with a sigh she {{arranged}} herself picturesquely in the chair; first this way, then that; next so that the light fell <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head. Next she flung herself {{on the couch in}} the cyma-recta curve which so became <b>her,</b> and with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow looked towards the door. This, she decided, was the best position after all, and thus she remained till a man's step was heard on the stairs. Whereupon Lucetta, forgetting her curve (for Nature was too strong for Art as yet), jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the window-curtains in a freak of timidity. In spite of the waning of passion the situation was an agitating one--she had not seen Henchard since his (supposed) temporary parting from her in Jersey.|$|R
60|$|The maid {{opened the}} door. Mr. Vimpany's heavy hand laid bold of <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> pulled <b>her</b> <b>over</b> the threshold, {{and closed the}} door behind her. After a brief absence, Fanny {{returned}} with news of my lord.|$|R
5000|$|Milly Santiago {{inserted}} {{herself in}} the middle of a controversy involving the 2016 World Series featuring the Chicago Cubs vs the Cleveland Indians. The Cubs franchise offered Chicago aldermen the option of purchasing tickets at face value. However, the Board of Ethics determine this to be a gift over $50 due to the secondary market markup on the tickets. Santiago and some of her peers believed that they should be exempt from this because they are too poor to purchase tickets on the secondary market. As an alderman, Santiago makes roughly $116,000 a year. Santiago is quoted as saying [...] "First of all, those tickets were not front-row tickets. They were all the way in the upper-deck. If I went like this, I would almost touch the ceiling. That’s how bad those tickets were," [...] Santiago said, lifting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head. Ald. Milly Santiago (31st) said she is [...] "a poor alderman" [...] who can’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for Cubs tickets purchased on the secondary market according to the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|R

She can understand but little of it: but she loves to hear it, for it reminds her of Tom Thurnall. Above all she loves {{to hear about the}} microscope, a mystery inseparable in her thoughts from him who first showed her its wonders.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Office fansite [...] "OfficeTally", Celotta said she and Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors, so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities. Once the scripts were circulated, the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was {{not very good at}} volleyball and had trouble making certain motions with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head due to a previous injury. As a result, director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer-generated imagery. The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post-credits scene was used {{in order to keep the}} episode within the network-mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds. The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons, like [...] "The Job" [...] and [...] "Goodbye, Toby", but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in [...] "Company Picnic" [...] and would have had trouble filling a full hour.|$|R

6000|$|She stopped breathlessly, {{stared at}} his face with her former {{intensity}} as if she would pluck the thought that followed from his brain. But he only moved closer to <b>her,</b> passed his <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders with a movement so natural and protecting {{that it had a}} certain dignity in it, and, looking down upon her bent head with eyes brimming with sympathy, whispered, [...] "Poor, poor child!" ...|$|R
60|$|Never shall I {{forget the}} look of horror which came in Mme. la Marquise's eyes {{when she saw me}} {{entering}} our miserable attic {{in the company of a}} stranger. The last of the little bit of tallow candle flickered in its socket. Madame threw <b>her</b> emaciated <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> child, just like some poor hunted animal defending its young. I could almost hear the cry of terror which died down in her throat ere it reached her lips. But then, monsieur, to see the light of hope gradually illuminating her pale, wan face as the stranger took her hand and spoke to her--oh! so gently and so kindly--was a sight which filled my poor, half-broken heart with joy.|$|R
50|$|The Crouching Venus is a Hellenistic {{model of}} Venus {{surprised}} at her bath. Venus crouches {{with her right}} knee close to the ground, turns {{her head to the}} right and, in most versions, reaches <b>her</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>over</b> to <b>her</b> left shoulder to cover her breasts. To judge by the number of copies that have been excavated on Roman sites in Italy and France, this variant on Venus seems to have been popular.|$|R
5000|$|On December 18, 2004, Fox was aboard United Airlines Flight 56 from Honolulu to Los Angeles. During the flight, Fox {{was seated}} next to an Asian female passenger. The woman later told {{investigators}} with the FBI that she had taken Dramamine {{because she wanted to}} rest and fell asleep holding a folded airline blanket on <b>her</b> lap, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> crossed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> blanket. Fox testified during his trial that after he placed his arm on the arm rest, the sleeping woman did not move <b>her</b> own <b>arm</b> from the arm rest. Later, he pressed his leg against hers. Fox claimed that he believed that because the sleeping woman did not move away, she was [...] "giving him a nonverbal clue that she was sexually interested." ...|$|R
60|$|While Mrs. Blyth was {{thinking}} about her father, Madonna signalized the advent of two more visitors. First, she raised her hand sharply, and began pulling at an imaginary whisker on her own smooth cheek--then stood bolt upright, and folded <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> majestically <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bosom. Mrs. Blyth immediately recognized the originals of these two pantomime portrait-sketches. The one represented Mr. Hemlock, the small critic of a small newspaper, who was principally remarkable for never letting his whiskers alone for five minutes together. The other portrayed Mr. Bullivant, the aspiring fair-haired sculptor, who wrote poetry, and studied dignity in his attitudes so unremittingly, {{that he could not}} even stop to look in at a shop-window, without standing before it as if he was his own statue.|$|R

6000|$|But <b>her</b> martyrdom was <b>over</b> at last. The {{minister}} {{appeared in}} the pulpit and Peg subsided into silence. She folded <b>her</b> bare, floury <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast and fastened her black eyes on the young preacher. Her behaviour for the next half-hour was decorum itself, save that when the minister prayed that we might all be charitable in judgment Peg ejaculated [...] "Amen" [...] several times, loudly and forcibly, somewhat to the discomfiture of the Young man, to whom Peg was a stranger. He opened his eyes, glanced at our pew in a startled way, then collected himself and went on.|$|R
6000|$|Such was {{the happy}} reign of Wouter Van Twiller, celebrated in many a long {{forgotten}} song {{as the real}} golden age, the rest being nothing but counterfeit copper-washed coin. In that delightful period a sweet and holy calm reigned over the whole province. The burgomaster smoked his pipe in peace; the substantial solace of his domestic cares, after her daily toils were done, sat soberly at the door, with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> crossed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> apron of snowy white without being insulted by ribald street walkers or vagabond boys--those unlucky urchins who do so infest our streets, displaying under the roses of youth the thorns and briars of iniquity. Then {{it was that the}} lover with ten breeches, and the damsel with petticoats of half a score, indulged in all the innocent endearments of virtuous love without fear and without reproach; for what had that virtue to fear which was defended by a shield of good linsey-woolsey, equal at least to the seven bull-hides of the invincible Ajax? ...|$|R
