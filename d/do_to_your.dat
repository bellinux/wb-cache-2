500|$|The First Lady {{launched}} the [...] "Just Say No" [...] drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as first lady. Reagan first {{became aware of}} the need to educate young people about drugs during a 1980 campaign stop in Daytop village, New York. She remarked in 1981 that [...] "Understanding what drugs can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> children, understanding peer pressure and understanding why they turn to drugs is... the first step in solving the problem." [...] Her campaign focused on drug education and informing the youth of the danger of drug abuse.|$|E
500|$|Trademarks and {{characteristics}} that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms, polymetered riff cycles, rhythmic syncopation, rapid key and tempo changes and neo-jazz chromatics. Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter {{if something is}} hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> mind {{when you listen to}} it? Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E
2500|$|He is {{popularly known}} {{as the author of}} two sayings: [...] (1) [...] "If I am not for myself who is for me? And being for my own self, what am 'I'? And if not now, when?" [...] and (2) the {{expression}} of the ethic of reciprocity, or [...] "Golden Rule": [...] "That which is hateful to you, do not <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{comparative}} {{response to}} the challenge of a Gentile who asked that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot, illustrates the character differences between Shammai and Hillel. Shammai dismissed the man. Hillel accepted the question but gently chastised the man:"What is hateful to you, do not <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> fellow: this is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn" [...] Hillel recognized brotherly love, also known as [...] "the Golden Rule", as the fundamental principle of Jewish moral law. (Lev. xix. 18).|$|E
2500|$|Hillel the Elder [...] {{formulated}} {{a version}} of the Golden rule: [...] "What is hateful to you, do not do unto others." [...] (Talmud, tracate Shabbat 31a; Midrash Avot de Rabbi Natan.) [...] Rabbi Akiva, a 1st-century CE rabbi, [...] states [...] "Whatever you hate to have done unto you, do not <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> neighbor; wherefore do not hurt him; do not speak ill of him; do not reveal his secrets to others; let his honor and his property be as dear to thee as thine own" [...] (Midrash Avot deRabbi Natan.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's not it, father! I heard Deerslayer say how it was. You must <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> enemies as {{you wish}} your enemies would do to you. No man wishes his enemies to kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] said Randolph. [...] "Give up the property, the title, {{the family}} honor, the wrong <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> reputation, the punishment"--He hesitated, fearing {{he had gone}} too far.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now write--write as you'll {{remember}} what Wakem's <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> father, and you'll make {{him and his}} feel it, if ever the day comes. And sign your name Thomas Tulliver." ...|$|R

60|$|Having thus shewed {{you that}} there is such a thing as a reprobation, I come now to shew you what it is.

6000|$|... "I little {{know how}} you got into this fix, but I mean to find out," [...] said Marilla. [...] "Come {{right down to the}} kitchen--it's too cold up here--and tell me just what you've done. I've been expecting {{something}} queer for some time. You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due. Now, then, what did you <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> hair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{look a bit}} natural. What {{have you}} been <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> {{precious}} little self?" [...] persisted Fanny, troubled by the change, yet finding it hard to say wherein it lay.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{we are to}} be in that {{position}} it will be entirely your own doing, Tertius," [...] said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest conviction. [...] "You will not behave as you ought to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own family. You offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we were at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him and told him your affairs, he would do anything for you.

6000|$|... "Lord Ardrahan {{is not one}} of them. And Sir Jasper Lynch, and Blake of Letterkenny, {{they are}} all there, if you will speak to them. In such a matter as this it is not worth your while to get into serious trouble.

6000|$|She {{began the}} letter. [...] "My dearest Blanche, I have seen Sir Patrick, {{and he has}} given me your message. I will set your mind at ease about {{me as soon as}} I can.

[...] She stopped--the paper swam before her eyes. [...] "My own darling!" [...] she thought, [...] "who could have foreseen that I should ever shrink from the thought of seeing you?" [...] She sighed, and dipped the pen in the ink, and went on with the letter.|$|E
6000|$|She {{went into}} the kitchen, {{disposed}} of her purchases, and returned with the right cups. [...] "What you <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> face, Elfrid?" [...] she asked, and came and scrutinised his scratches. [...] "All rough it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{know how}} you'll {{reconcile}} {{what you are}} <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> conscience. What right can you have to throw away the girl's chance, now {{that she has a}} chance? What fortune can you give her?" ...|$|R

60|$|What the gilt notes suggest, what {{imitative}} parallel may {{be found}} to them in that chaos that is termed Nature, {{is a matter of}} no importance. They may suggest, as they do sometimes to me, peacocks and pomegranates and splashing fountains of gold water, or, as they <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> critic, sponges and Indian clubs and chimney-pot hats. Such suggestions and evocations have nothing whatsoever to do with the aesthetic quality and value of the design. A thing in Nature becomes much lovelier if it reminds us of a thing in Art, but a thing in Art gains no real beauty through reminding us of a thing in Nature. The primary aesthetic impression of a work of art borrows nothing from recognition or resemblance. These belong to a later and less perfect stage of apprehension.|$|E
6000|$|The {{official}} eye is more eloquent {{than the}} official lips and asks almost urgently, [...] "What in this immeasurable universe have {{you managed to}} <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> thumbs? And why?" [...] But he is only a very inferior sort of official indeed, a mere clerk of the post, and {{he has all the}} guarded reserve of your thoroughly unoriginal man. [...] "You are not the two persons I ascertained you were," [...] he says, with the note of one resigned to communion with unreason; [...] "because you"--he indicates me--"are evidently at your residence in London." [...] I smile. [...] "That gentleman"--he points a pen at the botanist {{in a manner that is}} intended to dismiss my smile once for all--"will be in London next week. He will be returning next Friday from a special mission to investigate the fungoid parasites that have been attacking the cinchona trees in Ceylon." ...|$|E
6000|$|How one {{loves to}} see the burly figure of him, this thick-skinned, {{seemingly}} opaque, perhaps sulky, almost stupid Man of Practice, pitted against some light adroit Man of Theory, all equipt with clear logic, and able anywhere to give you Why for Wherefore! The adroit Man of Theory, so light of movement, clear of utterance, with his bow full-bent and quiver full of arrow-arguments,--surely he will strike down the game, transfix everywhere {{the heart of the}} matter; triumph everywhere, as he proves that he shall and must <b>do?</b> <b>To</b> <b>your</b> astonishment, it turns out oftenest No. The cloudy-browed, thick-soled, opaque Practicality, with no logic utterance, in silence mainly, with here and there a low grunt or growl, has in him what transcends all logic-utterance: a Congruity with the Unuttered. The Speakable, which lies atop, as a superficial film, or outer skin, is his or is not his: but the Doable, which reaches down to the World's centre, you find him there! ...|$|E

Ah, sir, that little helpless baby is a grown-up girl now; of an age to inspire love, and to feel love. I blush to acknowledge it; I have behaved with a want of self-control, with a cowardly weakness.--No! I am, indeed, wandering this time. I ought to have told you first that I have been brought {{face to face with the}} possibility of Eunice's marriage. And, to make it worse still, I can't help liking the young man. He comes of a good family--excellent manners, highly educated, plenty of money, a gentleman in every sense of the word. And poor little Eunice is so fond of him! Isn't it dreadful to be obliged to check her dearly-loved Philip? The young gentleman's name is Philip. Do you like the name? I say I am obliged to cheek her sweetheart in the rudest manner, when all he wants to do is to ask me modestly for my sweet Eunice's hand. Oh, what have I not suffered, without a word of sympathy to comfort me, before I had courage enough to write to you! Shall I make a dreadful confession? If my religious convictions had not stood in my way, I believe I should have committed suicide. Put yourself in my place. Try to see yourself shrinking from a necessary explanation, when the happiness of a harmless girl--so dutiful, so affectionate--depended on a word of kindness from your lips. And that word you are afraid to speak! Don't take offense, sir; I mean myself, not you. Why don't you say something?"
