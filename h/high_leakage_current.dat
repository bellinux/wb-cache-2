30|$|To {{achieve a}} high {{capacitance}} density for embedded decoupling capacitor applications, the aerosol deposition (AD) process was applied as {{a thin film}} deposition process. BaTiO 3 films were fabricated on Cu substrates by the AD process at room temperature, and the film thickness was reduced to confirm the limit of the critical minimum thickness for dielectric properties. As a result, the BaTiO 3 thin films that were less than 1 -μm thick showed unstable electric properties owing to their <b>high</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> Therefore, to overcome this problem, {{the causes of the}} <b>high</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> were investigated.

Consequently, we proposed that the chinks and weak particle-to-particle bonding in the BaTiO 3 thin films with thicknesses of less than 0.5 μm on Cu substrates could be the main cause of the <b>high</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
