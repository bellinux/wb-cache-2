5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to <b>excite</b> an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal.

In this work, the currently existing {{version of the}} SA-REKS method, which included only one <b>excited</b> state into the ensemble averaging, is extended by adding more <b>excited</b> states to the averaged energy functional. A general strategy for extension of the REKS-type methods to larger ensembles of ground and <b>excited</b> states is outlined and implemented in extended versions of the SA-REKS and SI-SA-REKS methods. The newly developed methods are tested in the calculation of several <b>excited</b> states of ground-state multi-reference systems, such as dissociating hydrogen molecule, and <b>excited</b> states of donor-acceptor molecular systems. For hydrogen molecule, the new method correctly reproduces the distance dependence of the lowest <b>excited</b> state energies and describes an avoided crossing between the doubly <b>excited</b> and singly <b>excited</b> states. For bithiophene-perylenediimide stacked complex, the SI-SA-REKS method correctly describes crossing between the locally <b>excited</b> state and the charge transfer <b>excited</b> state and yields vertical excitation energies in good agreement with the ab initio wavefunction methods.

5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities.

Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to <b>excite</b> room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses.

A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E

As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania.
