Previous {{studies on the}} biological activity {{of this kind of}} compounds are also mentioned. Our studies on the photooxidation of aromatic resin acids show that all the compounds have a podocarpane skeleton oxygenated at C- 2, C- 6, C- 12 and C- 1 "', the unusual functionalization at C- 2 in ring A is worthy of notice. The high yield and selectivity achieved in the photooxygenation of 13 -de alkylated derivates, mainly with A/B junction cis, point towards the practical interest of this reaction especially in view of the biological activity shown by these compounds. The formation of dimers with C_ 7 -C_ 7, junction during the photooxidation process under low oxygen concentration is also reported, and found to be strongly dependent on the stereochemistry of the A/B rings junction.

40|$|Non-covalent {{interactions}} influence supramolecular {{organization in}} the solid, solution and gaseous state. While intermolecular forces are well understood individually, {{it is difficult to}} predict how their interplay will lead to a highly symmetric and low energy crystalline solid. Analysis, design, and prediction of crystalline architecture is a recently popularized sub-field of supramolecular chemistry referred to as 'crystal engineering'. Crystal engineering seeks to fully understand non-bonding intermolecular forces in order to build crystalline solids that serve some designed purpose. Hydrogen bonds are strong and directional intermolecular forces used to build crystalline solids with desirable supramolecular topography. Much focus has been placed on cyclic diamides, such as <b>diureas</b> and dioxamides, as robust structural motifs due to their propensity to form highly rigid hydrogen bonded structures. The diketopiperazine is an exceptional cyclic diamide synthon due to its planar, inflexible, ring structure and predictable solid state organization. Professor E. A. Mash has studied the indane diketopiperazine designed such that hydrogen bonding occurs along one principal axis, while two orthogonal and linearly independent non-covalent interactions occur 90 ° offset from each other. Substitution changes to the indane ring system can explore a range of non-bonding interactions influencing self-recognition. Several different 1, 4 -alkyloxy indane 2, 5 -diketopiperazines were synthesized and studied. The 1, 4 -dodecyloxy and 1, 4 -octadecyloxy diketopiperazines are liquid crystalline as observed by differential scanning calorimetry and optical microscopy. The 1, 4 -dodecyloxy diketopiperazine crystal structure, while exhibiting much alkyl chain disorder, indicated the supramolecular construct remained constant throughout the 1, 4 -alkyloxy indane diketopiperazine series. In order to better understand non-bonding associations of the indane diketopiperazines in the solid, solution and gas phase, an N-methylated 1, 4 -methyloxy 2, 5 -diketopiperazine was synthesized and studied by X-ray crystallography, ESI mass spectrometry, and by UV-VIS and NMR spectroscopy. While the solid state N-Me diketopiperazine is polymorphic, existing as hydrogen bonded dimer and polymer, the gas and solution phase experiments indicated predominant dimeric associations. 1, 4 -Dialkyloxy indane bis-diketopiperazines were envisioned as the next generation of robust indane targets, and their synthesis required construction of novel unnatural bis-amino esters.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} film {{formation}} and friction in grease lubricated, rolling-sliding, non-conformal contacts over {{a range of}} entrainment speeds, surface roughnesses and contact temperatures. The effects of grease composition are assessed by employing custom made, additive free, lithium and <b>diurea</b> thickened greases, whose composition is systematically varied so {{that the effects of}} the thickener and the base oil can be isolated. All film thickness and friction measurements were conducted under fully-flooded conditions. It was found that at low speeds all tested greases are able to form thicker films than the corresponding base oils. The thickness and behaviour of these films is determined by the thickener type and is independent of the base oil viscosity and the test temperature. At higher speeds, the film thickness is governed by the base oil properties alone and can be predicted by the EHD theory. At low speeds, films with <b>diurea</b> greases grow with time under constant speed and residual films persist under load after contact motion ceases. The real lambda ratio, based on measured grease film thickness, was shown to correlate well with contact friction. The transition from the thickener dominated behaviour to that dominated by the base oil occurs at a relatively constant film thickness, regardless of the base oil viscosity and test temperatures, rather than at a given entrainment speed. Based on the presented evidence, it is here proposed that the mechanism of formation of grease films at low speeds, is analogous to that reported to operate in EHL contacts lubricated with colloidal dispersions, namely the mechanical entrapment and deposition of thickener fibres, and that, rather than the widely quoted ???transition speed???, it is the ratio of the thickener fibre size to prevailing film thickness that determines the range of conditions under which the film enhancement due to the action of thickener is present...|$|E

30|$|An {{increasing}} concentration of ambient ozone was observed during recent decades in many industrial and rural {{regions of the}} world and poses a hazard for vegetation. The ozone exposure of plants causes extensive visible leaf damage and decreased rates of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis (Pell et al. 1997; Torsethaugen et al. 1997; Zheng et al. 2000; Sanmartin et al. 2003). Ozone entered through stomata reacts with apoplastic and symplastic components of the cell (Long and Naidu 2002; Castagna and Ranieri 2009; Cho et al. 2011) resulting in a greater accumulation of ROS, which causes an oxidative damage to the photosynthetic membranes and finally leads to the death of photosynthetic mesophyll cells (Godde and Buchhold 1992; Ciompi et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2005). It was suggested that ozone exposure directly affects guard cells by inhibiting the ion channels (K+ 1 channel) activity in the guard cell plasma membrane (Torsethaugen et al. 1999). Protection of crop plants from ozone damage could be accomplished by replacement of sensitive biotypes with more tolerant ones as well as by application of synthetic ozone protectants such as ethylene <b>diurea,</b> azoxystrobin, epoxiconazole and penconazole (Blum et al. 2011; Didyk and Blum 2011). However, application of synthetic ozone protectants will pollute the environment and may affect the crop production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative ecofriendly strategies to minimize the ozone damage in plants by using plant-based natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid.|$|E

Fertiliser was applied at equivalent to 200 kg N/ha and the cores were leached with 5 cm of distilled water per week. AS, AN and CAN exhibited similar, rapid leaching rates with over 90 % of the applied N passing through the cores in 10 weeks: 50 % of the N applied as NH 4 -N passed through in this form while the remainder was nitrified and passed through as N 03 -N. Urea and DAP showed a slower initial leaching, but this increased as nitrification peaked at 7 weeks. After 16 weeks about 70 % of the N applied in urea and DAP had passed through the cores with about 70 % of this as N 03 -N. The two slow-release fertilisers, SCU and IBDU showed steady leaching patterns, identical to each other. About 50 % of their N was leached over the 16 week period, nearly all as N 03 -N.

Urea was applied four times per year with either a spring application or a late-fall application combined with applications in early June, mid-July, and early September (171 – 196 kg N ha– 1 yr– 1). For IBDU and SCU, application dates and N rates (kg ha– 1) consisted of June 98 + September 98, June 98 + November 98, and June 49 + September 49 + November 74. The turfs were rated for color for 3 yr, and clipping weights were determined weekly for the final 2 yr of the study. Results were generally similar for both cultivars, except fewer significant differences in spring color ratings were found on Newport. An application of urea in November, without a subsequent spring fertilization, resulted in higher turf color ratings in the early spring but lower turf color ratings in May and June, compared to turf receiving a spring fertilization. Results indicate that a late-fall application of urea may not eliminate the need for spring fertilization but may allow a reduction in the amount of N applied in spring. Turfs fertilized with SCU in November received higher color ratings in the spring than did turf fertilized with SCU in September.

Field studies showed that the appearance of dead spot infection centers was influenced predominantly by air ({{greater than or equal to}} 18 degrees Centigrade) and soil (greater than or equal to 20 degrees Centigrade) temperature, but other factors including low relative humidity (less than or equal to 80 %), shortened periods of leaf wetness (less than or equal to 14 hours), and high levels of solar radiation (greater than or equal to 230 W m to the minus 2) were associated with the development of dead spot epidemics. Patch diameter of O. agrostis infection centers and pseudothecia production generally increased at a linear rate between mid-June and early to mid-August. In a growth chamber study, ascospores were released from pseudothecia following a sharp decrease in relative humidity. Field studies revealed that ascospore release occurred primarily at dawn and dusk or during precipitation events. During precipitation events, ascospores may be forcefully discharged during the entire event, but most ascospores are released within the first 10 hours after precipitation begins. O. agrostis successfully over-wintered in bentgrass leaf sheaths, crowns, roots, and stolons, but little or no reactivation of the disease occurred in the second year.

40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the optimal {{conditions}} for composting and factors influencing microbiological changes during the Composting of Eucalyptus bark in the production of a plant growth medium. A bench-scale composter was designed to provide strict control over air composition, moisture content, temperature and mixing. The composter consisted of six 4 -L capacity gas-tight units of PVC plastic, each of which was provided with a mixing paddle coupled to a common drive. A natural temperature rise was simulated by having the units immersed in a water bath, with the temperature increased at rates consistent with those observed in large-scale compost heaps. This provided a companitively inexpensive versatile system, with rates of CO 2 and CH 4 production and 02 consumption automatically monitored by gas chromatography. Levels of volatilized NH 3 and nitrogen oxides (NO.) were manually monitored from acid traps. The reproducibility of the system was as good as the best reported. Optimal conditions for the bench-scale composting of eucalypt bark were considered to be a temperature of 55 0, on aeration rate of at least 20 mL min - 1 and an initial C:N ratio of 25 - 30, depending on the availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen, in decreasing order of availability, was provided in the form of urea, isobutylidene <b>diurea</b> (IBDU), fish wastes or sewage cake. Both respiratory activity and nitrogen loss data were considered to be of value in determining the economic as well as the microbiological optimal C:N ratio of bark compost. No further amendment other than water (giving an initial moisture content of 1147. d. w. basis) was found to be necessary. Ammonification and NH 3 volatilization occurred during the first sixteen days of composting while volatilization of NO was substantial during times of undesirable nitrogen availability. Delaying ammonification in the urea amended composts (by either the addition of quinone or urea's replacement with IBDU) increased ammonia volatilization. Net nitrification followed peak net ammonification, but nitrate appeared to be produced largely chemically rather than biologically. Volatilization of NO. was greatest from compost prepared using sewage cake. Up to five peaks of CO 2 output were observed over a 30 day run, three occurring during the transition to thermophilic conditions and one or two peaks occurring during a plateau temperature of 55 0. The predominant flora comprised Bacillus spp. during the mesophilic and early thermophilic phases (B. brevis and B. sphaericus followed by B. circulans and B. brevis then B. circulans, B. sphaericus or B. stearothersophilus). Bacillus spp. continued to predominate throughout the composting of sewage-bark and most of the fish-bark composts. However, actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp. and Thernomonospora spp.) and coryneforms predominated at latter stages of urea-bark composts. Strictly anaerobic bacteria appeared to be unimportant during the composting of bark. The predominant flora isolated during the mesophilic phase were not inhibited by compost components of any age, while members of the climax flora were inhibited by fresh compost components. Cellulase activity was not correlated with peaks in CO 2 output, but showed a slow increase or decrease, depending on the initial C:N ratio, over 30 days composting. However, lipase activity correlated with the peak in CO 2 output at about day sixteen in a fish-bark compost. The identification of thermophilic Bacillus spp. was aided by a study of their esterase mobilities and the use of numerical taxonomy. Phenolic compounds present after 30 days composting were phytotoxic. However, levels of residual ammonium could largely account for the phytotoxicity exhibited by water extracts from most of these composts. Eucalypt bark composts had a higher density than pine-bark composts or peat moss, but were as good as or better than the latter materials with regard to their water characteristics and particle-size distribution...|$|E
