5|$|Finally, Tracy <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> become {{entangled}} in a character assassination plot. When Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) tells Tracy that he {{read in a}} magazine that Bill Cosby hates him, Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders, a cabal of powerful African Americans (a reference to the 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off his Comedy Central show), are out to destroy his career. The Black Crusaders have managed {{to put a stop}} to all productions featuring Tracy. Fearing for his life, Tracy goes on the run to Cleveland and, from there, into Needmore, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day, Russell wins the toss and elects to bat, giving the British {{officers}} a strong start. Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match {{only to find}} that Kachra <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> lost his ability to spin the ball — new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones (which the team have been practising with). In addition, as part of his agreement with Russell, Lakha deliberately drops many catches. Later that evening, Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother. She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha's deception. Rather than allow the villagers to kill him, Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself.|$|E

5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, an ex-student of Scully's (Kate Twa) asks the agents to help her with her first {{investigation}} concerning a number of disappearances with very few clues. Mulder ponders the idea of spontaneous human combustion but rethinks it when they find a man, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub), who is afraid of his own shadow. Banton is a scientist researching dark matter, and his shadow <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> developed the ability to disintegrate people who come across it.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man and Bass begin a final {{confrontation}} with Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands {{to know why}} he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. It was then Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Bass doesn't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes {{for them to be}} friends if they were to meet in the future.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused {{about what is going}} on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E
5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up {{to her in the}} Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear before her eyes. As it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E
25|$|If Risky Corp {{does indeed}} default after, say, one year, then the hedge fund will have paid $500,000 to AAA-Bank, but then {{receives}} $10million (assuming zero recovery rate, and that AAA-Bank has the liquidity {{to cover the}} loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5million loss minus recovery unless the bank <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> offset the position before the default.|$|E

25|$|Barks, {{with a note}} of {{skepticism}} often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> gotten {{under the influence of}} a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a parody of Bela Lugosi's White Zombie, the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality.|$|E
25|$|Upon returning, the {{passengers}} discover that {{what seemed like}} many hours took {{no time at all}} from Earth's perspective. They also find that all of their video footage has been erased, presumably by magnetic fields in the wormholes. After seeing that Hadden is apparently dead and that the transmission <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> been stopped without a 26 year delay, government officials accuse the travellers of an international conspiracy. They blackmail Ellie and her fellow travellers into silence until more evidence can be found. Palmer Joss becomes {{one of the few people}} willing to believe her story that she can only justify on faith.|$|E
25|$|An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela {{places her}} son and {{daughter}} with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. Encolpius reveals that he <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth {{he claims to have}} has not appeared, the patience of the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body. In the final passage preserved, historical examples of cannibalism are cited (141).|$|E

25|$|After Goro's {{defeat at}} the hands of {{eventual}} champion Liu Kang, all hell breaks loose on the island, and Scorpion, one of only seven tournament survivors, teams up with Sub-Zero and the thunder god Raiden in holding back Shang Tsung's army, then kills Sub-Zero and disappears. In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Scorpion learns that Sub-Zero <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> returned, and plans to compete in the second tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao Kahn. He tracks his nemesis down but notices, in the process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in battle. Scorpion realizes {{that this is not the}} original Sub-Zero but instead his younger brother, who was sent to complete the elder Sub-Zero's failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, Scorpion vows to serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.|$|E
25|$|Terminator Salvation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} of the Terminator film series, and was made by The Halcyon Company and again distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Columbia Pictures with an original release on May 21, 2009 to mixed reviews and which grossed $371.4 million. It was written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris and directed by McG, and stars Christian Bale as John Connor. Following the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, after Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader of humanity to which he is destined. In this future, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, who was personally recommended by James Cameron) <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> altered it, and the T-101 (Roland Kickinger with CG-rendered facial likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger) is coming online sooner than expected. The film also involves Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and how he became the man {{he was in the}} first film. The film also stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Common and Helena Bonham Carter.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Tom and April {{continue}} {{to make fun of}} Leslie, much to the displeasure of Mark. Mark, who tells the documentary crew he is impressed that Leslie <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> maintained her optimism about government for six years, secretly asks Ron to give her the park project. Mark said doing so would return a favor Ron owes him for unspecified reasons. Leslie and Ann are extremely excited about the new exploratory subcommittee, and the department celebrates by getting drunk. Despite her skepticism about politics and government, a drunken Ann pledges {{to do whatever it takes}} to help get the pit filled in, [...] "even if it takes two months". The episode ends with Ron explaining to the documentary crew how he makes his office as uninviting as possible.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall {{stated that the}} episode [...] "offered more laughs than some of this season's other episodes". Despite this, he criticized the episode's main plot with Andy, commenting that [...] "where giving Michael Scott power made him a funnier character {{than he would have}} been were he just another salesman, Andy <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> become less funny since the promotion". Chris Plante of New York called the episode [...] "funny, weird, touching, and unpredictable. A gem, really". National Post writer Barry Hertz compared the episode to [...] "Booze Cruise", [...] "Beach Games" [...] and [...] "The Search". M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B-. Several critics praised the return of former Office writer, Michael Schur as Mose Schrute. Barry Hertz said that [...] "the sight gag of him running atop a field of cars like a watered-down Evel Knievel was enough to give this episode an easy A".|$|E
500|$|Jorge Zalamea, El gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto ("The Great Burundún Burundá is Dead", 1951). For Keefe Ugalde, [...] "El gran Burundún Burundá... {{occupies}} {{an important}} midway {{point in the}} evolution of the dictator novel" [...] and Peter Neissa emphasizes [...] "its cultural and political importance and subsequent influence on dictator narratives." [...] More broadly, Martin describes this [...] "remarkable Colombian novelette" [...] as seeming to contain [...] "the seeds of García Márquez's mature style." [...] The book describes the (fictional) dictator [...] "Burundún's rise to power, selected events during his regime, and a description of his funeral." [...] It is at this funeral that it is revealed that the body of the dictator is absent, and <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> been replaced by or transformed into [...] "a great big parrot, a voluminous parrot, an enormous parrot, all swollen, inflated and wrapped in documents, gazettes, mail from abroad, newspapers, reports, annals, broadsheets, almanacs, official bulletins." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} Benioff {{said about}} Daenerys Targaryen's transformation during the series, [...] "I think Dany's been becoming a Targaryen {{ever since the}} beginning of Season 1". According to Weiss, [...] "She's not her father and she's not insane and she's not a sadist, but there's a Targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even the good Targaryens". Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who <b>has</b> <b>somehow</b> formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown. So if she can {{make it all the way}} across the Narrow Sea and get to Westeros, who's going to stand in her way?" ...|$|E
