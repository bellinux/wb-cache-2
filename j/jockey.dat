5|$|In 1913, the <b>Jockey</b> Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the <b>Jockey</b> Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{requirement}} of professional <b>jockeys</b> to make-weight daily, we tested the hypothesis that Flat and National Hunt (Jump) <b>jockeys</b> would display compromised health markers (bone health, vitamin D, liver and kidney function and mood) compared with established clinical norms, with Flat <b>jockeys</b> affected the greater. Daily energy intake was lower in Flat compared with Jump <b>jockeys</b> (6. 11 ± 1. 25 vs. 7. 47 ± 0. 83 MJ. day, P= 0. 01) whereas {{there was no difference}} in urine osmolality (811 ± 198 vs. 678 ± 317 mOsmol. kg respectively, P= 0. 13). Serum total 25 (OH) D was insufficient in Flat and Jump <b>jockeys</b> (37. 6 ± 28 vs. 35. 1 ± 14 nmol. L) respectively although there was no difference between groups (P= 0. 79). Markers of bone metabolism (Plasma ß-carboxy-terminal cross-linked teleopeptide (CTX) and Intact Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and liver and kidney function were within clinical normative ranges although CTX and PTH were higher than average. Abnormal mood profiles were observed in both groups although significantly poorer in the Flat <b>jockeys</b> (P= 0. 01). We conclude that the current practices of <b>jockeys</b> to make-weight may have detrimental effects upon their health with Flat <b>jockeys</b> affected more so than Jump <b>jockeys.</b> Future studies should investigate the effects of improved dietary practices on the mental and physical health of Flat and Jump <b>jockeys.</b> © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York...|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} {{has examined the}} effects of weight management on <b>jockey’s</b> wellbeing. However, there is a consensus that pervasive weight-loss practices (WLP) in the racing industry negatively impact on <b>jockey’s</b> physical, psychological and social wellbeing. The research reported herein {{examined the effects of}} the WLP used by flat-race <b>jockeys</b> on their physical, psychological and social wellbeing. In Study 1, 42 <b>jockeys</b> (10 women and 32 men) completed questionnaires examining eating behaviour, WLP and their physical, psychological and social effects of WLP. In Study 2, six male <b>jockeys</b> completed race day and non-race day assessments of WLP and mood and were interviewed about their experiences. In Study 3, eight <b>jockeys</b> (two women and six men); five family members (three wives and two fathers); and six industry professionals were interviewed about their perceptions and experiences of the lives of <b>jockeys.</b> Together the results of the studies showed that the WLP of <b>jockeys</b> have serious negative effects on their physiological, psychological and social wellbeing. <b>Jockeys</b> experience symptoms of life-threatening heat illness, negative mood, limited social interactions and strained relationships. Disordered eating behaviour was common and many <b>jockeys</b> reported symptoms consistent with DSM IV-TR disorders including Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Depression, General Anxiety Disorder and Social Phobia. Weight restriction symbolised a range of other restrictions that characterise jockeys’ lives. The term, Occupational Weight-Loss Disorder (OWLD) was coined to describe and explain the findings. Recommendations to reduce the harms documented included determining minimum weights, increasing time off, professional advice and profession suitability...|$|R
40|$|A {{requirement}} of the horse racing industry is for <b>jockeys</b> to achieve and maintain a low body weight. This potentially impacts on their food and fluid intake which may in turn influence both their {{short and long term}} health. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the nutritional status, eating behaviours and body composition of <b>jockeys</b> working in the New Zealand Racing Industry. Twenty <b>jockeys,</b> 9 senior (4 males, 5 females) and 11 apprentice (2 males, 9 females) were recruited. Questionnaires were used to provide demographic data, information on eating habits, smoking, and attempted practices in 'making weight'. The Eating Attitudes Test- 26 (EAT- 26) was used to determine the presence of disturbed eating patterns. <b>Jockeys</b> completed 7 -day weighed food records and Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to determine bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. Several indices were measured to determine iron status. Mean age of senior and apprentice <b>jockeys</b> was 28. 7 ± 5. 0 yrs and 20. 5 ± 3. 8 yrs respectively. There was a significant (p. 05) between the mean scores for male and female <b>jockeys.</b> Mean energy intake for male <b>jockeys</b> was 6769 ± 1339 kJ and for females 6213 ± 1797 kJ per day and the percentage of energy from carbohydrates (CHO) for all <b>jockeys</b> was 45. 5 ± 7. 9. Energy and CHO intakes were below the recommendations for both the athletic and non-athletic populations. Male and female <b>jockeys</b> did not meet the RDI for a number of micronutrients. Forty-four percent of <b>jockeys</b> were classified as osteopenic (2 males, 6 females). A number of factors may have contributed to this outcome, namely; reduced calcium intake, delayed menarche (14. 5 yrs) in female <b>jockeys,</b> alcohol intake and smoking. There was a significant (p <. 05) difference in the BMD of the distal wrist measurements compared with the measurements at the other three sites; lumbar spine, total body and femoral neck. Mechanical stress placed on the wrist while riding may have increased the BMD of that area. Percentage of body fat of male and female <b>jockeys</b> was 11. 7 ± 2. 9 and 23. 6 ± 3. 8 and for female <b>jockeys</b> this was greater than the recommendations for these athletes. Iron status was normal in all <b>jockeys.</b> The New Zealand Racing Conference has imposed weight restrictions on <b>jockeys</b> in the horse racing industry. As a consequence of this a number of <b>jockeys</b> compromise their nutritional status which may influence their sporting performance and both their short and long term health...|$|R

5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the <b>Jockey</b> Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American <b>Jockey</b> Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the <b>Jockey</b> Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E
