The newest mass medium, the Internet, has also significant impact on the form and development of diplomacy and international relations. These changes are most apparent on the form of public diplomacy and lead up to the creation of its new form <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is a topical issue in the theory of international relations, therefore there is no uniform definition of this new term.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{an innovative}} {{approach to the}} study of <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> by extending Castells? theory of communication power into a framework that can be applied to assess <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> efforts for state actors. Using the core constructs of communication power, the study develops a testable framework by which <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> strategy and networking practices can be assessed using both interviews with practitioners and network analysis of their practice. These two types of data enable exploration of mental models of networked logics as well as actual practice in the networked environment. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) was used as a case study for this project; however the framework can be applied to assess efforts of other states. The results indicate that the framework generated to assess power in state <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> efforts does provide a means to define and measure influence in state-driven Web 2. 0 activities. The framework was useful for assessing communication behaviors across a variety of Web 2. 0 platforms, but also utilized specific network analysis measures to assess influence on Twitter. In the case of Israeli <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> the degree to which network logics guide both strategy and practice was dependent on position within the organizational bureaucracy. Embassies had networked logics guiding both strategy and practice in the digital environment; however, the majority of consulates defaulted to mass-mediated uses of Web 2. 0 platforms. Network analysis indicated that despite being connected to a variety of sub-networks and key nodes in the digital environment, the MFA was not a frequently referenced node in in those subnetworks, particularly by influential nodes in those sub-communities. These trends indicate that they are operating from a position of counterpower on Twitter...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to define eDiplomacy and its three ideal-types of standardisation, power, and {{visibility}} and to analyse digital diplomacy’s application in practice by state and non-state actors. The questions this paper will try to answer are: 1) 	What are eDiplomacy and ediplomats? 2) 	To what extent can the practices of eDiplomacy be applied to the traditional and newly emerging diplomatic actors in terms of standardisation, power, and visibility? In this paper, e-diplomacy and its activities will be viewed as inherent to the practices of public diplomacy. However, the practice of <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is not limited to that of public diplomacy. One of the reasons is that the reduction of e-diplomacy to public diplomacy misses much of the power and capacity that ICTs can potentially provide (Holmes, 2013, p. 5). Therefore, this paper will contribute to the academic field of <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> by expanding the prevailing framework in the literature on <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> The arguments in this paper are based on the assumption that the hierarchical mentality and outmoded practices of traditional diplomatic actors no longer fit the reality of international relations. Consequentially, the old actors become marginalised by newly emerging ediplomats. In order to stay relevant in the field, diplomatic actors inevitably have to change their ways of thinking about digital technologies. <b>Digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and its implications on standardisation, power, and visibility allow diplomats to become active knowledge producers and influential public figures, thus bringing the diplomatic game to a new level...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} draw {{attention}} to the changing nature of power and diplomacy in the age of increasingly networked and digitalised society of 21 st century. Having a large army of soldiers and tanks could help to win a battle, but in order to be the winner in a war there must be other capabilities as well. Moreover, some smaller states do not have an opportunity to spend enormous resources on military – they have to find other ways to achieve their foreign policy goals. Today the battlefield is located inside people`s heads – the ability to attract and influence is crucial for achieving desired outcomes. After giving an overview about different facets of power the discussion continues with the examination of how the soft form of power could be made to work in reality. The author argues that the most fundamental aspect of this is proper communication with the focus on <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> – using digital tools (like social media) for engaging with foreign audiences and making public diplomacy. The main conclusion from theoretical part is that states which are ready to face these new challenges are most probably more successful in reaching their foreign policy objectives in the near and long future. In other words, <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and effective communication are crucial steps for small states in turning soft power resources into actual influence. Empirical part of the thesis concentrates on a small state that could be considered a digital success story, namely Estonia. Analysing the usage of social media by Estonian foreign policy actors, the thesis seeks to point out how active and successful these actors have been in using social media for <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and for engaging with foreign audiences. The results suggest that while there are some positive examples among these actors, there are also many shortcomings – some actors still seem not to understand the growing importance of <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> nor they do not make the most use of the opportunities social media offers. The thesis concludes with the Estonian case studies on <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and with the discussion on potential benefits that using social media could bring with – like countering Russian propaganda and ensuring the coherence in Estonian society...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} maximizing the impact and {{effectiveness}} of <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> has become high {{on the agenda of}} many ministries of foreign affairs (MFAs). What impact means in the digital context, how to capture it and how best to make use of it are questions that nevertheless remain poorly understood. Drawing heuristically on quantum theory, the article argues that the nature of the impact and the method of measuring it are two facets of the same ontological construct. The very act of measuring shapes the type of impact we may seek to capture. Getting <b>digital</b> <b>diplomacy</b> right on paper cannot therefore be reduced to an exercise of fine-tuning quantitative metrics. It involves a more complex approach that takes into account active listening to online conversations, careful prioritization of short and long-term objectives, hybridization of online/offline diplomatic agendas, mixed modes of engagement and creative mechanisms of adaptation...|$|E

The third part is a case study that will investigate how software, open platforms and processing of computerized data redefine, modernize and legitimize the way diplomats work, share information and engage with the general public for the greater good.
