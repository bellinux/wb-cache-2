Unfortunately this is often not the case, and often the patterning is visible - for example, often with images found on the web. In these circumstances {{it has been shown}} that a blue noise <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> is the least unsightly and distracting. [...] The error diffusion techniques were some of the first methods to generate blue noise dithering patterns. However, other techniques such as ordered dithering can also generate blue noise dithering without the tendency to degenerate into areas with artifacts.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} Kepler PRF/FPG data release. This data was taken on April 27 - 29, 2009, during Kepler's commissioning phase {{in order to}} measure the pixel response function (PRF) (Bryson et al., 2010 a) and focal plane geometry (FPG) (Tenenbaum and Jenkins, 2010). 33, 424 stellar targets were observed for 243 long cadences, each with a duration of 14. 7 minutes (half the duration of a normal Kepler long cadence). During these 243 cadences the Kepler photometer was moved, pointing in a <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> to facilitate PRF measurement. Motion occurred during the even cadences (second, fourth, etc.), with the telescope in stable fine point at each pointing in the <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> during the odd cadences (first, third, etc.). The first and last cadences were {{at the center of the}} <b>dither</b> <b>pattern.</b> Motion cadences are included in this release, but they do not contain any data. For details on how this data was used to derive the Kepler PRF and FPG models, see Bryson et al. (2010 a) and Tenenbaum and Jenkins (2010). Descriptions of the PRF and FPG models are found in Thompson et al. (2016), x 2. 3. 5. 17 and x 2. 3. 5. 16 respectively. The data in this release can be used to recompute the Kepler PRF and FPG. Such a reconstruction, however, would not reflect measured seasonal changes in the PRF described in Van Cleve et al. (2016 b), x 5. 2. The <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> is shown in Figure 1. The crosses show the commanded pointings and the circles show the measured pointings. Measured pointings are different from the commanded pointings due to the early state of calibration of the fine guidance sensors during commissioning (Van Cleve et al., 2016 a). The measured offsets from the center of the pattern are given in RADEC offsets and pixel offsets in Table 1. The order of the offsets was randomized during data collection to avoid time-dependent systematics...|$|E

Since the MRS {{will be used to}} map star forming regions and nearby galaxies that are significantly larger than the short wavelength (Channel 1) field-of-view (3. 00 ″x 3. 87 ″) but smaller than the FGS FOV, dithering will be required to tile MRS FOVs to map extended sources without triggering new observatory visits.

We propose that the MRS <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> be composed of two components: (1) a primary <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> that is used to tile MRS FOVs to map extended astronomical objects and (2) a choice of two secondary dither patterns that can be executed at each tile position.

40|$|We {{present a}} study on direct imaging dither {{patterns}} for MIRI. We propose {{a combination of a}} compact <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> (4 -Point Parallelogram) that is optimized for sub-pixel sampling and larger patterns (12 -Point Reuleaux and Cycling for imaging with the FULL, BRIGHTSKY, and SUB 256 subarrays or 5 -Point Gaussian for imaging with the SUB 128 and SUB 64 subarrays) that mitigate the effects of bad pixels and changing scattered light and/or thermal emission backgrounds. Although we propose a compact pattern with a fixed size scale, we propose larger dither patterns with average step sizes that scale approximately with wavelength because MIRI will provide diffraction-limited imaging between 5. 6 and 25. 5 µm. We suggest that observers should be allowed to obtain data with the 4 -point dither alone or at each position within a Reuleaux, Cycling or Gaussian pattern to provide optimal sub-pixel sampling and self-calibration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generalization of dispersed-dot dithering. While existing {{methods such as}} Bayer’s assume that color dots are arranged in a square matrix, this method works with arbitrarily-placed color points. To create a good <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> for arbitrarily-placed points, they must be ordered so that consecutive pairs are maximally separated. In this papre, the ordering is obtained by hierarchically coloring the vertices of the points’ adjacency graph. Each level in the coloring hierarchy adds a color digit to each graph vertex’s label, and sorting the resulting multi-digit labels produces the desired consecutive-point separation. The method can reproduce Bayer’s dispersed-dot dither matrices, but can also produce many similar matrices. Multiple matrices {{can be used to}} minimize repetitive artifacts that plague Bayer dither, while retaining its parallelizability. The method can also be applied to artistic dithering: given a repeatable motif image, its pixels can be grouped into subsets, one for each gray level, and each subset ordered. Concatenating the subsets yields a dither matrix that reproduces a motif while displaying an overall image. Unlike in previous artistic dither methods, the motif image can be arbitrary, and need not be specially constructed...|$|E
40|$|Reduction of {{feature space}} of visual {{descriptors}} has become important {{due to the}} ‘curse of dimensionality’ problem. This paper reports the efficiency and effectiveness of the Compacted <b>Dither</b> <b>Pattern</b> Code (CDPC) combined with the Bhattacharyya classifier over MPEG- 7 Dominant Colour Descriptor (DCD). Both the CDPC and DCD syntactic features use a compact feature space for colour representation. The algorithmic comparison {{between the two is}} presented in this paper, and demonstrates that there are several competitive advantages of CDPC in feature extraction and classification stages when compared to MPEG- 7 DCD. The embedded texel properties, spatial colour arrangements, high compactness, and robust feature representation of CDPC have proven its effectiveness in our experimental study. Visual description experiments were conducted for ten irregular shapes-based visual concepts in videos with three setups namely CDPC with Bhattacharyya classifier, DCD without spatial coherency and DCD with spatial coherency. The visual descriptions were performed with the TRECVID 2007 development key frame dataset. The experimental results are presented in terms of three common performance measures. The results show that CDPC with Bhattacharyya classifier provides a good generalised performance for irregular shapes-based visual description as compared to the other experimental setups...|$|E

Here we use gPhoton to generate light curves for all hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars that were observed by GALEX, {{with the intention of}} identifying short-period, p-mode pulsations.

This is particularly important for studies of weak gravitational lensing, where the ability to deconvolve the PSF from galaxy shapes is of paramount importance. We show that stochastic aliasing of the PSF necessarily occurs during ‘drizzling’, the image reduction step where individual exposures are combined and the large geometric distortion in the ACS WFC is removed. This aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale {{is equal to the}} input pixel scale of 0. 05 ”. Using simulated stars, we show that this source of PSF variation can be significantly reduced by choosing a Gaussian drizzle kernel with a size of 0. 8 input pixels and by setting the output pixel size to 0. 03 ”. This result has been tested mainly on the COSMOS images which have four input exposures each dithered by about 60 pixels in the y direction. However, the recommendation holds for any ACS WFC data set taken with a similar number of input exposures and a <b>dither</b> <b>pattern</b> that does not cause output pixels to be derived from input pixels that are a significant fraction of the ACS WFC chips away from each other in differen...|$|E
