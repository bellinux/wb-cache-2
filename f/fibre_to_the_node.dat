25|$|In 2005, Telstra {{announced}} it would invest A$210 million in upgrading all of its ADSL exchanges to support ADSL2+ by mid-2006, though they did not say whether they would continue to restrict access speeds.

25|$|The National Broadband Network was {{initially}} a fibre {{to the home}} (FTTH) open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national broadband network aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Node</b> (FTTN) broadband network providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed wireless technology and satellite technology to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{one third}} of the Dutch {{population}} has a fibre optic connection, also called <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home (FttH). <b>Fibre</b> is currently the fastest and most reliable Internet technology. It consists of strong and flexible wires that are able to transport light signals over long distances. With such fibre optic connections, information is transmitted {{from one place to another}} when pulses of light are sent through an optical fibre and can reach Internet speeds of 500 Mb per second. In an ideal situation, all copper in the networks would be replaced by fiber. However, such an operation would be too expensive to complete all at once, so therefore, it would not be a feasible solution. However, it is also possible to replace parts of the copper network by fibre. For example, <b>the</b> extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curb could significantly increase <b>the</b> bandwidth, compared <b>to</b> services offered over a copper cable starting at the Central Office. Furthermore, for this extension, less costs are also involved compared to an extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Home. On the other hand, <b>the</b> extension <b>to</b> a total <b>fibre</b> network will reach a higher bandwidth compared to an extension of <b>Fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Curb...|$|R

2500|$|On [...] Telstra, {{the owner}} of the {{national}} copper network, announced a plan to upgrade its ageing networks, including a rollout of a <b>fibre</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>node</b> (FTTN) network. At the time, the Federal Government was the majority shareholder of Telstra, but the plan did not involve any additional government investment. The rollout was later put on hold after the Howard Government refused to exempt the new network from laws requiring third party access, instead saying Telstra could achieve the exemption by applying to the competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). Telstra dropped plans for the new network on , after reaching an impasse in negotiations with the ACCC. Former ACCC chairman, Graeme Samuel later said the proposal was 'an illusion on cost and on the capacity to truly deliver high-speed broadband to end users'.|$|E
