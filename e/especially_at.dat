5|$|A park pass is {{required}} for stopping {{in the park and}} permit checks are common during the summer months, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.|$|E

5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to drive through Algonquin Park.

5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking. The basin became deeper (<b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the base of the headwall) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.|$|E
5|$|The LFR ground {{component}} {{consisted of}} a network of radio transmission stations which were strategically located around the country, often near larger airports, approximately 200 miles apart. Early LFR stations used crossed loop antennas, but later designs were all based on the Adcock vertical antenna array for improved performance, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E

5|$|A US$15 million performing-arts {{program at}} the fair ranged from a boxing {{championship}} to an international twirling competition but with no shortage of nationally and internationally famous performers, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the new Opera House and Playhouse. After the fair, the Playhouse became the Seattle Repertory Theatre; in the mid-1980s it became the Intiman Playhouse.

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games. To celebrate his retirement, there was a ceremony in Van Grunsven's home town and a farewell ride at an international jumping competition in Maastricht, Netherlands. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never thought she would find another horse {{as good as he}} was; however, his successor Salinero proved to be even more successful.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{appointment}} {{coincided with}} more trained men and better equipment becoming available. Under Brooke, new strategies and tactics were devised. More concentration {{was placed on}} defending the coastal crust, while inland a hedgehog defence strategy of defended localities and anti-tank islands was established, each having all-round defence. Many of these anti-tank islands were established along the already constructed stop lines, where existing defences could {{be integrated into the}} new strategy and, <b>especially,</b> <b>at</b> towns and villages where there was a Home Guard to provide personnel.|$|E

5|$|Cyclopean fortifications were {{typical of}} Mycenaean walls, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, Argos, Crisa and Athens, while smaller {{boulders}} {{are found in}} Midea and large limestone slabs are found at Gla. In the Mycenaean settlements found in Epirus and Cyprus, Cyclopean-style walls are also present, {{as well as in}} western Anatolia. Besides the citadels, isolated forts were also erected on various strategic locations. The fortification systems also incorporated technical refinements such as secret cisterns, galleries, sally ports and projecting bastions for the protection of gateways. On the other hand, the palace of Pylos, although a major center of power, paradoxically appears to have been left without any defensive walls.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel Lasker {{was born}} on December 24, 1868 at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), {{the son of a}} Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. According to the website Chessmetrics, Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s. To {{supplement}} their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the CaféKaiserhof.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the beginning; {{and there are also}} {{innovations}} in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of the story {{on the part of the}} revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} fish, shellfish, and {{crustaceans}} frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably crayfish and paua. Nugget Point {{in the northern}} Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a marine reserve off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector's dolphins can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected {{as part of the}} Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can be spotted along the coastline during winter.|$|E
5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is critical to cardiac function <b>especially</b> <b>at</b> fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E
