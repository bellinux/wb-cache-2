I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Farage {{takes an}} anti-prohibitionist {{position}} on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by The Daily Telegraph {{he argued that}} the War on Drugs had been lost [...] "many, many years ago", stating that [...] "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do,</b> but I just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." [...] He argued in favour of a Royal Commission on drugs exploring all avenues as how to most effectively legislate on drugs and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their legalisation.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of whether his next project would be an album or a mixtape, Lamar answered: [...] "I treat every project like it's an album anyway. It's {{not going to be}} nothing {{leftover}}. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> nothing like that. These are my leftover songs you all can have them. I'm going to put my best out. My best effort. I'm trying to look for an album in 2012." [...] In June 2011, Lamar released [...] "Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)", a cut from Section.80, featuring Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA. On July 2, 2011, Lamar released Section.80, his first independent album, to critical acclaim. The album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin Munroe, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul, while the production was handled by Top Dawg in-house production team Digi+Phonics as well as Wyldfyer, Terrace Martin and J. Cole. Section.80 went on to sell 5,300 digital copies in its first week, without any television or radio coverage and received mostly positive reviews.|$|E

2500|$|In {{introducing}} [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", Elton John said {{he believed}} it to be [...] "one of the best songs ever written." [...] The Lennon-sung [...] "I Saw Her Standing There" [...] (credited to the Elton John Band featuring John Lennon) was originally released in 1975 on the B-side of Elton John's [...] "Philadelphia Freedom" [...] single. In 1981, all three live songs were issued on 28th November 1974, an Elton John EP. In 1990, the three songs were made available on the Lennon box set. In 1996, they were also included on the remastered edition of Elton John's Here and There album. Elton John once stated that [...] " [...] 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is a song that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> in a set at a concert simply because it reminds me too much of John Lennon. This is the same with 'Empty Garden'." [...] It {{was a part of}} his standard repertoire from 1974 until 1976, and sporadically until 1998. It also appeared in the 1976 musical documentary All This and World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Although Michaels {{expressed}} happiness at Hart's 2006 induction {{into the}} Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism. Michaels criticized Hart's behavior and conduct during {{his days in}} WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a [...] "mafia hit," [...] and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would [...] "never forgive" [...] Michaels. In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the WrestleMania 22 weekend. Michaels {{decided to leave the}} Hall of Fame ceremony early to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining {{in an interview that he}} had never intended to attend or appear at the show. Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007 edition of Raw, where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon's [...] "appreciation night." [...] While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008 radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels' version of the incident, saying, [...] "Shawn's this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that I never even hit him and I thought, 'This guy is such a liar'. I wonder what kind of Christian he is." [...] Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, [...] "No. And I hope <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>do...</b> for his sake." ...|$|E
