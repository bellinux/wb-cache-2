5000|$|The Universal Floppy Disk Controller (UFDC) was an add-on {{floppy disk}} {{interface}} developed by Microcomputer Engineering (MCE). The UFDC {{was based on}} the Western Digital WD2793 floppy disk controller chip and had a Z80 DMA controller on board. The most popular disk format was 5" [...] (133 mm) 80 track, <b>double</b> <b>sided,</b> <b>double</b> <b>density</b> using a Mitsubishi floppy drive mechanism. This gave a formatted disk capacity of 800kB. The UFDC's use of DMA required the VDUEB upgrade to be present. To install the disk controller, the Z80 CPU was removed from the main computer board and installed on the UFDC board. The UFDC then piggybacked on the socket vacated by the CPU. This meant that in theory, the UFDC could be used with almost any Z80 based system, provided there was enough physical space above the CPU. The UFDC used a primitive track based disk operating system called [...] "Super-80 DOS", however a CP/M BIOS later became available.|$|E

Finally, a linear switched reluctance motor prototype was built following the proposed design and was verified by experimental measurements. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Welding in the {{manufacturing}} industry has {{an important role in}} the process of joining metals. One method of welding metal is friction stir welding / friction stir welding (FSW). Friction stir welding method of welding is welding by utilizing the heat due to rotation of the tool that is rubbing against the parent material or workpiece. Friction stir welding method is generally used to connect the aluminum material. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of the depth of immersion pin (depth plunge) to changes in physical and mechanical properties of friction stir weld <b>double</b> <b>sides</b> (<b>double</b> <b>sided</b> friction stir welding). This study was conducted using a vertical milling machine for material Al 5083 with the long dimension of 200 mm x width 100 mm x thickness of 3 mm by 6 specimens. The parameters used are rotational speed 1250 rpm spindle, feeding speed of 12. 5 mm / min, immersion depth variation pin 0. 9 mm, 1. 9 mm and 2. 9 mm. After the welding process is completed followed by tensile testing, testing micro vickers, macro image and a micro photograph. From the test results known to the highest tensile stress on variations plunge depth of 1. 9 mm amounted to 177. 78 Mpa. For testing micro vickers welding area decreased hardness when compared with the parent metal and HAZ region has the lowest hardness. While in the observation of the macro image of welding is plugged in, but it happens on a welding defect cavity with variations plunge depth of 2. 9 mm. In observation of micro photograph happen diminution grain structure in the region stir zone. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} after taking possession, the lumber and {{building}} materials for the station having been landed, Captain Healy sent his carpenters and {{a portion of his}} crew on shore and erected a substantial frame house, 20 by 60 feet in size. The supply of lumber, however, gave out before it was fully completed, so that it was not as comfortable for an Arctic winter as was intended. Before the completion of the frame building, Miner W. Bruce, the superintendent, had constructed a “dugout” for himself and assistant and another for the Siberian herders. These “ dugouts” were occupied during the severity of the winter weather. During the summer of 1893 additional lumber and material were sent to the station, and Healy again sent his carpenters and sailors on shore to do the needed work of placing the main station building in complete order for comfortable use. The whole house had <b>double</b> <b>sides</b> and <b>double</b> floor, with tarred paper between. A large “lean-to” was erected {{in the rear of the}} house for the use of the herders.

A method of obtaining these high efficiencies using multidimensional Multiple Phase Shift Keying (MPSK) and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) signal sets with trellis coding is described. These schemes have advantages in decoding speed, phase transparency, and coding gain in comparison to other trellis coding schemes. Finally, a general parity check equation for rotationally invariant trellis codes is introduced from which non-linear codes for two dimensional MPSK and QAM signal sets are found. These codes are fully transparent to all rotations of the signal set...|$|R
