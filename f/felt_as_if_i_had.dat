It <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been instantly transported {{far into the future}} and that I was on another planet," [...] said journalist Bernard Levin of his first impressions of the building.|$|E
2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was {{the top-ranked}} country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv. [...] Israel was {{represented}} by Ram, Erlich, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy. [...] Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8). [...] The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: [...] "With all due respect, Israel was lucky {{to get to the}} quarterfinals." [...] The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. [...] Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match. [...] Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5. [...] Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well." [...] The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. [...] The next day Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. [...] "I started to cry like a little boy", said Ram. [...] Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a [...] "thrilling" [...] win. [...] Captain Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. [...] With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were [...] "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Ram said: [...] "We have all grown up together since the age of 14. The reason we are in the semis is because we are a united team." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it, Janet," [...] said Anne repentantly. [...] "I just <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{stood by}} and seen murder done. I HAD to run after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> struck him. [...] "Ah, 'lived'--!" [...] he murmured, turning short away from me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't,' said Gethryn pathetically. 'The {{only time}} I've ever <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> really {{was going to}} make that century. By Jove, see that drive? Pringle seems all right.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped to}} kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{should go}} wild <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't come—if I didn't rush. I didn't {{know how you}} might have taken me, Lettie when I said—what I did." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{stepped on}} {{the place where the}} last stair ought to have been, but wasn't. I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and there didn't seem {{anything}} to defy.|$|E
60|$|After {{two days}} and nights, I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived there for a year, and yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} why the retreat was not begun, {{if we were to}} make one, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a personal grievance against the lieutenant because he failed to give that order which would permit of our getting away from such a disagreeable situation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't help it,' again {{said the}} girl. 'The river noise was so like everything--and I knew the way--and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> must go before any one was up.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{earth was}} praising God that Sunday as I rode to Mr. Bordley's. And {{as it is}} sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in church.|$|R
6000|$|... "If He's {{as good as}} {{your father}} He'll do for me," [...] said Mary. [...] "When your father was talking to me <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never could be bad any more." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{sense of}} fatigue {{overpowered}} me. I had no wish, after my {{long hours of}} reading and thinking, to lie down and sleep. It was strange, but it was so. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> slept, and had now just awakened--a new woman, with a new mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I covered {{myself with}} mud," [...] Rupert laughed. [...] "Next day, when I had dried a little, I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been dipped in dough and then baked. I am sure I {{looked like a}} pie in human shape when you first saw me, did I not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer smell--yes! Like bilge or a rank swamp. It was {{distinctly}} nauseating; when I {{came out}} I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just {{been going to}} be sick. I shall try back on my visit and see if I can recall any more of what I saw or felt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He--he sort of {{degraded}} me. He {{wanted to}} bully {{me because he}} hadn't got me. And then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to run, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty." ...|$|R
6000|$|At that moment--for {{a moment}} only--I almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have said}} to Effie, [...] "Take him!" [...] but the thing was too impossible--a {{something}} within us rises against it--and I said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. Do you know, {{out there}} just now I felt--. When I heard that these {{aeroplanes}} were a stage nearer. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were fighting {{the machinery of}} fate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{astonished}} me," [...] he added. [...] "It went {{as straight}} {{to my heart}} as though you had smiled {{for the purpose of}} dazzling me. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen a smile before in my life. I thought of it after I left you. It made me restless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George! I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> six legs when we {{were going}} the pace. We were all one piece, and had a jolly spin, didn't we, my beauty?" [...] and Ben chuckled as he took Lita's head in his lap, while she {{answered}} with a gusty sigh that nearly blew him away.|$|E
60|$|I {{went to work}} {{therefore}} without delay, {{but before}} doing so once again solemnly and earnestly committed my soul and body {{to the care of}} God. And, truly, the circumstances of my case intensified that prayer. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never really prayed in earnest in my life before that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, if {{you don't}} call that scandylos——!' said old Ma Stainwright, and Meg began to cry. You don't know, Cyril! She sobbed fit to break her heart. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have killed}} him.|$|R

5000|$|William Nicholson, {{writer of}} Shadowlands (1985) and Gladiator (2000), said: “I hate this film. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{watching}} all my own excuses {{for not doing}} anything about climate change being stripped away from me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was a woman}} long hid amid {{packs of}} years, She might have been living or dead; she was lost to my sight, [...] And the deed that had nigh drawn tears Was done in a casual {{clearance}} of life's arrears; But I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put her to death that night! [...] .|$|E
60|$|Hours after--or so {{it seemed}} to me--we reached the spot at which our ways divided. We stopped, and I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{suddenly}} cast back into the workaday world from some distant and pleasanter planet. I think Phyllis must have felt much the same sensation, for we both became on the instant intensely practical and businesslike.|$|E
6000|$|I {{rose and}} stood by the door with my hat in my hand, hesitating and trembling. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} to say to Irene, and yet I was half afraid to venture upon saying it. My fingers quivered, a thing very unusual with me. At last I came closer to her, after a long pause, and said, [...] "Irene." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} make Pearse's point of view clear. Before this old man, with his {{inflexible}} will and sense of duty, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> held a brief for Zachary, and must try to do him justice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Anne, 'I never <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew or liked her. I believe Rupert and I {{were very}} unkind {{to her in}} our younger days; but, oh! {{she was the most}} {{tiresome}} whining child I ever knew.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well for me I did not perish {{with these}} wild thoughts! I am glad I {{have told you}} at last. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ought to confess it, and yet I was ashamed. Is the thing safe?' ...|$|R
