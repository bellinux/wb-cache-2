To further analyze alterations to the cell, we evaluated the impact these volatile organic compounds have on membrane composition and hence fluidity. Both (E) - 2 -octenal and oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol exposure caused a shift to unsaturated fatty acids and lower cholesterol levels in the membrane. This indicates that the volatile organic compounds under investigation increased membrane fluidity. These vast changes to the cell membrane are known to contribute to the breakdown of normal cell function and possibly lead to death.

Central composite design-response surface methodology was used to {{study the effects of}} different temperature and humidity of storage conditions on the fungal growth in A. oxyphylla and accumulation of aflatoxins.

Temperatures below 25  °C and humidity below 85 % were the best storage conditions to preventing A. oxyphylla from becoming moldy.

Central composite design-response surface methodology was used to study the effects of different storage temperature and humidity conditions on fungal growth in A. oxyphylla and subsequent production of aflatoxins. The volatile compound and polysaccharide composition was then determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and spectrophotometry, respectively. Aflatoxins (including AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1 and AFG 2) were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).

In this research, Si-HDPE hybrid micro-lens arrays were press molded under various conditions, and the form accuracy and surface integrity of the molded lenses were evaluated. Air trapping occurs inside the micro-lens cavities during molding in a non-vacuum environment, which leads to severe surface defects. To investigate the air trapping phenomenon, a new in-situ observation system was developed which enables real-time direct observation of the molding process.

The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the potential of different strains of lactic acid bacteria producing antifungal compounds during faba bean and pearl millet fermentation, to facilitate their application in baked foods with extended shelf-life. Different species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faba bean and pearl millet in previous studies were used singly as a starter for sourdough fermentation. Antifungal assays were carried out on target molds and selected sourdoughs showing antifungal activity were analyzed to assess the nature of antifungal compounds (e. g. organic acids and proteinaceous compounds). All of the water-soluble extracts from sourdoughs were able to inhibit the growth of the indicator molds P. paneum and P. albocoremium, but not A. niger. This was in agreement with previous findings, showing that sensibility towards different antifungal compounds is not identical across different molds. The concentration of organic acids and the potential proteinaceous nature of the most active extracts was also established.

This research focused on the direct relationship between produce spoilage and tightly controlled humidity and temperature settings, {{with the goal of}} generating new information capable of driving innovation in the field. The objectives of this research were to store a model fresh fruit (strawberries) and a vegetable (romaine lettuce) in an environmental chamber capable of maintaining and reporting specified humidity and temperature conditions, and quantifying spoilage effects at various temperature and humidity levels. Ultimately, the goal is to provide the industry with {{a better understanding of the}} intersection between controllable food storage conditions, microbial spoilage, and food safety. Nine spoilage tests were completed at 7 yC, 5 yC and 3 yC at relative humidities of 95 %, 75 % and 50 % (see Figure 1). The overall results can be seen in Table 2 and the summary is as follows: Romaine lettuce heads lasted the longest, and stayed the freshest at high humidity (~ 95 %), with temperature having a lesser impact. If humidity control is not possible, aseptically separating leaves and storing them individually in sterile, sealable bags will enhance organoleptic quality at low temperatures (~ 3 yC), although this is probably not possible in practice. Strawberries stored at low temperature and humidity (~ 3 yC and ~ 50 %) resisted molding the longest, and lost firmness after 1 - 2 weeks.

The experimental results showed that melt temperature and packing pressure were the processing parameters that most affected the shrinkage of thin-wall parts. In particular, a selection of high values for these parameters allowed for the minimization of the dimensional difference between the mold and the final parts. The analysis of the cross sections of the moldings allowed the observation of an almost flat trend of the orientation tensor for parts molded at lower injection speed, indicating the absence of the core layer.

Results analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method have shown that from the considered parameters, only the dart diameter and test temperature have significant influence on the falling weight impact properties. Higher dart diameter leads to higher peak force and peak energy results. Conversely, higher levels of test temperatures lead to lower values of peak force and peak energy.

A result among these two different parameters concerns can be achieved by getting the experiment done which on the other hand, selection of better mold material and use of coating will further provide an improved solution. In this thesis, efforts towards determining good surface finish will be decide using different mold properties and coating. The quality of the surface roughness is determined by using visual and analysis. This Surface Roughness is obtained based on the analyzed using MAHR Perthometer s 2. In this present work, the main objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the effect of coating between two patterns and decide which one has a better surface finish and to compare mold material whether carbon dioxide, CO 2 molding or Greensand molding with and without coating and their effect in product surface finish. The standard design approach is implemented in this experimental study where it only consists of 2 factors at one time which are coating and mold material. 2 patterns and 4 final products are produced, whereby the study output is surface roughness, Ra (µm). In this study, MAHR Perthometer s 2 is used to measure the surface roughness. The comparison between pattern and product will be analyzed. From the findings, it is shown that that product that used carbon dioxide CO 2 as mold material and covered with coating has the best surface finish. Based on the study analysis, it is discovered that using green sand as mold material and not using coating produces poor surface finish while carbon dioxide CO 2 with coating produces good surface finish products...|$|R
