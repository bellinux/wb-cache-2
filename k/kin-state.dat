40|$|This article {{examines}} the external sources of separatism in Azerbaijan. The author claims {{that in the case}} of Azerbaijan many separatist movements are fed by outside powers rather than caused by inside sources. This article does not intend to review the situation with regard to the political, economic and cultural rights of ethnic minorities. Azerbaijan, like many other post-Soviet republics, went through a transition period characterized by sharp economic decline, dissolution of social institutions, change of values, etc. Quite rightfully, some claims of leaders of ethnic minorities about discrimination might be reasonable and justifiable. In the circumstances of post-Soviet transition, no country escaped from injustices, disorders and social turbulences. However, in many cases separatist movements were used by regional powers and countries concerned, particularly so-called <b>kin-states</b> to advance their political agenda. The author argues that in Azerbaijan most separatist sentiments are instigated and directed mainly from abroad...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{political}} {{aspects of the}} situation of the Polish minority in the contemporary Republic of Lithuania. Basis and practice of the Lithuanian ethnic and language policy, relevant sociodemographic features of the Polish minority, and their interaction within the political system, as manifested by the patterns of Polish minority mobilization and representation in the political structures, are successively analyzed in mutual cohesion. A study of the political dimension of the Lithuanian Poles' and the Polish <b>kin-state's</b> interrelationship together with a brief comparison of their situation with kin minorities in Belarus and Ukraine contextualize the analysis. In spite of both comparatively very good endogenous resources and the formally non-discriminatory political practice of the Lithuanian state, the thesis documents Polish minority's underrepresentation within the political system, as caused by the political opportunity structures. Aggregation and articulation of Polish minority interests in contemporary Lithuania fully comply with conventional patterns in institutionalized democracies. However, the findings of the thesis contradict the presumption of eventual weakening of the Lithuanian-Polish ethnic cleavage within the political system, and, more to the contrary, point to proofs of actual [...] ...|$|R

The real issue behind the debate about a possible «21st century concept of nation» is not the definition itself, but the acceptance of a new way of thinking, of rethinking the nation, and specifically the transversality of the nation across boundaries - a nation often, but not always, deeply rooted in history. Following the two world wars in the 20th century, national borders were redrawn and, as a result, parts of the <b>kin-state</b> now live in the territory of one of the neighbouring states, where they represent «national minorities or communities»".

High Representative Valentin Inzko openly confronted Milorad Dodik {{over the}} decision on the referendum, giving him seven days to withdraw the referendum decision, and announcing readiness to use its executive powers to annul the decision and impose sanctions on the RS leaders, up until dismissing Dodik from his post, should the referendum (deemed {{a violation of the}} Dayton legal order) proceed. In response, the RS leadership threatened to withdraw all Serb representative from BiH institutions, including the Presidency and Council of Ministers, the Parliament and the judiciary.The decision about calling the referendum did not gather as much support as expected from <b>kin-state</b> Serbia, with President Boris Tadic unwilling to [...] "interfere" [...] in Bosnia's internal affairs, while expressing opposition to OHR's plans and calling for a solution of the crisis through compromise.The debate on the issue at the UN Security Council on 9 May 2011 did not produce a common stance due to the disagreement of Russia with Inzko's position, and the reserves of China.Meanwhile, a publication of the influential think-tank International Crisis Group recommended a more moderate approach and deemed counterproductive to proceed confrontationally against Dodik. Finally, the issue was solved after a meeting between the RS President and the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, in which Dodik agreed to withdraw the referendum in exchange for a [...] "Structured Dialogue on Justice" [...] among Bosnian institutions and the EU in which to discuss the substantial grievances of the RS authorities towards the BiH judiciary. While the EU intervention allowed to avert the crisis and revert the situation to the status quo in early April, the threat of a RS referendum remained in the background, as Dodik never withdrawn the legal acts concerning it.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} the often neglected concept of 2 ̆ 7 claimed co-ethnics 2 ̆ 7 {{in the analysis}} of citizenship policies. It argues that this is an interstitial category that further complicates the triadic nexus between national minorities, nationalising states and <b>kin-states.</b> The 2 ̆ 7 claimed co-ethnics 2 ̆ 7 are defined as people who are recognised by the citizenship (or ethnizenship) conferring state as belonging to its main ethnic group, although they themselves do not embrace that definition. In addition to bringing the issue of claimed co-ethnics into focus, the paper elucidates how citizenship policies can affect groups that challenge the exact fit between ethnicity and nation, showing how national governments through particular citizenship policies and categorisation practices engage in the construction of these groups. The paper shows that the triadic nexus framework, which has had a strong influence on citizenship and minorities scholarship, needs to be revised to include unidirectional relations between the elements of the triadic nexus. The paper is based on the comparison between the cases of ethnic Vlachs (in the context of Albania and Greece) and Bunjevci (in the context of Serbia and Croatia) ...|$|R
50|$|The High Commissioner {{will assist}} in {{preventing}} an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, {{which should be}} upheld {{by the state and}} other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, <b>kin-states,</b> policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention. The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as {{this is one of the}} major causes of inter-ethnic tension. However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language. The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict. This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the challenges to broadcasting in minority languages in South East Europe. It looks closely at the demand for, and supply and use of, minority language media {{in two of the}} successor states to the former Yugoslavia and investigates the constraints on achieving institutional completeness in media for national minorities in those two states. The evidence presented indicates that smallness, defined by both population size and economic conditions, is an important limitation, despite state policies designed to ensure the provision of media in the languages of national minorities. The article also shows how definitional issues and particular historical legacies further complicate the provision of media services for existing national minorities. It considers these problems {{in the context of the}} changing broadcasting landscape in which multi-channel subscription services on cable, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and even digital terrestrial television networks (DTT) facilitate cross-border transmission and consumption. The article argues that in this new environment, cultural preservation and identity-related aims might be served within the region of South East Europe, but that the democratic and public participation of national minorities in their home state is at risk. It also points out the specific problems of the minorities without neighbouring <b>kin-states</b> such as the Roma and Vlach...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} importance and prevalence of <b>kin-state</b> policies, this thesis identifies three gaps in existing <b>kin-state</b> research. Theoretically, existing literature focuses on how kin relations can induce or reduce conflict between states, overlooking {{the dynamics of}} interaction between kin-states and kin communities. Conceptually, existing literature focuses on kin communities as minorities, overlooking kin majorities. Methodologically, existing literature focuses on top-down institutional and state-level analyses of <b>kin-state</b> relations, overlooking bottom-up agency-centred perspectives. To address these gaps, the thesis develops a model of nested integration, to analyse relations been kin-states and kin majorities from a bottom-up perspective. Nested integration does not challenge the borders separating <b>kin-state</b> from kin communities, but affects {{the meaning of this}} border. The thesis examines the comparative explanatory power of this model of nested integration by generating evidence about the meanings of kin identification and engagement with different <b>kin-state</b> practices, through a cross-case comparison of Crimea vis-à-vis Russia and Moldova vis-à-vis Romania. These cases are selected from a wider kin majority typology as two contrasting examples of <b>kin-state</b> policies: Romanian citizenship in Moldova and Russian quasi-citizenship Compatriot policy in Crimea. Overall, the thesis argues that Moldova exhibits more nested integration than Crimea because of the type, legitimacy and availability of <b>kin-state</b> provision, which the thesis argues is consequential for the degree of nested integration observed. The thesis also refines the model of nested integration, by taking account of empirical evidence, arguing for the importance of considering internal fractionalization within the kin majority, social dependence and geopolitical dependence. Incorporating these elements within the model shows <b>kin-state</b> relations to concern not only issues of identity, but also security, public goods provision and geopolitical region-building narratives. These elements have been overlooked by existing research and demonstrate the importance of a bottom-up, agency-centred and comparative perspective for <b>kin-state</b> scholarship...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} an understudied form {{of third}} party peacemaking, namely peacemaking interventions with <b>kin-state</b> involvement. The main research question this thesis seeks to analyse is how local actors, their kin-states and third party peacemakers interact {{within the context}} of a peacemaking intervention for power-sharing in deeply divided societies. The literature on third party peacemaking largely neglects the role of kin-states in peacemaking, while in the literature on power-sharing the role of external actors, including kin-states, remains understudied. This thesis aims to address these gaps by investigating the recent peacemaking interventions for power-sharing with <b>kin-state</b> involvement in Cyprus, Bosnia and Northern Ireland. The findings of the case studies are combined and assessed through the use of a five-level analytical framework, which includes the local actors level; the local actors-third party peacemaker level; the local actors-kin-state(s) level; the third party peacemaker-kin-state(s) level; and the kin-states level. The analysis identifies a number of conditions pertinent to each of these levels which affect peacemaking interventions for power-sharing in deeply divided societies with <b>kin-state</b> involvement. There are two main original contributions of this thesis to the above mentioned literatures. First, it proposes a typology of <b>kin-state</b> involvement in peacemaking, which categorises <b>kin-state</b> involvement into four roles: promoter; quasi-mediator; power-broker; and enforcer. Second, through the use of game theoretical analysis, more specifically a nested games approach, it illustrates how the interaction between local actors, their kin-states and third party peacemakers can be modelled in the context of a peacemaking intervention for power-sharing. The empirical and theoretical conclusions of this study indicate that <b>kin-state</b> involvement in third peacemaking interventions is more complex and fluid than widely assumed...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>kin-state</b> involvement in ethnic conflicts and wars is often {{recognised in the}} literature, yet little theorising exists. This article analyses the links between the Serbian regime and the Serb leaders in Croatia and Bosnia during the Yugoslav war. Contrary to widespread assumptions, it finds that Slobodan Miloevi was not always able to control local developments; the local Serb leaders became increasingly rebellious and possessed means for limiting Belgrade's influence. Instead of assuming static ethnic solidarities, the analysis focuses on intra-ethnic divisions and the supply of resources and is thereby able to capture the fluidity of <b>kin-state</b> relations and the potentially limited longevity of such ties. It shows that links between a <b>kin-state</b> and its ethnic brethren may be weakened despite the existence of extreme insecurity...|$|E
40|$|Special legal {{provisions}} on preferential treatment of expatriates introduced during last decade by the <b>kin-states</b> are oftentimes construed by the scholars as visible sings and effective tools of new, post-territorial nation-building in Eastern Europe. However, {{the analysis of}} Serbian and Kosovan laws on citizenship and diaspora shows that the picture is more complex, whereas the situation varies across countries of the region. Despite the rising concerns with {{the issues of the}} co-ethnics since late 2000 the Serbian government for some years has been reluctant to introduce the exclusive preferential treatment for the Serbs in the realm of citizenship. Only the law passed in 2009 overtly showed that the executives and legislators of the Republic of Serbia now are on the way of creating post-territorial Serb national community. Contrariwise the political establishment of Kosovo equally pushing forward special laws on “diaspora ” in 2008 and 2011 was rather concerned with forming and reasserting of as well as tightening its grip over post-territorial citizenry because of notable social and economic problems. In contrast to Easter European status laws, trans-border “ethnic relatives ” of the Kosovan majority are effectively excluded by the documents from the membership in the “diaspora, ” while the representatives of ethnic minorities from the territory of the country legally qualify for being Kosovo diasporans...|$|R
40|$|Ethnonationalist Conflict in Postcommunist States investigates {{why some}} Eastern European states transitioned to {{new forms of}} {{governance}} with minimal violence while others broke into civil war. In Bulgaria, the Turkish minority was subjected to coerced assimilation and forced expulsion, but the nation ultimately negotiated peace through institutional channels. In Macedonia, periodic outbreaks of insurgent violence escalated to armed conflict. Kosovo's internal warfare culminated in NATO's controversial bombing campaign. In the twenty-first century, these conflicts were subdued, but violence continued to flare occasionally and impede durable conflict resolution. In this comparative study, Maria Koinova applies historical institutionalism to conflict analysis, tracing ethnonationalist violence in postcommunist states to a volatile, formative period between 1987 and 1992. In this era of instability, the incidents that brought majorities and minorities into dispute {{had a profound impact}} and a cumulative effect, as did the interventions of international agents and kin states. Whether the conflicts initially evolved in peaceful or violent ways, the dynamics of their disputes became self-perpetuating and informally institutionalized. Thus, external policies or interventions could affect only minimal change, and the impact of international agents subsided over time. Regardless of the constitutions, laws, and injunctions, majorities, minorities, international agents, and kin states continue to act in accord with the logic of informally institutionalized conflict dynamics. Koinova analyzes the development of those dynamics in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Kosovo, drawing on theories of democratization, international intervention, and path-dependence as well as interviews and extensive fieldwork. The result is a compelling account of the underlying causal mechanisms of conflict perpetuation and change that will shed light on broader patterns of ethnic violence.

40|$|Objective This article investigates what kin {{identification}} means from a bottom-up perspective in two kin majority cases: Moldova and Crimea. Methods The {{article is based}} on ∼ 50 fieldwork interviews conducted in both Moldova and Crimea with everyday social actors (2012 – 2013). Results Ethnic homogeneity for kin majorities is more fractured that previously considered. Respondents identified more in terms of assemblages of ethnic, cultural, political, linguistic, and territorial identities than in mutually exclusive census categories. Conclusions To understand fully the relations between kin majorities, their <b>kin-state</b> and home-state and the impact of growing kin engagement policies, like dual citizenship, it is necessary to analyze the complexities of the lived experience of kin identification for members of kin majorities and how this relates to <b>kin-state</b> identification and affiliation. Understanding these complexities helps to have a more nuanced understanding of the role of ethnicity in post-Communist societies, in terms of <b>kin-state</b> and intrastate relations...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of why individuals vote, the so-called “paradox of voting”, has been a crucial debate within political science, conceived deductively as an interaction between costs, benefits, and, as some argue, duties. This article situates the {{question of}} why individuals vote within the context of extra-territorial elections, focusing on how and why those who acquire citizenship kin-states participate in <b>kin-state</b> elections following citizenship acquisition, while continuing to reside outside of the <b>kin-state.</b> The article uses the case of newly acquired Romanian citizens in Moldova, who have never resided in nor intend to reside in Romania, to unpack whether, how, and why individuals acquiring Romanian citizenship in Moldova vote in Romanian elections. The article uses an interpretive and inductive approach to explore from the bottom up both the experiences of and motivations for political participation of extra-territorial citizens. The article finds, unexpectedly, how those acquiring Romanian citizenship in Moldova are motivated by a duty to participate. Overall, the article argues for a relational and reciprocal understanding of citizenship and voting, which focuses on the relationship between the <b>kin-state,</b> facilitating citizenship as a right, and the kin-citizen, performing their duty to vote...|$|E
40|$|The {{conflicts}} and wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Nagorno Karabakh are commonly viewed {{as little more}} than the expression of <b>kin-state</b> involvement. The Serbian regime is usually assigned overwhelming influence over the local Serb leaders, and the formal division between Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh is frequently argued to be a smokescreen. However, this article argues that the leaders in Belgrade and Yerevan were not always able to control the local leaders and dictate developments, and their influence varied considerably in different conflict phases. Even though <b>kin-state</b> involvement can play a very important role, and indeed be the decisive factor in a violent conflict, the potentially limited longevity of these ethnonational ties should be acknowledged; they can be weakened even in a situation of extreme insecurity and this impacts on the possibility for reaching a settlement...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. [...] . <b>kin-state</b> {{activism}} in Central and Eastern Europe has increased despite a substantive improvement of minority rights in most societies {{in this region}} {{and the fact that}} most Central and Eastern European societies are now either part of the EU (or expect to join in the near future). The purpose of our paper is to advance the understanding of this phenomenon. First, we outline the types of <b>kin-state</b> strategies that have emerged as popular in the region, with a particular focus on benefit laws and citizenship laws. We then turn to an analysis of the Hungarian case, which has been seemingly the most consistent and coherent virtual nationalism policy as well as the most controversial one, attracting a great degree of attention from policy-makers in the region, European officials, and scholars of nationalism. Finally, to gain further insight into the differences on the spectrum of virtual nationalism, we discuss the strategies pursued by Romania and Russia...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the conditions under}} which ethno-territorial cross-border conflicts can be resolved successfully. Ethno-territorial cross-border conflict is a type of ethnic conflict in which competing territorial and ethnic claims of distinct state and group actors occur; and this manifests itself primarily on three interrelated levels - inter-group conflict, conflict between the external minority and the institutions of its host-state, and the (territorial) conflict between host- and <b>kin-state.</b> An initial theoretical exploration of the subject establishes the framework of the subsequent study of individual cases, examining why the similar conflicts in Alsace, the Saarland, South Tyrol, and Northern Ireland required fundamentally different solutions. In addition to this, the condominia of Andorra and the New Hebrides are analysed, providing the basis upon which the concept of a condominium-style settlement for ethno-territorial cross- border conflicts is explored. By looking at the workings of integration, traditional consociation and consociation with permanent institutionalised <b>kin-state</b> involvement, secession, and condominium, the complexity of factors is studied that influence the development of ethno- territorial cross-border conflict, including inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic dimensions and the policies of the host and <b>kin-state</b> in relation to the conflict and each other. Thus refined, the analytical framework allows determining the conditions that must be fulfilled to provide lasting stability to a negotiated settlement. This set of stability criteria creates a paradigm that has relevance as an analytical tool beyond the case studies conducted in this thesis. It can be used to design case-specific solutions to actual ethnic conflicts and it can serve as an instrument to recognise instabilities in, and potential breakdowns of, existing settlements sufficiently early to respond to them constructively and to avoid a re-escalation of an already settled conflict...|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} bottom–up, people-centered {{research}} which uses ethnographic and everyday approaches is crucial but underutilized {{in research on}} identity politics in Eastern Europe. In order to understand what concepts such as ethnicity and citizenship mean {{in the context of}} people’s everyday lives, it is vital to understand whether takenfor- granted political concepts are appropriate and the make-up of data such as census data. The article first introduces the methods of political ethnography and bottom–up interviews by discussing how they can be applied and their value within political science. The paper uses data gathered from interviews in Moldova and Crimea (when it was still a de jure and de facto part of Ukraine) to demonstrate the value of this approach. It shows how interview data can add significantly to the understanding of <b>kin-state</b> relations within political science by adding a richness of context and a bottom–up perspective that quantitative and elite-level interviews fail to provide. Lastly, the paper draws on experiences gained from research design to discuss how bottom–up research in political science can be conducted rigorously. The article argues that this approach can deepen the understanding of identity politics and <b>kin-state</b> relations or, more broadly, important post-communist questions such as democratization and Europeanization...|$|E
40|$|Hungarian {{minority}} {{languages are}} spoken in seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Slovakia, Ukraine (Sub-Carpathian region), Romania (Transylvania), Serbia (Vojvodina), Croatia (Slavonia), Slovenia (Mura region) and Austria (Burgenland). In {{most of these}} countries and regions the Hungarian language counts {{a substantial number of}} speakers and all these countries and regions are neighbouring the <b>kin-state</b> Hungary. In the <b>kin-state,</b> the Hungarian language is the official language of the state. Due to twentieth century’s totalitarian and nationalist ideologies the Hungarian minority languages were discriminated. After the collapse of the communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe {{at the beginning of the}} nineties of the past century the Hungarian minority languages have gained official status in the countries and/or regions they are spoken in. The concrete rights the Hungarian minority languages are granted however vary enormously, from ousting Hungarian from the official domains as in Slovakia to granting the Hungarian language a status as one of the official languages, such as in the Autonomous Province (AP) of Vojvodina. Despite these differences, we observe the resiliencing of the Hungarian minority languages in the so-called Carpathian Macroregion. In the heart of Europe, the Hungarian language functions in fact as a transnational regional vernacular language that has the potential of becoming a regional vehicular language. The resiliencing of the Hungarian minority languages in the Carpathian Macroregion also boosts multilingual and transnational communication. In this paper, it will be argued that this process is strongly supported by the Europeanization of Central and Eastern Europe. The paper concludes with a general outlook on the position of minority languages in the post-Lisbon European Union...|$|E

Focusing on the case of the Hungarian Status Law, this article problematizes identity recognition as a kin-state’s responsibility, examining its legitimacy, place and limits in liberal multiculturalism. Against the current consensus in liberal multiculturalism, I argue that, although the primary responsibility for identity recogni-tion lies with the home-state, a <b>kin-state</b> can complement the home-state’s duties...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the {{communist}} regime in the early 1990 s, Albania has experienced {{one of the most significant}} emigrations in the world as a share of its population. By 2010 almost half of its resident population was estimated to be living abroad – primarily in neighbouring Greece and Italy, but also in the UK and North America. This chapter discusses the emergence and establishment of the Albanian diaspora, its temporal and geographical diversity, and not least its involvement with Albania itself. Albania’s policymaking and key institutions are considered, with a focus on matters of citizenship; voting rights; the debate on migration and development; and not least the complex ways in which <b>kin-state</b> minority policies – related to ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo, Montenegro, southern Serbia, Macedonia and Greece – are interwoven with Albania’s emigration policies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{diaspora}} framework {{as a useful}} way of conceptualizing {{the relationship between the}} <b>kin-state</b> and northern Irish nationalists. The formation of diasporas is generally understood as being a consequence of migration. People migrate across borders and construct communities in their host states while maintaining a strong sense of linkage with the nation’s homeland. The homeland is central to diaspora. However, homelands are political constructs the parameters of which fluctuate. I argue that members of the northern nationalist community are outside the political homeland of their Irish co-ethnics as a result of boundary drawing rather than emigration. The paper highlights the rapidity with which the southern political elite consolidated southern statehood reflecting and further reinforcing a clear sense of north-south differentiation. Decades of divergent state building has further reinforced the relevance of the boundary in terms of southern ethnic identity, further emphasizing the rhetorical nature of calls of re-unification...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{engagement with}} Russias Compatriot policy, {{as an example}} of ethnizenship-type of quasi-citizenship, in Crimea, as the most likely case of Compatriot engagement. The article focuses on unpacking the lived experience of Compatriot identification and engagement and the rationale for this engagement. The article finds a narrow and niche engagement with the Compatriot policy in Crimea where only the most politicized and discriminated individuals, alongside beneficiaries of the Compatriot policy, identify as Compatriots. However, the article also finds dissatisfaction with the Compatriot policy because it fails to offer the kind of status, and rights and benefits, of full citizenship. Thus, while citizenship might be becoming fractured, via quasi-citizenship policies, citizenship remains the key point of entry to the <b>kin-state.</b> Focusing on the lived experience of quasi-citizenship, and examining quasi-citizenship as a category of practice, is crucial for developing understanding of the social and political impacts of quasi-citizenship policies...|$|E
40|$|Albania and Turkey {{did not act}} in overtly irredentist ways {{towards their}} ethnic brethren in {{neighboring}} states {{after the end of}} communism. Why, nonetheless, did Albania facilitate the increase of ethnic conflict in Kosovo and Macedonia, while Turkey did not, with respect to the Turks of Bulgaria? I argue that kin-states undergoing transition are more prone to intervene in external conflicts than states that are not, regardless of the salience of minority demands in the host-state. The transition weakens the institutions of the <b>kin-state.</b> Experiencing limited institutional constraints, self-seeking state officials create alliances with secessionist and autonomist movements across borders alongside their own ideological, clan-based and particularistic interests. Such alliances are often utilized to advance radical domestic agendas. Unlike in Albania's transition environment, in Turkey there were no emerging elites that could potentially form alliances and use external movements to legitimize their own domestic existence or claims.

40|$|Treatment of {{nationals}} {{by their}} kin state deals with what legal science amuses itself to call “concepts à géometrie variable” or even “non-identifiable objects” (Horchani, 2003, pp. 189). To the date {{there is no}} broadly accepted definition {{of the concept of}} nationalities or national minorities and, in order to identify a <b>kin-state,</b> one needs to clarify the concept of nation, which remains a challenge even in postmodern era (Toperwien, 2001, pp. 44, 187 - 189). Postmodern writings have criticized modern definitions of the concept of nation as relying too heavily on objective criteria and neglecting a possible more subjective approach. Also, globalization might necessitate a new concept of nation. No attempt to provide formal definitions will be attempted in this article, but some explanations regarding the use of words and concepts are deemed necessary before sketching some features of history in order to venture understanding the treatment that the state reserves to Romanians living abroad...|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} expectations, the {{accession}} of eight East European countries to the European Union in 2004 {{did not sound}} the death knoll of nationalism in the region; rather, it signalled its reinvention and, in some respects, reinvigoration. In this paper, we combine perspectives from political science and sociology to examine three ways in which nationalism is accommodating itself in its new European home {{in two of the}} EU’s newest member states: Hungary and Poland. First is the reconfiguration of the left-right political spectrum in the region along an axis of national(ist) versus non-national(ist). The broad consensus on the desirability (if not inevitability) of European unification has had the effect of lessening the importance of traditional left-right party identifications. In its place, the ‘nation’ has provided a convenient fulcrum for interparty contestation. This has not manifested itself as the virulent nationalism of the early 1990 s but rather a ‘softer’ version that serves to distinguish those political parties claiming to represent ‘the nation’ and those who, by extension, do not. This softer nationalism is characterized by the tendency of political parties to recalibrate non-national issues as national ones. Second, we examine the instrumental use of European discourses and institutions to accomplish the nationalist aims of <b>kin-state</b> politics (often inconsistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of those EU discourses and institutions). EU integration has provided nationalists in the region with a ‘backdoor’ for realising old nationalist ambitions - albeit in a postmodern way. This isn’t national reunification through territorial revision, but rather symbolic national reunification across the porous borders of the EU’s newest member states. EU integration has opened up a political space for the elaboration and reinvigoration of <b>kin-state</b> politics. If these first two trends represent a taming of nationalism in the pursuit of more symbolic goals, the third nationalist trend we identify points to the radicalisation of nationalism in the pursuit of more practical goals. Here in the third part of our paper we turn to the emergence and strengthening of radical nationalist organisations outside of the political establishment in Hungary and Poland. Concomitant with the marginalisation of certain far rightwing elements operating {{within the framework of the}} established political system in these countries, we pay witness to the renewed appeal of extra-political nationalist groups. For these groups, the threat does not come from without but from within: Roma, Jews and sexual minorities, among others. It is our contention that the taming of mainstream nationalism has contributed to the unleashing of these more virulent forms of nationalism operating outside of established political constraints. Together, these three developments signal important changes in the trajectory of nationalism in Hungary and Poland. Our examination links these changes not only to the domestic political culture of Hungary and Poland but also to the institutional and discursive constraints of the European Union. Therefore, this paper would fit best into the conference’s panel on ‘Globalisation and the emergence of new forms of nationalism’. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{incorporate}} {{the study of}} diasporas into international relations (IR) theory by focusing on diasporas as independent actors who actively influence their homeland (<b>kin-state)</b> foreign policies. We argue that diasporic influences can best be understood by situating them in the theoretical space shared by constructivism and liberalism; two approaches that acknowledge the impact of identity and domestic politics on international behavior. We also maintain that the exploration of diasporic activities can enrich both constructivism and liberalism. First, diasporas identity-based motivations should {{be an integral part}} of the constructivist effort to explain the formation of national identities. Second, diasporic activities and influences in their homelands expand the meaning of the term domestic politics to include not only politics inside the state but also inside the people. For the liberal approach, this is a new fact in the Lakatosian sense of the word. We theorize that the extent of diasporic influence on homeland foreign policy is determined by three components that make up the balance of power between homelands and diasporas. We then test this theory by delving into the interaction between the newly established state of Armenia and its powerful diaspora, and by comparing this case with examples taken from the relations between Israel and diaspora Jews. We would like to thank the editor and the reviewers for their detailed and insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript. Andrew Benett, Aharon Kleiman, Robert Lieber, and Tamara Wittes have contributed greatly to the shaping of our arguments. Barry Bristman and Julie Weise made valuable remarks on content and style. Finally, we thank Khachig T l lyan for sharing with us his unparalleled insights into the Armenian experience. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} this dissertation is to explore whether and how "Europeanization" is an effective Conflict Resolution mechanism to produce sustainable solutions to cross-border ethno-nationalist conflicts at {{the periphery of the}} European Union, namely the Western Balkans. Accepting "Europeanization" as "an analytical concept used to examine the changes in domestic structures and policies that occur in response to policies and practices institutionalized at the European level" three levels of analysis will be explored: (a) the protection of minorities in the domestic legislative level, and (b) the resolution of inter-ethnic conflicts {{as a result of this}} democratization; and (c) whether this "Europeanization" at domestic level, namely adopting the norms of minority protection in the domestic level fosters a cooperation between the host-state and the neighbouring kin state as the neo-functional theories on European integration proposed. In other words, would "internal Europeanization" foster "external Europeanization" in the Western Balkans? In order to assess the impact of "Europeanization" and evaluate the efficiency of these policies on the resolution of ethno-territorial cross-border conflicts which lie at the core of the antagonisms in this region of Western Balkans, three cases will be analysed all of which are centered on the question of "external minority", that is "an ethnic group that, while residing in one state (the host-state) is related through shared cultural, religious or linguistic characteristics, which it wishes to preserve, and through kinship to the titular nation of another, often neighbouring state (the <b>kin-state).</b> These are the Albanian question in Western Macedonia; the Serbian question in Eastern Slavonia, Croatia; and the Hungarian Question in Vojvodina, Serbia and Montenegro...|$|E
40|$|The article aims {{to analyze}} the Hungarian law {{entitled}} "Hungarians living in the neighboring countries. " The law was established in June 2001 to influence the "status" of the Hungarian Kin-minorities living in neighboring countries through providing "positively discriminatory" instruments, such as Hungarian certificates, work permission in <b>kin-state</b> Hungary, and various benefits and grants including scholarships, subsidies, free transportation in Hungary, and so on. The Status law was widely criticized for its instrumental inadequacy by the opposition in the domestic political arena, for its revisionist appearance by the other East European countries, and for its provoking conflicts with the neighboring countries by the European community. From a legal aspect, it was also blamed for extraterritoriality, however, the law, in turn, could be challenging enough to induce controversies over the relationship between nationality and citizenship in a nation-state. Another perspective of the Status law controversy was that of "Meso-areas. " Namely, Meso-areas are changing regional identities, and the law can be {{a product of the}} East European Meso-area, because Hungary was not the only country which established legislation concerning a kin-minority abroad; among other similar legislations, including, for example, the Resolution of the Slovenian Parliament on the status and situation of the Slovenian minorities living in neighboring countries and the duties of the Slovenian State and other bodies in this respect (27 June, 1996); the Act on Expatriate Slovaks and changing and complementing some laws (14 February, 1997); Public Order of 15 - 29 April, 1998, on the Conditions, Duration and Procedure for the delivery of a Special Identity Card to Albanian citizens of Greek origin; the Law regarding the support granted to the Romanian communities {{from all over the world}} (15 July, 1998); and the Law for the Bulgarians living outside the Republic of Bulgaria (11 April, 2000). The article focuses, however, not only on these aspects but also on the context of the nation-building policies carried by the FIDESZ government led by Viktor Orban from 1998 to 2002. The Status law was, eventually, a significant and finishing part of its "national policies" which began with the law aiming at the restoration of the Hungarian Crown of St. Istvan, adapted by the Hungarian Parliament in the end of 1999 and implemented on the first day of the third millennium, 1 st January, 2000. The pre-history of the Status law was, though starting in 1980 s in the long run, directly the kin-minority policy of the Hungarian Democratic Forum government from 1991 to 1994, the first post-communist government in Hungary. The premier, Jozsef Antall declared that his government was not only that of the Republic of Hungary, but also for the 15 millions of Hungarians. This sounded almost like a revisionist ambition to the ears of the neighboring countries. Hungary was, although having no territorial or border change requirements against them, headed for not a civic society formation but a new nation building through the integration of the kin-minorities living in the surrounding "nationalizing states. " In this context, Hungary was also a nationalizing <b>kin-state</b> as many other East European countries. It is common sense in Eastern Europe that almost all countries in the region prescribed a phrase in their Constitution, which explicitly address their responsibility to their kin-minorities abroad, and many of the countries actually established legislations to realize the Constitutional obligation that we have mentioned above. In this context, the Orban government was, first of all, the logical successor of the Antall cabinet. The successor was, however, not a simply reproduced one, but a multi-faced descendant, because the FIDESZ government had to accommodate their new nation building policy into another fundamental policy, that is accession for EU membership. In other words, their nation building should be consistent with the EU integration as well as their doctrines. In this perspective, the premier, V. Orban, and his government had emphasized their nation building as a contribution for realizing "borderless Europe," namely an organic part of the supra-national EU integration. St. Istvan, the first king of Hungary, and the Crown was, according to the FIDESZ interpretation, the national symbol of Hungarian participation into the European integration in Christianity in the Medieval Age, and the Hungarian national community, integrating its kin-minorities over the state borders, could be a part of the new "European community of the communities. " The article draws a comprehensive picture of the Hungarian Status Law, beginning with the concept of "national policy" of the Orban government and ending with its failure via the regional and European controversies over the law...|$|E
40|$|Transnational Citizenship is a puzzling concept if {{we think}} about {{citizenship}} as a relation between an individual, a state and the other citizens of that state. However, such a view of citizenship is no longer adequate {{in a world where}} states have become interdependent and where large numbers of individuals move across their borders. Responses of liberal democratic states to migration have created new statuses and rights of citizenship across international borders, multiple nationality is increasingly common and significant numbers of people engage in social and political practices of citizenship over long distances or participate locally without being recognized as citizens of the country where they reside. This collection of mostly classic and some less well-known essays focuses on the historical question whether transnational citizenship is a genuinely new phenomenon and the normative question how it can be reconciled with principles of equal status and rights of citizens. The book opens with a introductory essay on the concept and the academic debates it has triggered. Its nineteen other chapters are grouped into five sections focusing on historical trends, institutional change, shifting boundaries, transnationalism from below and inter-state relations. The book combines multiple disciplinary perspectives and sets the most important authors in dialogue with each other. It will provide very useful teaching material for courses on migration and citizenship in different academic disciplines at graduate and postgraduate level.
