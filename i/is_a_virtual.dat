The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic {{and play the}} respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini.

5|$|The next case {{given to}} Sam and Max {{involves}} {{dealing with a}} computer crisis that is causing the world economy to collapse. They discover the problem <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> reality program called Reality 2.0, powered by the Internet (which has gained sentience), which is hypnotizing people so they never {{want to leave the}} program. Sam and Max access the program themselves and introduce a computer virus that crashes Reality 2.0 and deletes the digital embodiment of the Internet. Prior to expiring, the Internet reveals that it was following the plans of one Roy G. Biv. Sam eventually deduces that Roy G. Biv is actually Hugh Bliss, a character seemingly in the background of all their previous cases. The Freelance Police travel to Bliss' Prismatology retreat on the Moon, where Bliss is preparing a device to hypnotize the entire planet. Bliss reveals himself as a colony of sentient bacteria that feeds off of the endorphins produced by human happiness; by hypnotizing the planet, Bliss assures himself of a permanent supply of nourishment. Bliss activates the device, but is killed when Sam tricks him into a tank of water and boils it using the rocket engine of a lunar lander. Returning to Earth, Max takes great pleasure in reversing the hypnotism by personally knocking everyone on the planet unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Electron guns facing ring axis. These shoot {{electrons}} {{into the}} center of the ring structure. Once inside, the electrons are confined by the magnetic fields. This has been measured in polywells using Langmuir probes. Electrons that have enough energy to escape through the magnetic cusps can be re-attracted to the positive rings. They can slow down and return to the inside of the rings along the cusps. This reduces conduction losses, and improves the overall performance of the machine. The electrons act as a negative voltage drop attracting positive ions. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> cathode.|$|E

MoarVM <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> machine built {{especially}} for Rakudo Perl 6 and the NQP Compiler Toolchain.

Large portions of Rakudo are written in Perl 6 itself, or in its subset NQP. Rakudo is not a completely self-hosting implementation, nor are there concrete plans at this point to make Rakudo a bootstrapping compiler.|$|E
25|$|Windows XP Mode (XPM) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>virtual</b> machine {{package for}} Windows Virtual PC {{containing}} a pre-installed, licensed copy of Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 as its guest OS.

Pre-installed integration components allow applications running within the virtualized environment to appear as if running directly on the host, sharing the native desktop and start menu of Windows 7 as well as participating in file type associations. Windows XP Mode applications run in a Terminal Services session in the virtualized Windows XP, and are accessed via Remote Desktop Protocol by a client running on the Windows 7 host.|$|E
