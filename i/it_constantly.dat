The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on <b>it</b> <b>constantly.</b> Lazenby and Rigg did most of the driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
5|$|Gimbal: The gimbal {{is known}} as the 'Cardan' {{suspension}} after Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), yet it was known long before him. The British scientist Joseph Needham writes that the earliest confirmed use of gimbals in Europe is the 9th century recipe book Little Key of Painting and Belgian chemist and historian of science Mappae clavicula, which mentioned a vase surrounded by rings which allowed it to be undisturbed when in a rolling motion. Needham and BGeorge Sarton both write that an Arabic translation—dated to roughly the era of Al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833)—of an ancient Greek work now lost (i.e. Pneumatica) by 3rd-century BC Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280– c. 220 BC) contains a description of gimbals used to support an inkpot that could wet a pen on any of its sides, yet Needham suspects Arabic interpolation and doubts total authenticity, while Sarton asserts {{that for the most part}} the Arabic translation is faithful to Philo's lost original, hence Philo should be credited with the invention of the gimbal. Around 180 AD, the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) inventor and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) — who also created a rotary fan and zoetrope lamp—invented a 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions', or 'Bedclothes Censer'. This incense burner had a series of metal rings which could be moved in any direction while the burner in the middle remained constantly level. This is the first clear reference in China of the gimbal, although there is a hint in the writing of Sima Xiangru (179–117 BC) that this device existed in the 2nd century BC (i.e., 'the metal rings burning perfume'). The gimbal incense burner is mentioned in subsequent dynasties, while silverwork specimens of gimbal incense burners from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) still exist. In the Liang Dynasty (502–557) there is mention of gimbals used in hinges for doors and windows, while an unnamed artisan presented a warming stove to Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690–705) in 692 which employed gimbals to keep <b>it</b> <b>constantly</b> balanced.|$|E

25|$|Guidance is {{performed}} by the target tracking radar, <b>it</b> <b>constantly</b> relays target range, elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and {{on the basis of}} this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8× magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead weighs about 9kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600mm long, 6 to 9mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 2–3grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 2–3grams. The 9K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).|$|E

500|$|Both {{continuity}} and discontinuity are {{emphasized in the}} text of the Cylinder. It asserts the virtue of Cyrus as a gods-fearing king of a traditional Mesopotamian type. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>constantly</b> discredits Nabonidus, reviling the deposed king's deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people. As Fowler and Hekster note, this [...] "creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating the 'symbolic capital' of his predecessors." [...] The Cylinder's reprimand of Nabonidus also discredits Babylonian royal authority by association. It is perhaps for this reason that the Achaemenid rulers made greater use of Assyrian rather than Babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations; the Cylinder refers to the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal as [...] "my predecessor", rather than any native Babylonian ruler.|$|E

500|$|Marx's view of {{capitalism}} was two-sided.

Marx considered the capitalist class {{to be one of the}} most revolutionary in history because <b>it</b> <b>constantly</b> improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism and its transition to capitalism.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Tolkien {{decided that the}} proto-{{language}} of the Elves was Valarin, the tongue of the gods or Valar as he called them: [...] "The language of the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar, but they changed it even in the learning, and moreover modified and enriched <b>it</b> <b>constantly</b> at all times by their own invention." [...] In the Comparative Tables the mechanisms of sound change were described by Tolkien for the following daughter languages: Qenya, Lindarin (a dialect of Qenya), Telerin, Old Noldorin (or Fëanorian), Noldorin (or Gondolinian), Ilkorin (especially of Doriath), Danian of Ossiriand, East Danian, Taliska, West Lemberin, North Lemberin, and East Lemberin. For this proto-language of the Elves, Tolkien appears to have borrowed the five-part plosive system of Proto-Indo-European, the ancestor of Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and others; namely, one labial, one coronal, and three velar plosives (palatal, plain, and labial).
