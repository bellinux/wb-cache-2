25|$|Attlee and Bevin worked {{together}} on the decision to produce a British atomic bomb, despite intense opposition from pro-Soviet elements of the Labour Party, a group Bevin detested. The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, that 'We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this thing over here whatever it costs … We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.' It {{was a matter of}} both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.|$|E
500|$|The {{passage of}} the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that}} the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, [...] "That won't do at all... we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this... I don't mind for myself, but I don't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as I have just had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this thing over here whatever it costs... We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the bloody Union Jack on top of it." ...|$|E

Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of The Ziegfeld Follies. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this.

His {{participation}} in the nine-day mission was criticized by some members of the space community as a favor granted by Clinton; John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space-policy project, said: [...] "If he was a normal person, he would acknowledge he's a great American hero and that he should get to fly on the shuttle for free...

Field explained his thought process on the film trailer: [...] "A trailer, is like a one-minute or whatever, mini movie that's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its own feeling and form to it— trailer music is very intense and gets right to the point. It sounds simple, but it's taken me some years to really figure out.

500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E

500|$|Vernon {{remained}} {{among the}} NHL leaders in wins the following seasons, finishing 6th in 1989–90 with 23 and 2nd in 1990–91 with 31. He was voted {{to the starting}} lineup for both the 1990 and 1991 All-Star Games via fan balloting. He served as the backup goaltender for Team Canada at the 1991 World Championship, and though he lost both games he appeared in, Vernon and the Canadians won the silver medal. Despite his success with the Flames, Vernon was often criticized for letting in weak goals, and was routinely booed by the fans in Calgary when he did so. Some fans chose to direct insults towards his family in the stands, causing his parents to stop attending games. Discussing his relationship with Flames fans later in his career, Vernon remarked: [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a pretty thick skin to play goal. Fans at hockey games get very emotional. They're very passionate. They don't enjoy watching their team give up goals." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E

500|$|Vachss said [...] "writing is {{my way of}} preaching. For me, it's always, {{always the}} message. The plot is {{something}} I contrive to deliver the message. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, but if you can give them an exciting story, you can always make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E

She grew up spoilt and sheltered {{from the real}} world, which made her {{a force to be}} reckoned with as soon as she was old enough to break free of her father's influence." [...] Carmella underwent many changes during her tenure. Blair initially described her as a [...] "fun, feisty and foxy sort of character". However, Carmella became depressed through her life's travails, having been stalked by Frank Romano, sold her cousin Teresa's baby and subsequently become a nun. Before her official confirmation in the convent, Carmella goes clubbing with ex-boyfriend Connor. Desrcibing Carmella's reasoning, Blair stated: [...] "Carmella is thinking, 'Is what I'm about to go ahead with, - becoming a nun - the right choice?' She wants to be sure she's making the right decision about what she'll do for the rest of her life." [...] Blair confirmed that after that night Carmella had [...] "all the answers that she needed" [...] to live the rest of her life. Blair enjoyed the opportunity to play a nun, but was glad when the storyline concluded as it meant Carmella <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun again.|$|E
