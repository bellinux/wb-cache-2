5|$|At the 1933 elections, the Rhodesia Party was {{defeated}} by the Reform Party of Godfrey Huggins. Guest was a key advocate of accepting the merger of the two parties under the new name of the United Party and Huggins appointed him to <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet</b> in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Following his election, O'Malley's first {{personnel}} {{decision was}} {{to retain the}} director of the city's economic development agency. O'Malley had his transition team, and had them compile policy drafts by mid-December, so they would be ready to compete for state funds when the Maryland State Legislature reconvened on January 12, 2000. He participated in the Newly Elected Mayors Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in mid-November. By the beginning of December, he named five deputy mayors and filled most of <b>his</b> <b>cabinet.</b> He finalized <b>his</b> <b>cabinet</b> on December 7, during his last session as a city councillor. He was sworn in as mayor later that day at the War Memorial Plaza, near Baltimore City Hall.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{appointed}} {{a number of}} well-regarded figures to <b>his</b> <b>cabinet,</b> including Andrew Mellon at the Treasury, Herbert Hoover at Commerce and Charles Evans Hughes at the State Department. A major foreign policy achievement came with the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922, in which the world's major naval powers agreed on a naval limitations program that lasted a decade. Two members of <b>his</b> <b>cabinet</b> were implicated in corruption: Interior Secretary Albert Fall and Attorney General Harry Daugherty. The resulting scandals did not fully emerge until after Harding's death, nor did word of his extramarital affairs, but both greatly damaged his reputation. Harding {{died of a heart}} attack in San Francisco while on a western speaking tour; he was succeeded by his vice president, Calvin Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a 2005 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning American {{historian}} Doris Kearns Goodwin, {{published by}} Simon & Schuster. The {{book is a}} biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{and some of the}} men who served with him in <b>his</b> <b>cabinet</b> from 1861 to 1865. Three of <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet</b> members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election: Attorney General Edward Bates, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase and Secretary of State William H. Seward. The book focuses on Lincoln's mostly successful attempts to reconcile conflicting personalities and political factions on the path to abolition and victory in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating <b>his</b> <b>cabinet</b> selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E

50|$|The Cabinet Schröder II was {{the state}} {{government}} of the German state of Lower Saxony from 23 June 1994 until 30 March 1998. It was headed by Gerhard Schröder, preceded by <b>his</b> first <b>cabinet</b> (1990-1994) and briefly succeeded by <b>his</b> third <b>cabinet</b> (1998).|$|R
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to <b>his</b> <b>cabinet,</b> Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to <b>his</b> <b>cabinet.</b> McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker's disinclination to make {{concessions}} to Quebec, along with {{the disintegration of the}} Union Nationale, the failure of the Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebecers to <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> none to senior positions, all led to an erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.|$|E

5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793. In it he declared the United States neutral {{in the conflict}} between Great Britain and France. He also threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance {{to any of the}} warring countries. Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the People Power Revolution and the {{installation}} to the presidency of Corazon Aquino, Ople was relieved of <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet</b> post.

Nonetheless in May 1986, Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Garfield placated the Stalwarts by {{endorsing}} Chester A.

Blaine accepted, resigning from the Senate on March 4, 1881.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was, for {{all intents}} and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia.

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet</b> appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most of the party had not {{originally}} supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} British politics, the {{declaration}} {{resulted from the}} coming into power of Lloyd George and <b>his</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> which had replaced the H. H. Asquith led-Cabinet in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were Liberals and both governments were wartime coalitions, Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had favoured its reform.|$|E

Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.|$|E
