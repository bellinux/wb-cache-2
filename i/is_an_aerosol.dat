Data were checked by robust comparisons with other experimental data (particle number, sunphotometer-derived derived data). We found the presence of two accumulation modes in different internal mixing and optical calculations show that the Beijing aerosol single scattering albedo (ωo # 0. 90) is significantly higher than expected.

New particle formation <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>aerosol</b> particle source and, to date, its contribution to the total aerosol concentration in the atmosphere is not fully understood. This study focuses on the extension of new particle formation events that begin in Lille Valby, Denmark and travel over 70 km to Vavihill, Sweden. Data over a five year period (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010) was analyzed.

If the result is extrapolated to all wind directions and sources, it is likely that a much higher percentage of the days would meet the criteria.

40|$|Black carbon (BC) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>aerosol</b> {{material}} {{produced by}} incomplete combustion {{of fossil fuels}} and biomass. BC {{has been shown to}} be the second most important anthropogenic climate warming agent after carbon dioxide due to its ability to absorb solar radiation, influence cloud behavior, and accelerate snow melt. BC in otherwise clean snow can significantly reduce its reflectivity. In order to learn about the significance of BC contamination in snow, we explored the deposition of BC onto snow and the transport of BC in snow during snowmelt. A Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP 2), was used to measure the concentration and size distribution of BC in an airstream drawn through snow to determine the rate at which the snow trapped BC. BC concentration in meltwater was measured to determine if the BC was left in the snow or was removed during melting. SP 2 testing showed a significant drop in BC aerosol concentration after contact with the snow. This implies that naturally occurring snow is a highly efficient absorber of BC from the atmosphere. Meltwater samples had a lower BC concentration than the snow, suggesting that the majority of the BC is left behind in snow during partial melting. This accumulation of BC could potentially cause a positive feedback to the rate of snowmelt. Better understanding the behavior of BC in snow will help scientists describe the impact of BC on climate and help policymakers predict the benefits of reducing BC emissions...|$|E
