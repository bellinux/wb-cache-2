5|$|In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the {{greatest}} of the Noldor, created the Silmarils in which he stored {{a part of the}} light of the Two Trees that were lighting Valinor. After three ages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Halls</b> of Mandos, Melkor was released, feigning reform. He however spread his evil and started to poison the minds of the Elves against the Valar. Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning and preparation of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of the temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls,</b> stairwell, and {{elevator}}; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables {{of the elevator}} he is in and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Fëanor prized the Silmarils {{above all}} else, and grew {{increasingly}} suspicious that the Valar and other Eldar coveted them.

25|$|In earlier versions, Melkor’s first reign ended {{after the}} Elves, {{the eldest of}} the Children of Ilúvatar, awoke at the shores of Cuiviénen, and the Valar {{resolved}} to rescue them from his malice.

25|$|In Italy, the Lombards then imposed {{themselves}} at first {{as the dominant}} caste {{in place of the}} former lineages, who were subsequently extinguished or exiled.

The proceeds were not given to individuals but to the family, which administered them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> (a term still used in the Italian toponymy). The economic system of late antiquity, which focused on large estates worked by peasants in semi-servile condition, was not revolutionized, but modified only to benefit the new rulers.|$|E

50|$|Similarity {{scores are}} among the many {{original}} sabermetric concepts first introduced by Bill James. James initially created the concept {{as a way to}} effectively compare non-Hall of Fame players to players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> to see who was either on track to make the HOF, or to determine if any eligible players had been snubbed by the selection committee. For example, if the most similar players to a non-HOFer were all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame, one could effectively argue that that player should be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|R

25|$|Clark {{remained}} a respected and influential adviser to various government agencies throughout his {{tenure at the}} university. He was outspoken in matters of timber and natural resource conservation, fiscal responsibility, constitutional and education reform, and especially human rights. He was capable and articulate in framing current policy against the lessons of history and careful to skillfully represent only primary sources whenever possible – a praxis which earned him immense respect, not only in Kentucky and the US, but around the world. His public visibility earned him a name for taking an appreciation of history to the people – not hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls</b> of academia.|$|E

But no Convention member sympathized, they just told the women to return home. Again in May a crowd of 20,000 men and 40,000 women invaded the Convention and even killed a deputy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>halls,</b> but again they {{failed to make the}} Convention take notice of the needs of the lower classes. Instead, the Convention banned women from all political assemblies, and deputies who had solidarized with this insurrection were sentenced to death: such allegiance between parliament and street fighting was no longer tolerated.|$|E
50|$|Using sabermetric {{statistics}} {{there is}} a compelling case for Grich to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame.
