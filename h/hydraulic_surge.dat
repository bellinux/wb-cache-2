40|$|One {{concern of}} the tunnel system is the {{potential}} for hydraulic transients during the tunnel filling process.

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>surges</b> {{are created}} when the {{velocity}} of a fluid suddenly changes and becomes unsteady or transient. Fluctuations in the fluid’s velocity are generated by restrictions like a pump starting/stopping, a valve opening/closing, or a reduction in line size. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>surges</b> can be generated {{within a matter of}} seconds anywhere that the fluid velocity changes and can travel through a pipeline at very high rate of speed, damaging equipment or causing piping failures from overpressurizing. Surge relief systems absorb and limit high-pressure surges, preventing the pressure surge from traveling through the hydraulic system.

In order to analyze {{the influence of the}} steel mesh on the shock wave speed and transient response processes, an improved wave speed formula is proposed by incorporating the equivalent elastic modulus. A field measurement validates the wave speed formula. Moreover, the transient wave propagation and extreme pressures are simulated and compared by the method of characteristics (MOC) for reinforced PE pipes with various steel-mesh densities.

40|$|The Central Queensland University (CQU) and GBG Project Management are collaborating on on-site {{wastewater}} treatment and reuse designs and installations. A design problem encountered has been large variations in wastewater generation volumes {{during the course}} of a calendar year. Treatment systems that are under-sized are susceptible to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>surges</b> that may result in poor effluent treatment. During peak wastewater production times some sites have insufficient land application area for the treated effluent. This paper discusses a concept design for {{wastewater treatment}} and reuse for small islands and presents data for a caravan park that has large seasonal variations in wastewater generation volumes. The caravan park has primary treatment, a CQU designed self-contained recirculatory evapotranspiration channel, a sand and zeolite filter, and a disinfection process.

Microbiological assessment of the treated effluent at the caravan park showed log reductions in the numbers of faecal coliforms and the nutrients, BOD 5, and pH were all within the licence requirements for the system.

The effluent produced at large commercial sites is significantly different to domestic wastewater in regards to constituents and generation patterns. Standard on-site treatment technologies used at large commercial sites may need to be adjusted to ensure water quality performance.

The system included primary clarification and sludge storage facilities, and a 0. 55 m (1. 8 ft) disc diameter, 20. 9 m^ 2 (225 ft^ 2) four-stage rotating disc treatment unit. The test unit was tested at four hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2). Peripheral rotational disc speed was constant at 0. 3 m/s (1. 0 fps) and waste water temperate was 27 °C to 28 °C during the study. 	At hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2) of disc area, the test unit achieved respectively 94 to 82 % overall removal of carbonaceous BOD 5 and 96 to 82 % overall removal of suspended solids when treating degritted raw domestic waste water. This yielded effluent concentrations of 12 to 32 mg/l BOD 5 and 7 to 21 mg/l suspended solids.

When the surge propagates against an adverse slope, it decelerates {{until it becomes}} a stationary hydraulic jump. Both hydraulic jumps and decelerating surges induce some intense turbulent mixing and have some major impact on the sediment transport in natural systems. Herein, a physical investigation was conducted in a relatively large rectangular channel. <b>Hydraulic</b> jumps and <b>surges</b> were generated by the rapid closure of a gate at the channel downstream end. The turbulent shear stresses were measured with high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz sampling rate) in the jump flow. A comparison between the stationary hydraulic jump, hydraulic jump in translation and decelerating surge measurements showed some marked differences in terms of turbulent mixing. The results highlighted some intense mixing beneath the jump front and roller for all configurations. The levels of turbulent stresses were one to two orders of magnitude larger than a critical threshold for sediment motion. The findings provide some insights into the hydraulic jump migration processes in mobile bed channels, and the complex transformation from a moving jump into a stationary jump.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 Global climate changes have seemly caused acerbating impacts on coastal environments {{in terms of}} severe meteorological hazards, such as hurricanes and their induced storm surges, flooding, and heavy precipitation. Recent disasters of these types, such as HurricaneSandy, have afflicted millions in coastal communities and resulted in billion dollars of losses. Given disasters at such scales, field-based reconnaissance has become ever demanding than before. In the context of structural and geotechnical damage inspection, it calls for efficient tools that can analyze coastal structures that take a system modeling approach. Such a system approach should consider structuresthat are subjected {{to a combination of}} extreme forces and changes of boundary conditions, which may include hydrodynamic wave effects, hydraulic buoyancy, debris impact, and foundation scour. The objective of this thesis to develop a rapid tool for assessing the vulnerability of coastal structures subjected to climatic impacts. Similar tools have been widely used in Structural and Earthquake Engineering for design and loss assessment, {{such as the use of}} a fixed oscillator model characterized by a single parameter of Tn (the natural period of the structure). The direct hazardous impacts considered in this thesis are extreme hydraulic forces and local foundation scouring that may ultimately cause failure of coastal structures (i. e. collapse). The criteria of success of this tool emphasize that it should be as simple as the oscillator model in Earthquake Engineering and is parametric in terms of a few key (intrinsic) parameters to model the nonlinear behavior of a structure subjected to <b>hydraulic</b> storm <b>surges</b> and foundations scour. To precede, two research components are conducted. The first is a hypothesis-driven physical modeling experiment, in which a flume-based modeling is conducted to prove that storm surges can attack a structure by simultaneous surging and scouring. In the hydraulic flume, a generic foundation-structure system is placed and is subjected to forced vibration for probing the dynamic properties of the structure model. Test result successfully revealed the formation of foundation scour, the failure of structure, and the progressively modified dynamic characteristics of the soil-structure system. The second, based on the above flume-based evidence, is to computationally model such the failure of building systems in a reduced order subjected to the combined hazards of storm surges and foundation scour. In this thesis, Ibuild afinite-element (FE) based model using Abaqus software. In this model, the structural system response has been resolved from prototype models to simplified dimensionless model consisting of a single degree of freedom (SDOF) oscillator founded on a square foundation. The footing is embedded in near-field soil modeled using inelastic soil under an undrained condition. The two primary intrinsic parameters identified in this thesis. The first is theratio of the vertical foundation load N in comparison with the ultimate vertical capacity Nu, expressed through the ratio χ = N/Nu. The second is defined as ao = ω H / vswhere ω is the circular frequency of the fixed base structure, H is the height of superstructure and vs is the shear wave velocity. Rocking response of the (SDOF) system on nonlinear soil is examined through the general-purpose finite element software Abaqus to perform the parametric analysis, and to establish the failure mechanism of the system. Lightly loaded oscillators tend to uplift from the supporting soil whereas heavily loaded oscillators tend to accumulate settlement and soil yielding is intense. The structural response corresponding to moment-rotation settlement under monotonic loading at the mass center, under loading has been designed to output. The Python-based Abaqus scripting interface is used to realize a client-based model input, which is an extension of the Python object-oriented programming language.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of great oil reserves located under {{the northern part}} of the Caspian Sea has lead to an increased interest in the wave climate in this area. Statistical analysis of wave measurements is insufficient to determine reliable design wave conditions on {{the northern part of}} the Caspian Sea, because the amount of available wave measurements is insufficient and the available wave measurements do not contain events with design water levels. Wind and water level statistics, however, are available. Wave statistics can now be obtained by means of a wave generation model. At Delft University of Technology a wave generation model has been developed, named SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore). The model calculates the evolution of wind wave spectra. Test cases are needed in order to obtain an insight in the performance of this model. The northern part of the Caspian Sea could be an interesting test case. Water depths are small (3 to 4 meters at the Kashagan oil fields) and therefore many physical processes influence the wave spectra in this area. The commercial interest in the area has lead to the initiation of measurement campaigns, leading to the availability of wind and spectral wave measurements. This project therefore serves two main objectives. Firstly, Witteveen+Bos gains insight in the hydraulic boundary conditions on {{the northern part of the}} Caspian Sea. Secondly, SWAN in its current state of development is tested thoroughly on an interesting case. This can ultimately contribute to improvements of SWAN itself. Note that many hydraulic engineers follow the developments around SWAN with great interest, as it can be a valuable tool during various projects. This study is a succession of the MSc project by Van Thiel de Vries (2003). He calibrated SWAN on integral wave parameters, such as Hmo and Tp. The underlying burst pressure measurements of these wave parameters have now become available. In this project the model is re-calibrated with the use of spectral wave measurements. Furthermore its performance is studied quantitatively. The following approach was used: an inventory was made of the requirements and the availability of measurements; the burst pressure measurements were converted to wave spectra; the wave spectra were analysed qualitatively; typical events were selected for calibration; the SWAN model was setup and re-calibrated; the SWAN model's ability to determine the design wave spectrum was tested and quantified. An analysis of various methods for the conversion of burst pressure measurements to wave spectra showed some interesting results. Much controversy exists around the cut-off frequency of the so-called gain correction factor. This is the multiplying factor, applied to transform pressure variation spectra to sea level elevation spectra. This factor has its origin in linear wave theory. The factor must be cut-off at a certain value in order to prevent the introduction of instrument noise in the wave spectrum. The method, chosen at the end of the study, resulted in an increase in significant wave heights and a decrease in integral wave periods compared to those used by Van Thiel de Vries (2003) (although he used the same raw measurements). Contrary to his conclusions that a default configuration of SWAN overestimates wave heights and underestimates wave periods, SWAN had actually performed rather well. The mismatch proved to be due to an inaccuracy in the conversion of the raw data. The SWAN model created by Van Thiel de Vries (2003) was used as a basis. For this research the bathymetric map of this model was raised by 70 cm, after a comparison of the map with recent surveys and pressure measurements. The discrepancy was probably caused by an inconsistency in the definition of the reference levels in the old Russian bathymetric maps, on which it was based. The change in the map led to an improved auto-calibration of the Delft 3 D model, used for the calculation of winddriven <b>surges.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{management}} of domestic wastewater {{is a primary}} requirement for human well being. Failure to adequately address issues of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal can lead to adverse public health and environmental impacts. The increasing spread of urbanisation {{has led to the}} conversion of previously rural land into urban developments and the more intensive development of semi urban areas. However the provision of reticulated sewerage facilities has not kept pace with this expansion in urbanisation. This has resulted in a growing dependency on onsite sewage treatment. Though considered only as a temporary measure in the past, these systems are now considered as the most cost effective option and have become a permanent feature in some urban areas. This report is {{the first of a series}} of reports to be produced and is the outcome of a research project initiated by the Brisbane City Council. The primary objective of the research undertaken was to relate the treatment performance of onsite sewage treatment systems with soil conditions at site, with the emphasis being on septic tanks. This report consists of a ‘state of the art’ review of research undertaken in the arena of onsite sewage treatment. The evaluation of research brings together significant work undertaken locally and overseas. It focuses mainly on septic tanks in keeping with the primary objectives of the project. This report has acted as the springboard for the later field investigations and analysis undertaken as part of the project. Septic tanks still continue to be used widely due to their simplicity and low cost. Generally the treatment performance of septic tanks can be highly variable due to numerous factors, but a properly designed, operated and maintained septic tank can produce effluent of satisfactory quality. The reduction of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>surges</b> from washing machines and dishwashers, regular removal of accumulated septage and the elimination of harmful chemicals are some of the practices that can improve system performance considerably. The relative advantages of multi chamber over single chamber septic tanks is an issue that needs to be resolved in view of the conflicting research outcomes. In recent years, aerobic wastewater treatment systems (AWTS) have been gaining in popularity. This can be mainly attributed to the desire to avoid subsurface effluent disposal, which is the main cause of septic tank failure. The use of aerobic processes for treatment of wastewater and the disinfection of effluent prior to disposal is capable of producing effluent of a quality suitable for surface disposal. However the field performance of these has been disappointing. A significant number of these systems do not perform to stipulated standards and quality can be highly variable. This is primarily due to houseowner neglect or ignorance of correct operational and maintenance procedures. The other problems include greater susceptibility to shock loadings and sludge bulking. As identified in literature a number of design features can also contribute to this wide variation in quality. The other treatment processes in common use are the various types of filter systems. These include intermittent and recirculating sand filters. These systems too have their inherent advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore as in the case of aerobic systems, their performance is very much dependent on individual houseowner operation and maintenance practices. In recent years the use of biofilters has attracted research interest and particularly the use of peat. High removal rates of various wastewater pollutants have been reported in research literature. Despite these satisfactory results, leachate from peat has been reported in various studies. This is an issue that needs further investigations and as such biofilters can still be considered to be in the experimental stage. The use of other filter media such as absorbent plastic and bark has also been reported in literature. The safe and hygienic disposal of treated effluent is a matter of concern in the case of onsite sewage treatment. Subsurface disposal is the most common and the only option in the case of septic tank treatment. Soil is an excellent treatment medium if suitable conditions are present. The processes of sorption, filtration and oxidation can remove the various wastewater pollutants. The subsurface characteristics of the disposal area are among the most important parameters governing process performance. Therefore it is important that the soil and topographic conditions are taken into consideration in the design of the soil absorption system. Seepage trenches and beds are the common systems in use. Seepage pits or chambers can be used where subsurface conditions warrant, whilst above grade mounds have been recommended for a variety of difficult site conditions. All these systems have their inherent advantages and disadvantages and the preferable soil absorption system should be selected based on site characteristics. The use of gravel as in-fill for beds and trenches is open to question. It does not contribute to effluent treatment and has been shown to reduce the effective infiltrative surface area. This is due to physical obstruction and the migration of fines entrained in the gravel, into the soil matrix. The surface application of effluent is coming into increasing use with the advent of aerobic treatment systems. This has the advantage that treatment is undertaken on the upper soil horizons, which is chemically and biologically the most effective in effluent renovation. Numerous research studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this practice. However the overriding criteria is the quality of the effluent. It has to be of exceptionally good quality in order to ensure that there are no resulting public health impacts due to aerosol drift. This essentially is the main issue of concern, due to the unreliability of the effluent quality from aerobic systems. Secondly, it has also been found that most householders do not take adequate care in the operation of spray irrigation systems or in the maintenance of the irrigation area. Under these circumstances surface disposal of effluent should be approached with caution and would require appropriate householder education and stringent compliance requirements. However despite all this, the efficiency with which the process is undertaken will ultimately rest with the individual householder and this is where most concern rests. Greywater too should require similar considerations. Surface irrigation of greywater is currently being permitted in a number of local authority jurisdictions in Queensland. Considering the fact that greywater constitutes the largest fraction of the total wastewater generated in a household, it could be considered to be a potential resource. Unfortunately in most circumstances the only pretreatment that is required to be undertaken prior to reuse is the removal of oil and grease. This is an issue of concern as greywater can considered to be a weak to medium sewage as it contains primary pollutants such as BOD material and nutrients and may also include microbial contamination. Therefore its use for surface irrigation can pose a potential health risk. This is further compounded by the fact that most householders are unaware of the potential adverse impacts of indiscriminate greywater reuse. As in the case of blackwater effluent reuse, there have been suggestions that greywater should also be subjected to stringent guidelines. Under these circumstances the surface application of any wastewater requires careful consideration. The other option available for the disposal effluent is the use of evaporation systems. The use of evapotranspiration systems has been covered in this report. Research has shown that these systems are susceptible to a number of factors and in particular to climatic conditions. As such their applicability is location specific. Also the design of systems based solely on evapotranspiration is questionable. In order to ensure more reliability, the systems should be designed to include soil absorption. The successful use of these systems for intermittent usage has been noted in literature. Taking into consideration the issues discussed above, subsurface disposal of effluent is the safest under most conditions. This is provided the facility has been designed to accommodate site conditions. The main problem associated with subsurface disposal is the formation of a clogging mat on the infiltrative surfaces. Due to the formation of the clogging mat, the capacity of the soil to handle effluent is no longer governed by the soil’s hydraulic conductivity as measured by the percolation test, but rather by the infiltration rate through the clogged zone. The characteristics of the clogging mat have been shown to be influenced by various soil and effluent characteristics. Secondly, the mechanisms of clogging mat formation have been found to be influenced by various physical, chemical and biological processes. Biological clogging is the most common process taking place and occurs due to bacterial growth or its by-products reducing the soil pore diameters. Biological clogging is generally associated with anaerobic conditions. The formation of the clogging mat provides significant benefits. It acts as an efficient filter for the removal of microorganisms. Also as the clogging mat increases the hydraulic impedance to flow, unsaturated flow conditions will occur below the mat. This permits greater contact between effluent and soil particles thereby enhancing the purification process. This is particularly important in the case of highly permeable soils. However the adverse impacts of the clogging mat formation cannot be ignored as they can lead to significant reduction in the infiltration rate. This in fact is the most common cause of soil absorption systems failure. As the formation of the clogging mat is inevitable, it is important|$|R
