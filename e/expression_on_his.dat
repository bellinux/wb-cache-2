The figure {{is that of}} a lone Confederate soldier, who stands facing south with his arms crossed. His wide-brimmed hat is clasped in his right hand and he is looking down toward the ground with a somber <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. The soldier is facing south, {{the general direction of the}} battlefields of the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Sent in 1968 {{to head a}} state-run {{agricultural}} {{factory in}} Buftea, Drăghici retired in 1972. He was given a lavish pension as an older-generation party member and continued to reside in a luxurious Dorobanți villa. In the 1980s, he was sometimes seen standing in line to buy groceries, a rigid <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, his eyes averted. Late in that decade, he was reportedly pleased by the increasing isolation and seeming self-destruction of Ceaușescu's regime.|$|E
500|$|The press {{coverage}} of the trial included the publication on day two, by The Sun, of a notorious close-up of a half-smiling Silcott, one that [...] "created a monster to stalk the nightmares of Middle England," [...] as journalist Kurt Barling put it. Silcott {{said he had been}} asleep in a police cell when it was taken; he said he was woken up, held in a corridor with his arms pinned against a wall and photographed, and that the <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face was one of fear. Its publication constituted [...] "the most gross contempt," [...] according to the trial judge, Sir Derek Hodgson (1917–2002), speaking to David Rose in 1992. No action was taken against the newspaper.|$|E

He is fired for coming late, driving customers away and for fooling around in office. Shortly a sound is heard and Cooper faints with pained <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared {{for when he}} was wounded in 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E

In the 1994 picture, a smiling Jágr {{is on the phone}} with an unspecified general manager. In the 2017 picture, he is seen looking at his mobile phone with a puzzled <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. The Panthers organization announced shortly after {{that they would not be}} seeking to re-sign Jágr.|$|E
2500|$|Watteau lacked aristocratic patrons; his buyers were bourgeois such as {{bankers and}} dealers. Among {{his most famous}} paintings, beside the two {{versions}} of the Pilgrimage to Cythera (one in the Louvre, the other in the Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin), are Pierrot (long identified as [...] "Gilles"), Fêtes venitiennes, Love in the Italian Theater, Love in the French Theater, [...] "Voulez-vous triompher des belles?" [...] and Mezzetin. The subject of his hallmark painting, Pierrot (Gilles), is an actor in a white satin costume who stands isolated from his four companions, staring ahead with an enigmatic <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Kateegoose, having been called, came forward. He was an ill-favoured savage, with various <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> ugly visage {{which were not}} so much Nature's gifts {{as the result of}} his own evil passions. Jealousy was one of them, and he had often turned a green eye on Okematan. There were {{indications}} about his mouth and fingers, as he came forward, that justified the commentaries <b>on</b> <b>his</b> habits, and betrayed recent acquaintance with fat pork.|$|R

After seeing the shocked <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> friends's faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon.|$|R
2500|$|Totò, Peppino De Filippo, and Aroldo Tieri. In 1965, Petito played The Usher in segment [...] "4 'Cittadini, stato e chiesa', episode 1" [...] of Made in Italy {{and then}} starred in Io, io, io... e gli altri in 1966 which {{featured}} Gina Lollobrigida, Walter Chiari, Nino Manfredi and Marcello Mastroianni, amongst others. His final role in cinema was as the feeble, helpless storekeeper in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly who is abused by the bandit Tuco Benedicto (Eli Wallach) and robbed. Petito utters lines such as [...] "Colt, Remington, Smith & Wesson" [...] and [...] "It's all I have" [...] with a gormless <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face and Tuco memorably places the store's closed sign in Petito's mouth as he departs {{as a gesture}} to keep quiet.|$|E
2500|$|In Ophelia's next appearance, {{she tells}} Polonius that Hamlet rushed {{into her room}} with his {{clothing}} askew and a [...] "hellish" [...] <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face; he only stared at her, nodding three times without speaking to her. Based on what Ophelia told him, Polonius concludes that he was wrong to forbid Ophelia from seeing Hamlet, and that Hamlet must be mad with love for her. Polonius immediately decides to go to Claudius, the new King of Denmark and also Hamlet's uncle and stepfather, about the situation. Polonius later suggests to Claudius that they hide behind an [...] to overhear Hamlet speaking to Ophelia, when Hamlet thinks the conversation is private. Since Polonius is now sure that Hamlet is lovesick for Ophelia, he thinks Hamlet will express his love for her. Claudius agrees to try the eavesdropping plan later.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} able-bodied men were gone, people still {{resisted}} being {{forced out of}} their dwellings and tried to desert from the columns as they moved through {{the eastern part of}} the ghetto. [...] The Nazis murdered 600 to 1,000 people in the process of forcing out the people. Eventually columns of about 1,000 people were formed and marched out. [...] The first column was led by the lawyer, Dr. Eljaschow. [...] "The <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face showed no disquiet whatsoever; on the contrary, because everyone was looking at him, he made an effort to smile hopefully." [...] Next to Dr. Eljaschow was Rabbi Zack. [...] Other well-known citizens of Riga were in the columns. Among the guards were Altmeyer, Jäger, and Herberts Cukurs. [...] Cukurs, a world-famous pilot, was the most recognizable Latvian SD man at the scene, whom Kaufmann described as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|In an easy-chair {{opposite}} to me my listener sat and listened {{for two hours}} every evening. I interested myself by watching and attempting to analyze the <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, but what these appeared to indicate made no difference in my remarks. I do not think he liked repetitions, but if I chose to tell a thing several times, I did so. He {{had no right to}} tell me that he had heard that before. Immunity from this remark was to me a rare enjoyment.|$|R

60|$|Sydney and Brendon vied {{with one}} another in their efforts to engage Anna in conversation, and Miss Ellicot, during the {{momentary}} lull, deemed it a favourable opportunity to recommence siege operations. The young man was mollified by her sympathy, and flattered by the obvious attempts of several of the other guests to draw him into conversation. Yet every now and then, during the progress of the meal, his attention apparently wandered, and leaning forward he glanced covertly at Anna with a curious mixture of <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.|$|R
2500|$|The {{video for}} the song was filmed near Slough, Berkshire, during November 1981 and has {{the theme of the}} filming and editing of a murder-mystery film, {{featuring}} the band members as characters and production staff. [...] Due to it being a [...] "making of" [...] video, both crew and camera apparatus appear throughout. It was conceived and directed by filmmaker Steve Barron, and has at its core the interaction between a successful actress (also a 2nd negative cutter) played by Susan Ann Sulley walking out on [...] "film director" [...] Philip Oakey on a film set. [...] It is loosely based on the film A Star Is Born. Near the end of the video, Wright, who also plays a film editor, has an <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, while the camera pulls back to reveal that the negative room where Oakey, Wright, and Sulley were working in is yet another set (the camera {{can be seen in the}} mirror's reflection).|$|E
2500|$|... : Akira is the {{character}} {{for whom the}} story is named. He has immense, almost godlike psychic powers, although from outward appearances {{he looks like a}} small, normal child. He is responsible for the destruction of Tokyo and the beginning of World War III. After the war, he was placed in cryogenics not far from the crater created by him, and the future site of the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Games. Shortly after being awoken by Tetsuo, he causes the destruction of Neo-Tokyo during a confrontation between Kaneda and the Colonel's forces. Later in the story he becomes Emperor of the Great Tokyo Empire. When he first appears, Akira has not aged in the decades he was kept frozen. Akira is essentially an empty shell; his powers have overwritten and destroyed his personality, leaving someone who almost never speaks or reacts to external stimuli, with a constant blank <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. In the end he is shot by Ryu while psychically synced with the increasingly unstable Tetsuo. It is at this moment he is reunited with his friends and regains his personality.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan and his {{subjects}} were celebrating their conquest of Jing Province, with Lü Meng receiving the highest honour. During the banquet, Guan Yu's spirit suddenly possessed Lü Meng, grabbed Sun Quan and shouted, [...] "Green-eyed brat! Purple-bearded coward, {{do you still}} recognise me?" [...] Sun Quan's subordinates were shocked and immediately rushed forth to save their lord. The possessed Lü Meng shoved Sun Quan away and sat on his seat. With a furious <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, he boomed, [...] "Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I've fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can't feast on your flesh while I was still alive, but I can still seize Lü Meng's soul after death! I'm Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village." [...] Sun Quan {{and the others were}} so terrified that they sank to their knees. Lü Meng collapsed and died, bleeding from seven body orifices. Everyone was traumatised by the scene they witnessed.|$|E
60|$|His {{face had}} become frozen, as it were, {{in a very}} curious look at Darnay: an intent look, {{deepening}} into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> him <b>his</b> thoughts had wandered away.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some time}} Denham broke seals, read contents, and made jottings, without any <b>expression</b> {{whatever}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> countenance. Presently {{he took up}} an ill-folded epistle addressed to [...] "Mister Denham" [...] in a round and rather rugged hand.|$|R

2500|$|Griffith—indignant at the film's {{negative}} critical reception—wrote {{letters to}} newspapers and published a pamphlet {{in which he}} accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. [...] Griffith's 1916 pamphlet The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America used racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted [...] "censorship" [...] as a monstrous black man with a lascivious <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face eyeing [...] "free speech" [...] who appeared as a white woman {{dressed in a white}} dress. [...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted as a black man). When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was [...] "damaging my reputation as a producer" [...] and [...] "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, Intolerance (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.|$|E
2500|$|Martin took tenth {{place on}} the first stage, ending at the Mont des Alouettes, staying with the first large group on the road but unable to match the {{accelerations}} of the day's winner Philippe Gilbert. Coming off their win in the team time trial at the Giro d'Italia, and with several of the same riders plus very strong time trialist Martin present, the squad {{was considered one of}} the favorites for the Tour's team test. However, they were unable to duplicate their success from earlier in the season, finishing five seconds slower than their American rivals [...] for fifth {{place on the}} day. Stage 3 was also a day that [...] got the better of them. All appeared to be going well at first, as the team hit the front with strength and numbers once the morning's breakaway was caught. However, they made errors negotiating a sharp left-hand turn at [...] to go, and [...] was able to take first position again. Displaced by his leadout men's errors, Cavendish could only manage fifth in the sprint, behind 's Tyler Farrar. Cavendish rebounded in stage 5, another straightforward sprint stage. While late attacks from Edvald Boasson Hagen and Philippe Gilbert threatened to disrupt the sprint once again, the peloton chased them down, and Cavendish timed his sprint perfectly to take his first win of this Tour. Stage 6 had an undulating, hilly profile, such that the finish was unlikely to suit Cavendish. The team worked for Goss, and the Australian narrowly missed the day's honors, taking second in the final sprint behind Boasson Hagen. The flat seventh stage was perhaps the first of the Tour that went completely to popular expectations, as the HTC-Highroad team provided the strength necessary to bring back the morning breakaway and was ubiquitous in the final few kilometers, dominantly leading Cavendish out to his second win of this Tour. This stage ended at Châteauroux, site of Cavendish's first win in the 2008 Tour de France. The sprint ace was evidently quite aware of this, as he mimicked his victory reaction from three years prior, grabbing his helmt with both hands and painting a shocked <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. Due to a crash involving most of , Martin and Velits entered the top ten overall with this day's results, occupying eighth and ninth place respectively at day's end. Van Garderen's presence in a stage 8 breakaway resulted in him taking the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification. He was the first American to wear the polka dot jersey during a Tour stage in its history.|$|E

60|$|I don’t {{know how}} he meant it, but at that moment, slim and elegant, he seemed a mere bundle of nerves himself, with the flitting <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> thin, well-bred face, with the restlessness of his meagre brown hands amongst the objects on the table. With some pipe ash amongst a little spilt wine his {{forefinger}} traced a capital R. Then he looked into an empty glass profoundly. I have a notion that I sat there staring and listening like a yokel at a play. Mills’ pipe was lying quite a foot away in front of him, empty, cold. Perhaps he had no more tobacco. Mr. Blunt assumed his dandified air—nervously.|$|R
