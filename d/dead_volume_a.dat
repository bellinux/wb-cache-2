40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Research in the {{miniaturization}} of thermomechanical {{systems in}} recent years has proven to be both rewarding and challenging. Micro-scale devices have tremendous technological potential but come with a new set of design problems. One such problem is energy storage. Heat actuated systems, driven primarily by thermal energy, take advantage of the high stored energy density of hydrocarbon fuels, and are therefore desirable for small-scale applications. One concept for a heat-actuated compressor is called a thermocompressor, which is a variation of a traditional Stirling engine. Thermocompressors use constant volume heat addition to pressurize their working fluid without applying any mechanical work to the gas. Such devices would be well suited for numerous applications such as power cycles, heat pumps, refrigeration, and liquid pumps. This thesis develops a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the thermocompressor cycle providing insight into the operation of the cycle and the sensitivity of the cycle's performance to various design parameters including regenerator effectiveness, regenerator <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> hot side <b>dead</b> <b>volume,</b> and cold side <b>dead</b> <b>volume.</b> The developed model shows that the thermal efficiency is highly sensitive to regenerator effectiveness, which motivates a regenerator optimization study.

The silicon valve part, 7 × 7 × 1 mm 3 in dimensions, is a sandwich construction of two KOH etched silicon wafers {{with a layer of}} chemical resistant silicone rubber bonded in between. This middle layer provides the flexibility needed to move the valve boss positioned in the top wafer during valve operation, but also results in improved sealing if the valve is closed. In order to drive the valve, a dedicated bi-stable electromagnetic actuator has been designed by applying a finite element software package. The resulting actuator consists of a spring-biased armature that can move 0. 2 mm up and down in a magnetically soft iron housing, incorporating a permanent magnet and a coil. This large stroke makes the valve particle tolerant. A major advantage of the bi-stable design is that only electrical energy is needed to switch the valve between the open and closed state. The actuator has been manufactured by conventional machining and was attached to the individual silicon valve parts resulting in a valve with a footprint of 7 × 7 mm 2 and a height of 21 mm.
