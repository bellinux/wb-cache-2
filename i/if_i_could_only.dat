[...] This was said to William Kinsey Hutchinson, then International News Service's Washington Bureau Chief. Hutchinson {{indicated}} that Borah confided this [...] "in words that ran like a prayer." [...] McKenna noted, [...] "It was fortuitous that the march of events prevented Borah from joining those pacifists and liberals... who trudged up the hill to Berchtesgaden to lay before the Fuehrer their plans for world peace".|$|E
500|$|On March 28, Hinckley {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C. by bus and {{checked into the}} Park Central Hotel. He noticed Reagan's {{schedule}} that was published in The Washington Star and {{decided it was time}} to act. Hinckley knew that he might be killed during the assassination attempt, and he wrote but did not mail a letter to Foster about two hours prior to his attempt on the President's life. In the letter, he said that he hoped to impress her with the magnitude of his action and that he would [...] "abandon the idea of getting Reagan in a second <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> win your heart and live out the rest of my life with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The reunion album, titled simply Byrds, was {{released}} on March 7, 1973 to mixed reviews. [...] As a result, a planned tour {{in support of the}} album failed to materialize. [...] Among the album's shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound. [...] Nonetheless, the album managed to climb to number 20 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK. [...] In the United States, the album became the band's highest charting LP of new material since 1965's Turn! Turn! Turn!, which had also been the last Byrds' album to feature Gene Clark as a full member. [...] Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn's folk-flavored [...] "Sweet Mary", the Joni Mitchell cover [...] "For Free", a re-recording of Crosby's song [...] "Laughing" [...] (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Remember My Name), and a pair of Neil Young songs. [...] The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions [...] "Changing Heart" [...] and [...] "Full Circle", the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its working title and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Haggard made a {{comeback}} of sorts, signing with the independent record label Anti and releasing the spare <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Fly to critical acclaim. He followed it in 2001 with Roots, vol. 1, {{a collection of}} Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, and Hank Thompson covers, along with three Haggard originals. The album, recorded in Haggard's living room with no overdubs, featured Haggard's longtime bandmates, the Strangers, as well as Frizzell's original lead guitarist, Norman Stephens. In December 2004, Haggard spoke at length on Larry King Live about his incarceration {{as a young man}} and said it was [...] "hell" [...] and [...] "the scariest experience of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iron Maiden's 1983 album Piece of Mind {{features}} a short backwards message, included by the band {{in response to}} allegations of Satanism that were surrounding them at the time. Between the songs [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Still Life" [...] is inebriated drummer Nicko McBrain doing an impression of Idi Amin Dada: [...] "'What ho', sed de t'ing wid de t'ree bonce [...] Don't meddle wid t'ings you don't understand," [...] followed by a belch. Prince's controversial song [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] includes the backmasked message, [...] "Hello, how are you? I am fine, because I know that the Lord is coming soon." [...] The Waitresses' 1982 EP I Could Rule the World <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Get the Parts included a backwards masking warning on the cover and a message masked within the song [...] "The Smartest Person I Know": [...] "Anyone who believes in backwards masking is a fool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crosby contributed {{the song}} [...] "Long Live the King", a cynical {{commentary}} on the star-making mechanics of the music business, which was ironic, since it was precisely those same materialistic business practices that had enabled The Byrds' reunion to transpire in the first place. [...] Crosby also chose to revisit the song [...] "Laughing", which had already been released on his first solo album, <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> Remember My Name, in 1971. [...] Crosby's rationale for re-recording the song {{was that he had}} originally written [...] "Laughing" [...] in 1967, during his last days as a member of The Byrds and as such, it had initially been intended for inclusion on a Byrds' album. [...] The version of [...] "Laughing" [...] featured on Byrds saw the return of McGuinn's raga rock style of guitar playing, which had last been utilized on the band's Fifth Dimension and Younger Than Yesterday albums. [...] Crosby also sang the lead vocal on the album's Joni Mitchell cover, [...] "For Free".|$|E
