5|$|The {{argument}} from morality <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> {{for the existence}} of God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> that {{copyright}} {{is invalid}} because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce {{and is a}} legal fiction created by the state.

25|$|The long {{tailpipe}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> {{stating that}} usage of electric vehicles does {{not result in}} fewer emissions (e.g. greenhouse gases) compared to those from non-electric vehicles. While the argument acknowledges that plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode have no greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, it claims that these emissions are shifted from the vehicle tailpipe {{to the location of}} the electrical generation plants. From {{the point of view of}} a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the actual carbon footprint depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{arguments}} for a different author <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> in favor of attributing this work to the bishop Fulgentius. This theory {{is based on the}} fact that the manuscripts of the Ages of the World attribute the work to “Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius” (Claudius and Gordianus both being names known to belong to members of the bishop’s immediate family). However, the inclusion of these names in manuscripts was most likely the mistake of some eight or ninth century scribe who assumed ‘Fulgentius’ to be the well-known theologian. It is also possible that Fabius Fulgentius had multiple names (very popular for aristocrats of the time) which included Claudius and Gordianus.|$|E

25|$|A {{hyperbolic}} angle <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> of a hyperbolic function just as {{the circular}} angle is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite.|$|E
25|$|Specified {{complexity}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> {{proposed by}} Dembski {{and used by}} him in his works promoting intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept is intended to formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both specified and complex. Dembski states that specified complexity is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, a central tenet to intelligent design and which Dembski argues for in opposition to modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity {{is widely regarded as}} mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology. Specified complexity is one of the two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being irreducible complexity.|$|E
25|$|However, as Australia's CAD {{is almost}} entirely {{generated}} by the private sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford's 'Consenting Adults Thesis' in the early 1990s, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> that the CAD is not a significant issue. Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital {{to fill the gap}} between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|Asset {{specificity}} {{is usually}} considered to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> for vertical integration.

In this paper I show that asset specificity can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> for non-integration. In a repeated-game model of self-enforcing relational contracts, it is shown that when parties are non-integrated, increasing degrees of asset specificity {{make it possible to}} design relational contracts with higher-powered incentives.

25|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support. Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with female employment also limit the effectiveness of legalisation. These include the lack of independent trade unions, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to {{occupational health and safety}} issues.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, of all {{the current}} {{newspapers}} published within Cornwall, only one is independent, the St. Ives Times & Echo, which formed out of the merger of Western Echo and the St. Ives Times in 1972. All of the others are either owned by Tindle Newspaper Group, Newsquest or Northcliffe Newspapers Group. The geographical coverage of the existing papers is also haphazard, {{with a lot of}} duplication (for example, Callington is covered by the East Cornwall Times, The Cornish Times and the Cornish & Devon Post) while some areas (particularly North Cornwall/Bude) are poorly served (just the North Cornwall edition of the St Austell centric Cornish Guardian). There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> that Cornwall would be better served having at least one weekly paper which covers the entire county, as {{one of the main reasons}} for purchasing the weekly paper is by prospective property buyers and people buying and selling cars and job seekers. Indeed, The West Briton has gone some way to accommodate this; although there are four separate news editions of the paper, each week a classified/job vacancy section and a property section cover all of mid and west Cornwall, though places east of Bodmin, for no known reason, are generally excluded.|$|E

Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> that historians used to assert that Greek resistance {{was a turning point}} in World War II. According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler Leni Riefenstahl, Hitler said that [...] "if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no Stalingrad". Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.|$|E
