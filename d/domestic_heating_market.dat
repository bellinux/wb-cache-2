40|$|Simulation {{of energy}} systems and {{associated}} thermodynamic domains is very powerful in delivering precise information at high resolution. Modelling software requires {{detailed information about}} the energy system. The specialised user usually has questions about specific aspects of the energy system {{and may not be}} interested in the complete set of outputs available from simulation results. Similarly the specialised user may only be concerned about a subset of the inputs provided to the software. This suggests an opportunity to develop an input / output scheme tailored for the specialised user. The power of simulation can be accessed through the use of simplified interfaces. Although these restrict flexibility in terms of model input / output data the specialised user is only interested in a subset of the capability of the underlying simulation tool. Robust results rely on a consistent underlying simulation context, this restricted interface ensures that only the parameters of interest to the users are modifiable and that other simulation parameters remain fixed ensuring a consistent and repeatable output. One such example of limited user interaction for both output and input is the ADEPT interface to whole building and plant dynamic modelling and simulation suite ESPr (ESRU 2002). The interface was developed {{in the context of the}} UK <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> <b>market.</b> This paper describes the development of the ADEPT tool and associated spreadsheet templates in order to provide a readily usable platform for the study of domestic heating systems and controls for plant and control components manufacturers, regulatory authorities and research organisations...|$|E

50|$|During the 1970s Britain {{suffered}} a major energy crisis and many {{politicians in the}} UK and US were astutely looking at alternative ways to transport freight in ways that could reduce dependency on oil. The decline of the British Empire {{and the opening of}} Tilbury docks caused the closure of the upriver docks on the river Thames and started a steep decline in traditional London lighterage which had transported large amounts of coal. Between 1967 and 1976 over 40 lighterage firms closed down. At the same time the UKs <b>domestic</b> central <b>heating</b> <b>market</b> emerged oil quickly replacing coal. The race thus reflected a more pragmatic political ethos and was a way of keeping alive a dying industry and its river skills as the energy crisis deepened further.|$|R

A third of patients (29. 5 %) said they had difficulty keeping warm prior to this admission. The majority of patients said they could not manage to keep warm in the winter without financial hardship.

40|$|Abstract: There is an {{increasing}} interest in developing sustainable systems in the European Union (EU) to recover and upgrade the solid wastes of the olive oil extraction process, i. e. wet husk. A Life Cycle Environmental Impact Assessment (LCIA) of wet husk {{has been carried out}} aiming at facilitating an appropriate Life Cycle Management of this biomass. Three scenarios have been considered, i. e. combustion for <b>domestic</b> <b>heat,</b> generation of electric power, and composting. The Environmental Product Declaration and the ReCiPe method were used for Life Cycle Impact Assessment. <b>Domestic</b> <b>heating</b> and power generation were the most important impact factors in damaging human health, ecosystems, and natural resources depletion. Composting was 2 - 4 orders of magnitude less impacting than <b>domestic</b> <b>heat</b> and power generation. Considering human health, the impact of climate change, human toxicity and particulate matter formation represented the main impact categories. Considering ecosystems, climate change and natural land transformation were the main impact categories. Within natural resources, fossil fuel depletion was impacted three orders more than metal depletion. Within <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> and power generation scenarios, storage of wet husk along with the extraction by organic solvent, and the waste treatment were the most impacting phases for global warming potential, ozone layer depletion, acidification and non renewable fossil resources depletion. The results obtained for the waste disposal have been comparatively assessed with respect to the environmental impact of the olive oil production chain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{a portfolio of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>heat</b> pumps controlled by an aggregator. The aggregator is able to adjust the consumption of the heat pumps without affecting the comfort in the houses and uses this ability to shift the main consumption to hours with low electricity prices.

A simulation is carried out {{based on data from}} a Danish <b>domestic</b> <b>heat</b> pump project, historical spot prices, regulating power prices, and spot price predictions.

40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>heating</b> using {{combustion}} {{of biomass}} is strongly {{involved in the}} development of renewable energy. However, it can be associated to high emission of particulate matter characterized with a very fin size distribution and strong contribution of organic condensables. In France, the residential sector, to which heating using biomass combustion is a major contributor represents {{the main part of the}} national emissions inventory of PM and PAHs. In order to address the issue, the French environmental agency (ADEME) is promoting the development of highly energetically and environmentally heating devices. To that extent, the Peren 2 BOIS program which was financially supported by the ADEME and the French ministry of environment and was coordinated by INERIS and gathered, industrials, notified bodies, private and public research laboratories. It mainly aimed at evaluating the efficiency of primary and secondary reduction techniques for particles and organic compounds emissions. Four techniques used for the reduction of particulate and gaseous atmospheric pollutants emitted by <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> systems using biomass were tested during the project: two electrostatic dust filters, one cyclone and one catalytic filter. A wide range of pollutants were taken into account :total suspended particles (TSP); fine particles mass and number concentrations; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); benzene and its isomers (BTEX); gases such as CO, total VOCs, etc. Each technique was tested in combination with a different <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> system using biomass, the <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> system were three woodlog stoves and one pellet stove. The efficiency was tested by comparing the amount of pollutants measured in the flue gas during five successive combustion batches : before and after the technique (electrostatic dust filters and cyclone); or with and without the technique (catalytic filter).
