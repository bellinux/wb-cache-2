40|$|The {{effects of}} a commercially {{available}} equine hyperimmune anti-endotoxin serum on synovial fluid parameters were evaluated in an induced synovitis model in normal horses. Four groups of 3 horses each received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus hyperimmune antiendotoxin (anti-LPS), LPS, anti-LPS, and Ringers lactate (control) respectively injected into the left <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint.</b> Synovial fluid parameters were measured at 4, 8, 24 and 72 h. It was found that anti-LPS had no attenuating effect on the LPS and that it induced a synovitis almost equivalent to that induced by LPS alone. The introduction of sterile Ringers lactate solution into the carpal joint together with repeated aseptic arthrocentesis induces a mild inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{determined}} {{the ability of}} an oral nutraceutical supplement to attenuate the oxidative stress and inflammation that occurs in muscles and joints with repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise in horses. The supplement, fed daily, was comprised of whole dried mushrooms, golden flaxseed, omega- 3 fatty acids, plant-based enzymes, a melon-concentrate powder, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii. Ten horses participated in a partial cross-over design, with 7 horses completing the Control trial and 7 horses completing the supplement trial. Blood and synovial fluid samples (from the <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint)</b> were taken before, and at 1 and 24  hours after a standardized, repeated high-intensity exercise test that was performed before supplementation and on the 22 nd day of supplementation. At {{the end of the}} supplement trial exercise resulted in reduced concentrations of plasma markers of oxidative stress (decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, with increased total antioxidant status and increased superoxide dismutase activity); there was no effect on plasma markers of muscle injury (creatine, creatine kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase) or inflammation (PGE 2, nitric oxide). Within synovial fluid, there was a tendency for increased superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased concentration of glycosaminoglycans. It is concluded that the supplement, when fed to horses as part of the normal diet for 23  days, was associated with reduced concentrations of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in muscle and synovial fluid...|$|E
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the mechanical function of a joint. Understanding the unique abilities and mechanical properties of articular cartilage is important in preventing, diagnosing, and treating damage. It is believed that variation of cartilage thickness strongly influences the overall function of the joint. Therefore, this study explores how articular cartilage thickness correlates with types of equine joints and the articular surfaces within the joints. The average thickness of three different equine joints which undergo a variety of loads and ranges of motion was determined via a Bruker CETR machine. Seven articular surfaces were tested: (1) medial and (2) lateral condyles of the distal third metacarpus in the fetlock joint; (3) medial aspects of the distal radius and (4) proximal radial carpal bone of the radiocarpal joint; (5) distal radial carpal bone and (6) proximal third carpal bone of the midcarpal joint; and (7) medial femoral condyle of the stifle joint. Results indicate that the mean articular cartilage thickness of the stifle joint was significantly greater than both the carpus and fetlock joints in all six horses analyzed (p < 0. 05). There was a difference (p = 0. 35) in the cartilage thickness of the carpus compared to the fetlock joint. Within the carpus, the radiocarpal joint cartilage thickness was found to be significantly greater than that of the <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint</b> (p < 0. 05). However, in the fetlock joint {{there was no significant difference}} between the thickness of articular cartilage of the medial and lateral condyles of the distal cannon bone...|$|E

40|$|Repeated arthrocentesis is {{necessary}} to diagnose and monitor the evolution of joint diseases, but the procedure may worsen any inflammation and lead to an alteration in synovial fluid. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of repeated arthrocentesis on synovial fluid cytology in healthy horses with normal joints. The experimental study was approved by Ethics Committee (University of Pisa, Italy). Four horses were enrolled in this study on the basis of inclusion criteria and underwent repeated arthrocentesis of the <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint</b> of both left and right forelimbs. The synovial fluid samples were processed for total protein concentration, total nucleated cell count, and differential leukocyte count. Data distribution was performed with the Komolgorovâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Smirnov test, and a Friedman test for repeated measures and Dunn's test as post hoc were performed in order to verify differences related to sampling times comparing each time point. Significance was set at P <. 05. All horses remained free of lameness throughout the study period. Statistical differences were found for macrophage and lymphocyte related to sampling time. Our results support the finding that repeated arthrocentesis does not induce detectable synovial fluid alterations. Although mild statistically significant changes in macrophage and lymphocyte populations were found, the values were always within normal ranges, suggesting that these changes were not clinically significant. Moreover, the cytologic alterations rapidly solved. In conclusion, repeated arthrocentesis does not cause long term and clinically relevant alterations in synovial fluid cytology in healthy horses with normal joints...|$|E
40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Serum amyloid A (SAA) in {{synovial}} fluid {{has recently been}} used as a marker for septic arthritis in horses but the effects of repeated intra-articular (IA) administration of amikacin on synovial SAA concentrations are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To report the effect of repeated IA administration of amikacin on SAA, total protein (TP), nucleated cell count (NCC) and differential NCC in {{synovial fluid}} of healthy equine joints. METHODS: A controlled, 2 period crossover study was performed on 5 clinically healthy horses. Each <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint</b> received one of 2 treatments every 48 h for 5 consecutive times: arthrocentesis alone (control group) or arthrocentesis combined with IA administration of 500 mg of amikacin (treatment group). Clinical and lameness examinations were performed daily. Serum SAA and synovial SAA, TP, NCC and differential NCC were measured and statistically compared. Significance level was set at P < 0. 05. RESULTS: Horses remained healthy and nonlame throughout the study. Baseline values for all variables were not significantly different between groups. Values for TP in the treatment group were significantly higher than in the control group after the first sample (P < 0. 05). In both groups NCC increased significantly (P < 0. 05) after the first sample. No significant changes were identified in differential NCC. In both groups, all synovial and most serum SAA concentrations remained below the lower limit of quantification. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated IA administration of amikacin caused increased values of TP and NCC in synovial fluid, with some TP concentrations falling within the range reported for septic arthritis. In contrast, synovial SAA concentrations did not increase in either group. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Synovial SAA could serve as a more reliable marker than TP and NCC when evaluating a joint previously sampled or treated with amikacin.

40|$|Background: Nutraceuticals {{are often}} used in the {{management}} of equine osteoarthritis, but scientific evidence of their efficacy is lacking. Objectives: To study the preventive effects of two new nutraceuticals after the experimental induction of synovitis in comparison with positive and negative control treatments. Study design: Blinded, controlled, randomised experiment. Methods: Twenty-four healthy Standardbred horses were randomly allocated to supplement AT (multi-ingredient, 28 days), supplement HP (collagen hydrolysate, 60 days), meloxicam (4 days) or placebo (60 days). Synovitis was induced in the right <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joint</b> by intra-articular injection of 0. 5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli while treatments were continued. Blood and synovial fluid were sampled before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Synovial fluid samples were analysed for total nucleated cell count (TNCC), total protein (TP) and selected biomarkers (prostaglandin E 2 [PGE 2], interleukin- 6 [IL- 6], glycosaminoglycans [GAGs], type II collagen synthesis [CPII], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]). Lameness was scored by visual examination and pressure plate analysis immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Clinical examinations were performed before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, at 2, 4 and 6 h post-injection, and then twice per day during the test period. Results: Before treatment and intra-articular challenge, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups for any of the parameters. After intra-articular challenge, the placebo group showed significantly higher synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE 2 compared with the meloxicam group, although the model did not induce a relevant amount of lameness. Both nutraceuticals resulted in significantly lower synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE 2 compared with placebo. No statistical differences in IL- 6, GAGs, CPII or MMPs were observed among treatment groups. No adverse effects were observed. Main limitations: Despite evidence of synovitis, lameness was too mild to detect. Conclusions: The preventive administration of these nutraceuticals showed anti-inflammatory effects in this validated synovitis model. Therefore, further studies of their clinical applicability are warranted...|$|E

40|$|A case of {{simultaneous}} {{fracture of}} the carpal scaphoid and trapezium is reported and {{the mechanism of}} injury is considered. Fracture of the scaphoid is the commonest carpal fracture (Borgeskov, 1966; Dunn, 1972). Only rarely is it accompanied by a fracture of an adjacent bone (Borgeskov, 1966). In a recent series of 161 patients with fractures of the scaphoid, 7 % suffered simultaneous fracture of a neighbouring bone (M 611 er, 1983). By far the commonest associated fracture {{was that of the}} distal radius. There was no case of an associated fracture of the trapezium. Case Report A twenty-one-year-old male motorcyclist was involved in an accident in which his motorcycle collided with the side of a car. He was thrown over the roof of the car and on to the road; the exact mechanism of his injuries could not be established as he was unconscious briefly and does not remember any details. There were fractures involving the right wrist and right femur. Neither injury was compound and there was no neurovascular complication. X-rays of the right wrist and hand showed an undisplaced fracture of the waist of the scaphoid and an undisplaced vertical fracture of the trapezium (Figure 1). X-rays of the right femur showed a transverse fracture of the middle third of the shaft. Fig. 1 Initial x-ray film showing a transverse fracture of the scaphoid and vertical fracture of the trapezium. After resuscitation, his right wrist was immobilised in a scaphoid plaster cast. His fractured femur was internally fixed with a Ktintscher nail two weeks after the accident. Serial x-rays of the right wrist showed that the scaphoid and trapezium fractures remained undisplaced. After six weeks the scaphoid cast was removed and there was clinical and radiological evidence of union of the fractures of the scaphoid and trapezium (Figure 2). He was encouraged to mobilise the wrist; by sixteen weeks he had a full range of movement of the wrist and thumb and normal grip.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{sensitivity}} of ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for the evaluation of the integrity of spontaneously repaired horse cartilage. Articular surfaces of horse <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joints,</b> featuring both intact tissue and spontaneously healed chondral or osteochondral defects, were imaged ex vivo with arthroscopic ultrasound and laboratory OCT devices. Quantitative ultrasound (integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), apparent integrated backscattering coefficient (AIB) and ultrasound roughness index (URI)) and optical parameters (optical reflection coefficient (ORC), optical roughness index (ORI) and optical backscattering (OBS)) were determined and compared with histological integrity and mechanical properties of the tissue. Spontaneously healed tissue could be quantitatively discerned from the intact tissue with ultrasound and OCT techniques. Furthermore, several significant correlations (p< 0. 05) were detected between ultrasound and OCT parameters. Superior resolution of OCT provided a more accurate measurement of cartilage surface roughness, while the ultrasound backscattering from the inner structures of the cartilage matched better with the histological findings.

X-rays, US and MRI of the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were performed in 30 patients with early RA who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA. Eight localities (MCP II-V, radiocarpal, radioulnar <b>joints,</b> <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joints</b> and involvement of the tendons in hands) were evaluated for pathologic inflammatory changes (together 240 localities). The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. Each patient underwent blood tests: erythrocytes sedimentation rate, the level of hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, blood proteins, and electrophoresis of the blood proteins. It is statistically significant that MRI was more sensitive than US and CR in detecting inflammatory soft tissue lesions and bone changes. US was more sensitive method than CR in soft tissue pathology, but less sensitive in bone erosions detection.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} ultrasonographic abnormalities of the hand and wrist of asymptomatic patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and compare these findings with those from patients with SLE with musculoskeletal signs or symptoms and healthy controls. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study that evaluated bilaterally, with grey-scale and power Doppler (PD) ultrasound (US), the dorsal hand (2 nd to 5 th metacarpophalangeal and 2 nd to 5 th proximal interphalangeal joints) and wrist (radiocarpal, ulnocarpal and <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joints)</b> of 30 asymptomatic patients with SLE, 6 symptomatic patients with SLE and 10 controls. Synovial hypertrophy (SH) and intra-articular PD signal were scored using semiquantitative grading scales (0 - 3). Individual scores were graded as normal (SH≤ 1 and PD= 0) or abnormal (SH≥ 2 or PD≥ 1). Global indexes for SH and PD were also calculated. US findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory data and disease activity indexes. RESULTS: US detected SH (score ≥ 1) in 77 % asymptomatic patients with SLE, mostly graded as minimal (score 1 : 63 %). 23 % of the asymptomatic patients with SLE showed abnormal US PD findings (SH≥ 2 or PD≥ 1). SH was present in all symptomatic patients with SLE, mostly graded as moderate (grade 2 : 67 %), and with associated PD signal (83 %). SH (score 1) was identified in 50 % of controls, however, none presented abnormal US PD findings. SH index in the asymptomatic SLE group was {{higher than in the}} control group (2. 0 (0 - 5) vs 0. 5 (0 - 2), median (range), p= 0. 01) and lower than in the symptomatic SLE group (7. 0 (4 - 23), median (range), p< 0. 001). No significant correlation was demonstrated between US PD findings and clinical or laboratory variables and disease activity indexes.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to criticize the {{selectivity}} of intrasynovial injections into the distal interphalangeal joint, the navicular bursa, the digital flexor tendon sheath, the fetlock joint, the carpal synovial sheath as well as the joints of the carpus and tarsus. Therefore different synovial institutions of 57 fresh limbs of horses were alternately filled with 0. 15 % Disulfinblau solution, the legs were placed in a freezer at minus 21 °C and afterwards transversial saw cuts were made. Subsequently an anatomical evaluation of the spread of the injected substance in the saw cuts was undertaken and documented photographically. Disulfinblau and local anaesthetics were assumpted to have an analogical pattern of distribution, both substances were placed on a par and therefore possible anesthetized regions would show a blue colouration. As results of this study after the singular intrasynovial injections certain blue- coloured regions have occurred. They originate from communication relationships and from direct infiltration, including an unilateral or both side colouration of the big nerve trunks. Especially in terms of possible perineural infiltration an anaesthesia of the distal interphalangeal joint seems to be able to additional desensibilize the navicular bursa, the navicular bone and its suspensory ligaments, the distal phalanx, distal parts of the deep digital flexor tendon and parts of the corium of the wall and sole. Similar regions would be achieved with an anaesthesia of the navicular bursa. The injection of the digital flexor tendon sheath is even able to reach a much bigger field by anaesthesia of the palmar or plantar nerves. As a consequence it should be considered, that diagnostic anaesthesias of all synovial structures in the region of the digit are too uncertain for exact localization of the navicular syndrome. Because of its ligamentous apparatus the fetlock joint is up to occasional exceptions resistant to diffusion and its anaesthesia seems to be relative selective. Yet the proximal sesamoideal bones were not anesthetized for sure. Whereas the injection of the radiocarpal joint hardly could lead to a spread of the local anaesthetic on the nerve branches of the median or ulnar nerve, the injection of the carpal synovial sheath can possibly act as a perineural infiltration. This would exceed the effects of a high palmar nerve block anesthesia. An anaesthesia of the <b>intercarpal</b> <b>joints</b> is assumpted to include the origin of the suspensory ligament and the accessory ligament. This seems to be based on a partial direct infiltration and/or a possible block of the palmar metacarpal nerves. Similar results should be expected for the plantar metatarsal nerves after injection of the distal tarsal joints. If this is the case it has to be considered for therapeutical purposes, that an intrasynovial medication is on no account sure to completely affect this region. Furthermore diagnostic anaesthesias of the tarsus are able to reach the N. fibularis profundus, which is followed by a block of the dorsal metatarsal nerves. While using diagnostic intrasynovial anaesthesia at least a certain degree of scepticism relating to their selectivity should be kept in the back of the practitioners mind. However they are despite sometimes confusing results an indispensable part of the lameness examination and in most cases and if correct interpretated an inestimable support...|$|R
