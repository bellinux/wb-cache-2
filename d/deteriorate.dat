Chang et al. (2010) investigated optimal ordering policies for <b>deteriorating</b> items using a discounted cash-flow analysis when trade credit {{is linked to}} order quantity. Wu et al. (2006) investigated non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> inventory model with stock-dependent demand. Further, Ouyang et al. (2006) developed model for non-instantaneous <b>deteriorating</b> items with permissible delay in payments. Yang and Wee (2002, 2003) have conducted research on the inventory policy for <b>deteriorating</b> item in the supply chain including a single vendor and multi-buyers. Yang and Wee (2002) developed a multi-lot-size production and inventory model for <b>deteriorating</b> items with constant production and demand rates.

30|$|<b>Deteriorating</b> rate {{is another}} {{key factor in}} the study of <b>deteriorating</b> items inventory, which {{describes}} the deterioration nature of the items. When it comes to the study of <b>deteriorating</b> rate, there are several situations. In the early stage of the study, most of the <b>deteriorating</b> rates in the models are constant, such as Ghare and Schrader (1963), Shah and Jaiswal (1977), Aggarwal (1978), Padmanabhana and Vratb (1995), and Bhunia and Maiti (1999). In recent research, more and more studies have begun to consider the relationship between time and <b>deteriorating</b> rate. In this situation there are several scenarios: <b>deteriorating</b> rate is a linear increasing function of time (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2004), <b>deteriorating</b> rate is three-parameter Weibull distributed (Chakrabarty et al. 1998), and <b>deteriorating</b> rate is other function of time (Abad 2001).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> systems. A model for stiffness degrading or <b>deteriorating</b> systems is used to describe six different singledegree- of -freedom systems. A numerical investigation of the response of these six systems is performed using an ensemble of twelve earthquakes. The response is studied at nine nominal periods of oscillation. The numerical results are presented as response spectra corresponding to six different ductilities. An approximate analytical method for calculating the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> systems from a linear response spectrum is presented. The method, called the average stiffness and energy method, is based upon the premise that a linear system may be defined which is in some sense equivalent to the <b>deteriorating</b> system. The criterion for equivalence in this method is that the average stiffness of the <b>deteriorating</b> system be equal to the stiffness of the linear system and the average energy dissipated by the linear system be the same as the average energy dissipated by the <b>deteriorating</b> system. The new analytical method is compared to existing methods. Comparison with the numerical results is also made. Based upon these comparisons, it is concluded that the average stiffness and energy method represents a significant improvement over currently available methods for predicting the earthquake response of <b>deteriorating</b> and nondeteriorating systems...|$|R
