5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing)</b> and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon {{in the side of}} a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear war, or {{at least}} {{deployed}} nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut's novels. In Player Piano, the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal, and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In Cat's Cradle, John's original purpose in setting pen to paper is to write an account of what prominent Americans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> as Hiroshima was bombed.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting the Conservatives, while the native Africans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> {{the same with}} Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of the}} Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E

5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> {{on the set of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|At Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi {{worked closely}} with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A {{building}} block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony Music <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> with Music Discs. The final two key members of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York-based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the mother company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA).|$|E

Brown, a dealer in Stradivarius instruments, arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the Baron Knoop Stradivarius. In April 1929, Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour, and in May, Sir James Gunnson, a former Mayor of Auckland, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand. The next January, Herbert Hagerman, former Governor of New Mexico Territory; author Basil Woon, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate William Easterwood all sailed stateside on the ship.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting and the banks were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E
