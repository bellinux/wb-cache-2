5|$|The low-end {{model was}} sold with 1MB memory, a 1.44 MB floppy drive, no <b>hard</b> <b>disk,</b> and {{included}} a keyboard for $999. The high-end model cost $1,499 but contained an additional 1MB memory expansion card and a 40MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in this category, {{there is}} TuneUp Disk Doctor. It can check the {{integrity}} of files stored on <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives and salvage damaged files. It can also scan for physical defects known as bad sectors and isolate them. TuneUp Disk Doctor is a graphical replacement for Windows CHKDSK.|$|E
50|$|Usually server <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> are {{specified}} {{for less}} spinup cycles than desktop <b>hard</b> <b>disks,</b> because servers are only very rarely rebooted. On the other hand, server <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> have much higher MTBF.|$|R
5000|$|SpeedFan {{offers a}} feature named [...] "in-depth online analysis" [...] that compares the <b>hard</b> <b>disk's</b> S.M.A.R.T. data to a {{database}} with statistical models of <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> allowing {{early detection of}} potentially degraded <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> Messages inform the user of specific situations and problems, which Almico says is “as if a human expert had looked at the data”.|$|R

5|$|BitLocker is {{a logical}} volume {{encryption}} system. (A volume spans part of a <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive, the whole drive or more than one drive.) When enabled, TPM and BitLocker can ensure {{the integrity of the}} trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS and boot sector), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector malware.|$|E
5|$|Hardware {{requirements}} for the product depend on the operating system; on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7, it requires a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, a computer monitor with a display resolution of at least 800 × 600 pixels, 200MB of free <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> space and an Internet connection.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 adds native game {{recording}} and screenshot capture ability using the newly introduced game bar.

5000|$|At system start, {{only the}} BIOS drivers are {{available}} for LILO to access <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> For this reason, a very old BIOS access area is limited to cylinders 0 to 1023 {{of the first two}} <b>hard</b> <b>disks.</b> For a later BIOS, LILO can use 32-bit [...] "logical block addressing" [...] (LBA) to access the entire capacity of the <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> the BIOS has access to.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} sector size for harddisks today is 512 bytes, {{but there have}} been <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> with 520 bytes per sector as well for non-IBM compatible machines. In 2005 some Seagate custom <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> used sector sizes of 1024 bytes per sector. Advanced Format <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> use 4096 bytes per physical sector (4Kn) since 2010, but will also be able to emulate 512 byte sectors (512e) for a transitional period.|$|R

5|$|Of the 218tonnes of {{platinum}} sold in 2014, 98tonnes {{were used}} for vehicle emissions control devices (45%), 74.7tonnes for jewelry (34%), 20.0tonnes for chemical production and petroleum refining (9.2%), and 5.85tonnes for electrical applications such as <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives (2.7%). The remaining 28.9tonnes went to various other minor applications, such as medicine and biomedicine, glassmaking equipment, investment, electrodes, anticancer drugs, oxygen sensors, spark plugs and turbine engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of International Velvet, and the heavy touring that followed, the band were pleased {{to return to the}} Monnow Valley Studio to record a third studio album. On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band felt less pressure on them for the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because they no longer feared being dropped by the label.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} of using stationary MR heads was later developed by OnStream {{for use as}} a data storage media for computers. MR heads are now also commonly used in <b>hard</b> <b>disks,</b> although <b>hard</b> <b>disks</b> now use the GMR variant, whereas DCCs use the earlier AMR.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, Sony {{released}} the first useful and fully functioning operating {{system for a}} video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors {{as well as a}} USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive and Ethernet port.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> onto separate media, its {{time will be}} set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
