50|$|In sum, {{this system}} tunes the major thirds to the just ratio of 5:4 (so, for instance, if A4 is tuned to 440 Hz, C5 is tuned to 550 Hz), {{most of the}} whole tones (namely the major seconds) in the ratio :2, {{and most of the}} semitones (namely the {{diatonic}} semitones or minor seconds) in the ratio 8:5. This is achieved by tuning the seventeenth a syntonic comma flatter than the Pythagorean seventeenth, which implies tuning the <b>fifth</b> a <b>quarter</b> of a syntonic comma flatter than the just ratio of 3:2. It is this that gives the system its name of quarter-comma meantone.|$|R
6000|$|That <b>fifth</b> <b>quarter</b> was {{a painful}} {{one in every}} way. Faiz-Ullah played like a little red demon, and The Rabbit seemed to be {{everywhere}} at once, and Benami rode straight at anything and everything that came in his way; while the umpires on their ponies wheeled like gulls outside the shifting game. But the Archangels had the better mounts,--they had kept their racers till late in the game,--and never allowed the Skidars to play football. They hit the ball {{up and down the}} width of the ground till Benami and the rest were outpaced. Then they went forward, and time and again Lutyens and Grey Dawn were just, and only just, able to send the ball away with a long, spitting backhander. Grey Dawn forgot that he was an Arab; and turned from grey to blue as he galloped. Indeed, he forgot too well, for he did not keep his eyes on the ground as an Arab should, but stuck out his nose and scuttled for the dear honour of the game. They had watered the ground once or twice between the quarters, and a careless waterman had emptied the last of his skinful all in one place near the Skidars' goal. It was close {{to the end of the}} play, and for the tenth time Grey Dawn was bolting after the ball, when his near hind-foot slipped on the greasy mud, and he rolled over and over, pitching Lutyens just clear of the goal-post; and the triumphant Archangels made their goal. Then [...] "time" [...] was called-two goals all; but Lutyens had to be helped up, and Grey Dawn rose with his near hind-leg strained somewhere.|$|E

The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of its Android operating system, which had been the subject of numerous patent infringement lawsuits between device vendors and other companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Oracle.|$|R

40|$|Disease {{management}} emphasizes {{prevention of}} disease-related exacerbations and complications using evidence-based guidelines and patient empowerment tools. It can help manage {{and improve the}} health status of a defined patient population over the entire course of a disease. More than 20 states in the US are developing and implementing Medicaid disease management programs. While most are in {{an early stage of}} development, a small number of states were pioneers in disease management and have already gained much insight. Among them, three states - Florida, Virginia, and West Virginia - provide some significant lessons. In the late 1990 s, Florida The Virginia Health Outcomes Project was shown to be effective in reducing use of emergency and urgent care services by Medicaid patients with asthma (average 42 % reduction in the third to <b>fifth</b> <b>quarters</b> after introduction of the program) and increasing the appropriate use of asthma medications. It was also shown to be cost effective, with projected direct savings to Medicaid of $US 3 - 5 (2002 values) for every incremental dollar spent providing disease management support to physicians. The goals of the West Virginia Health Initiatives Project were to deliver quality care, improve health status and quality of life, and ensure the efficient and appropriate utilization of resources for Medicaid patients with diabetes. The model program had two critical components: (i) adaptation of clinical treatment guidelines that are in the public domain to blend the highest quality of care with the best practical management strategies; and (ii) feedback reports that provide real-time data about patients It {{would be a mistake to}} attempt to draw firm conclusions about disease management programs for low-income elderly or physically disabled patients in the US Medicaid program given their current stage of development. However, credit should be given to the states that are experimenting with cutting-edge programs to tackle not only their fiscal issues, but perhaps more importantly, the issue of ensuring high-quality, cost-effective healthcare for the patients they serve.
