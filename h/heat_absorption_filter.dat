The effects of the melting parameter, micropolar parameter <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> parameter and stretching parameter on the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics have been tabulated, illustrated graphically and discussed in detail.

40|$|A recent {{thermodynamic}} model describes a reversible reaction between cholesterol (C) and phospholipid (P) {{to form a}} condensed complex C(nq) P(np). Here q and p are relatively prime integers used to define the stoichiometric composition, and n {{is a measure of}} cooperativity. The present study applies this model to the scanning calorimetry of binary mixtures of cholesterol and saturated phosphatidylcholines, especially work by McElhaney and collaborators. These mixtures generally show two heat capacity peaks, a sharp peak and a broad peak. The sharp <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> is largely due to the chain melting transition of pure phospholipid. In the present work the broad <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> is attributed to the thermal dissociation of complexes. The best fits of the model to the data require the complex formation to be highly cooperative, with cooperativity n = 12. Detailed comparisons are made between model calculations and calorimetric data. A number of unusual features of the data arise naturally in the model. The principal discrepancy between the calculations and experimental results is a spurious calculated <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> peak. This discrepancy is related to the reported relative magnitudes of the integrated broad and sharp <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> curves...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Absorption</b> <b>filters</b> {{dissipate}} {{the energy}} in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. This {{is in contrast}} to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. An <b>absorption</b> <b>filter</b> may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed.

Numerical computations are performed for air (Pr = 0. 7) and displayed graphically to illustrate the influence of relevant physical parameters on local skin friction and heat transfer coefficients and, also on, velocity and temperature fields. It is observed that the heat generation decreases the heat transfer whereas <b>heat</b> <b>absorption</b> does the opposite. Further, heat generation reduces the thickness of thermal boundary layer, whereas it increases due to <b>heat</b> <b>absorption.</b> It is also observed that the heat transfer coefficient and temperature fields are strongly affected due to thermal radiation...|$|R

Details about our spectral color imaging system description, imaging procedures and the performance of spectral estimation methods used can be found in our previous technical reports. 1, 2 In previous reports we focused in methods of reconstruction from narrow-band images using LCTF, while we only reported preliminary analyses of reconstruction from wide-band images using six glass filtered images and a red-green-blue filter combined with and without a light-blue Wratten filter.
