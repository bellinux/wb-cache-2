50|$|The car {{is now at}} Esplanade Bridge {{crossing}} the Singapore river, building up speed to 285 km/h. Turn 14 almost meets turn eight, diverting to the right at 78 km/h onto the Raffles Avenue (in front of Esplanade). Next, a series of mostly blind corners from turn 15 to 19. The cars approach {{to the front of}} the floating platform grandstand (turn 16 and 17), then goes under the floating platform grandstand (turn 18 and 19) at 80 km/h. At turn 18, cars must turn in at a specific angle, otherwise will brush or crash along the wall. Turn 20 and 21 is just right after Bayfront Avenue; a right-hand turn 20, then a left-hand turn 21 that leads the car towards turn 22. How fast the cars approach turn 22 is determined by the exit of turn 21, therefore most of the drivers <b>exit</b> <b>turn</b> 21 very close to the wall to gain a speed advantage. Running down towards turn 22 passes the 165m tall Singapore Flyer, where turn 22 and 23 is taken flat-out at about 180 km/h before picking up the throttle again towards the pit straight across the finish line.|$|E
50|$|Turn 1 is {{the main}} {{overtaking}} point at Catalunya, {{as it is a}} braking zone {{at the end of a}} long DRS straight. The inside and outside are equally difficult for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two. The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane - drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible. Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve. Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza's Curva Parabolica - drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying lots of speed out of the <b>exit.</b> <b>Turn</b> 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars. Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane. Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars' suspensions. Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely blind (drivers cannot see the apex on approach). It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf. The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a second-gear, left-hand hairpin, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right. The next section has been redesigned by German engineer Hermann Tilke to lower speeds onto the 1,047-metre pit straight - which in turn increases overtaking opportunities and safety. Turn 13 is a tight, third-gear right-hander and drivers have to cross the track quickly to take the racing line through the slow left-right chicane of turns 14 and 15, taken in second gear. Good traction is needed here as it determines speed down the pit straight. Turn 16 (New Holland) is a flat-out right-hander which takes cars across the start/finish line.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} a high-pressure-ratio, low-flow turbogenerator with 50 W electrical power output, designed to operate from a 5 -bar air supply. The research shows that a MEMS-based silicon turbine in combination with a micro-machined generator can meet the design objectives of the turbogenerator. The turbogenerator architecture comprises a single-stage radial inflow turbine and a direct coupled cylindrical permanent-magnet synchronous generator. To address its key design trade-offs and fundamental engineering challenges, the design space is first explored in terms of the key design variables: device diameter and rotor shaft speed. To guide the selection of the two variables, a simplified model for the scaling of turbine and generator power is developed. Next, the integrated turbine and generator design is analyzed and designed in detail. The minimum manufacturable turbine blade span is identified as the key challenge imposed by the low flow requirement. Furthermore, the small scale of the blades results in high rotational speeds. Since the turbine and generator are integrated, the high speed makes the generator design challenging because of manufacturing tolerances, material stress limitations and losses. Thus, the design trade-off is between generator complexity and turbine blade manufacturability. The analysis shows that the viable low-flow 50 W turbogenerator design space is narrowly constrained by the minimum blade span and the 5 -bar pressure supply, demanding MEMS fabrication for the short turbine blades. A single-stage MEMS radial turbine is designed in detail, and assessed for performance and manufacturability. The rotor speed at design conditions is 450, 000 rpm with a rotor radius of 5 mm, a rotor blade span of 200 um, and a blade tip clearance of 20 um. (cont.) Based on 3 D RANS simulations, the turbine is predicted to achieve 48 % total-to-static adiabatic efficiency and to produce 77 W of shaft power at a turbine mass flow of 1. 45 g/s. Assuming a generator efficiency of 80 % and a power electronics efficiency of 90 % yields a net electrical turbogenerator power output of 50 W. End-wall losses are dominant in the planar turbine and a diffuser is included to reduce the pressure losses in the right <b>exit</b> <b>turn.</b> The final high-speed, low flow design integrates a MEMS turbine and a meso-scale permanent-magnet synchronous generator combined with hybrid ball bearings. by Stevan Jovanovic.
