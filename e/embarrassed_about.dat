5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
5|$|Emily, {{disguised}} as her twin sister Katie, arrives at college to take Katie's history exam. In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> how her injuries look, and miserable {{over the loss of}} her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is speechless, while Katie tries to deny it.

500|$|... "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Lady Gaga, from her third EP, The Fame Monster. Inspired by Gaga's [...] "Fear of Self Monster", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who likes {{to have sex with}} the lights off because she is <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings. The song was initially planned to be released after [...] "Telephone", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, [...] "Alejandro" [...] was released instead.

500|$|Ryo {{found it}} {{difficult}} at first to write [...] "tenderhearted" [...] lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women. When describing the lyrics for his songs using Hatsune Miku as the vocalist, Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best, because the singer, as a computer program, would not feel <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> singing the lyrics. He admitted that his friends would laugh when he played the songs, but he thought that [...] "if a 16-year-old girl {{is supposed to be}} singing...it is best if she sings about romance." [...] When writing lyrics for human singers, Ryo takes more care in writing lyrics that singers would not be embarrassed to sing. When Ryo receives an offer to compose theme music, he writes lyrics that tie in with the theme and mood of the given work, such as the ending themes [...] "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari" [...] for the anime Bakemonogatari, and [...] "Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni" [...] for the visual novel Mahōtsukai no Yoru.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV, [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] was {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released after [...] "Telephone", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, [...] "Alejandro" [...] was released instead.

Gaga told Los Angeles Times that the inspiration behind [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] as being the intimate experience taking place between two people alone in a bedroom, the fear of Sex Monster. According to her, the record is about a girl who likes {{to have sex with}} the lights off, because she is <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> her body. [...] "She doesn't want her man to see her naked. She will be free, and she will let her inner animal out, but only when the lights are out," [...] Gaga explained. She added that like the song, she has to struggle with issues of body image and self-doubt in her own life. While working on the MAC AIDS Fund, she realized that women of her age do not speak their mind, in fear that their boyfriends would not love them if they did so.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2008, Beckinsale {{starred in}} Nothing but the Truth as a {{journalist}} who refuses to reveal her source.

Times with some female reporters, and I spoke to Judith Miller about her experience....I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played [...] "two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working {{at the top of her}} game." [...] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance.

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} album's {{extensive}} exploration of sexuality. Having been a singer {{since the age}} of nine, Beyoncé felt [...] "stifled" [...] by the perception she was a role model for young children, and now into her thirties, believed she had [...] "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of self". Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, the singer said [...] "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> it and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me." [...] Several critics described Beyoncés sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship. It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass, skittering synthesizers and drums, and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios. Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse. [...] "Blow" [...] veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a [...] "swinging electro-funk groove" [...] with elements of neo-disco. Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of [...] "licking Skittles" [...] in its chorus. The slow-jam [...] "Rocket" [...] is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). Described by Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci as a [...] "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion", Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.|$|E
500|$|Mike Simpson, Creative Assembly's studio director, {{started a}} blog in October 2009, in a {{deliberate}} attempt {{to engage with}} the game's user community and counter some of the negative reaction which the game had received. He explained The Creative Assembly [...] "were not entirely happy {{with the state of}} Empire: Total War when it went out", but felt the Metacritic user rating of 67 percent was unfair, stating that his reason for blogging was a concern that the negative ratings could even damage the amount of money available for developing future games. In later posts he described the February 2009 release date as [...] "commercial reality", and explained why they had hit significant problems with the game's AI close to release. Simpson describes the campaign AI as [...] "by far the most complex code edifice I’ve ever seen in a game", and said that they had reached a tipping point where consideration of too many factors led to an AI which [...] "disagrees with itself chronically and often ends up paralysed by indecision". It was only after patch 1.5—six months after the original release—that Simpson felt comfortable sending it to friends of his, having previously been too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>about</b> the flaws. With regard to the battle AI, Simpson said that the lead battle AI programmer had left to return to his family just {{before the end of the}} project. The battle AI at that stage struggled to beat good players even with an obvious level of handicapping, and it had taken some time for other programmers to understand three years' worth of code; progress had been [...] "frustratingly slow" [...] as they strived for a game where real world tactics would work.|$|E
