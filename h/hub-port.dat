For the AHP, 5 main criteria and 16 sub-criteria are determined through the conducted {{studies in the}} literature review by taking consideration the characteristic features of the region. The comparison of criterion is conducted by service providers which are port users, ocean carrier operators and other service providers in the region. The obtained survey results are applied to pre-determined 3 candidate ports which are Piraeus Port (Greece), Candarli Port (Turkey) and Gioia Port (Italy). The AHP model gives the best score to Piraeus Port with Candarli Port facility taking second place...|$|E

Studies indicate that, by 2016, a new port north of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) should be operational, serving, as a regional hub, {{the needs of the}} total (captive and non-captive) hinterland of East African ports. The objective {{of this article is to}} assess the economic potential, in terms of logistics costs of alternative <b>hub-port</b> locations. To that effect we first describe the flow of goods in the Nairobi – Durban port range and the landlocked countries; the available inland transport options; and the related transport costs and quality of service aspects. The inland and maritime transport costs are investigated and compared next, for the import-export routings of 18 different trade combinations between six landlocked countries (Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DRC Great Lakes/Copper Belt, Zambia and Malawi) and five ports (Mombasa, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Beira and Nacala). The article estimates the parameters of a multinomial logit model by comparing the differences in logistics costs of routings via Dar es Salaam and other ports. A port demand function is derived as a result. The article concludes that, in view of its distance from the arterial maritime container trade routes, the new port could only function as a regional lower-tier hub and distribution centre for the trade of Tanzania and Kenya, and of landlocked countries ranging from Uganda in the north to Zambia in the south. At present, this role is mostly played by ports in the Middle East, whereas East African ports serve merely as transit points. ...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation and the {{development}} of the international transport network have increased the role of ports as nodes in the global logistics and supply chain systems. Meanwhile, seaports encounter great challenges, uncertainties and risks than ever before. The development of different markets has contributed to intensifying competition in the port industry (Haezendonck & Notteboom, 2002). The reform of liner shipping service networks as well as the increased bargaining power of the shipping lines, has contributed to the deterioration of existing ports and to {{the development}} of new ones which, in turn, causes change in market structure and port hierarchy. Container ports, in particular, have not only encountered competition from the large load centers in the same port range but also from the medium and small load centers having the same hinterland and, to some extent, from load centers in other port ranges. The hub-and-spoke system that has emerged in liner shipping operation patterns has increased pressure on the supply chain network around load centers. Thus, the concept of containerisation has enlarged the geographical coverage of seaports {{to the extent that the}} concept of a captive market is no longer valid. The aim of this paper is to assess the competitiveness level of <b>hub-ports</b> and to analyse the impact of inter-port competition on the Mediterranean container market structure. In doing so, the research is divided into five sections. The first section comprises a general introduction that includes research aims and the research plan. The second section reviews the literature related to port competition and the methodologies being used to assess ports’ competitiveness. The third section demonstrates the area of study, research problem and methodologies used to measure the impact of port competitiveness on the Mediterranean port market structure. The fourth section assesses the competitiveness of <b>hub-ports</b> in the Mediterranean container market. The last section introduces a comprehensive conclusion for the research outcomes...|$|R
