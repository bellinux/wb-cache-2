5|$|The bee-eaters <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> World distribution, {{occurring}} from Europe to Australia. The {{centre of}} {{diversity of the}} family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European bee-eater), Australia (the rainbow bee-eater) and Madagascar (the olive bee-eater, also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, Merops, which has {{the majority of the}} species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. Nyctyornis is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus Meropogon has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{family had}} been thought to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> World origin {{notwithstanding}} the current richness of the family, which is more diverse in the Neotropical New World. DNA evidence seemed to support an African origin for the trogons, with the African genus Apaloderma seemingly basal in the family, {{and the other two}} lineages, the Asian and American, breaking off between 20–36 million years ago. More recent studies show that the DNA evidence gives contradictory results concerning the basal phylogenetic relationships; so it is currently unknown if all extant trogons are descended from an African or an American ancestor or neither.|$|E
25|$|The Giants <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> and storied {{rivalry with}} the Redskins, {{dating back to}} 1932. While this rivalry is {{typically}} given less significance than the rivalries with the Eagles and Cowboys, there have been periods of great competition between the two. In the 1980s the Giants and Redskins clashed as both struggled against each other for division titles and even Super Bowl Championships. Most notable among these is the 1986 NFC Championship game in which the Giants defeated the Redskins 17–0 to earn their first ever trip to the Super Bowl. Wellington Mara always felt this was the Giants oldest and truest rival, and after passing away in 2005, the Giants honored their longtime owner by defeating the Redskins 36–0 at home. The Giants lead this series 98–66–4. The Giants 98 wins against the Redskins are tied for most wins against another franchise in NFL history, along with the Chicago Bears defeating the Detroit Lions 98 times.|$|E

25|$|Urdu {{has been}} one of the premier {{languages}} of poetry in South Asia for two centuries, and has developed a rich tradition in a variety of poetic genres. The Ghazal in Urdu represents the most popular form of subjective music and poetry, whereas the Nazm exemplifies the objective kind, often reserved for narrative, descriptive, didactic or satirical purposes. Under the broad head of the Nazm we may also include the classical forms of poems known by specific names such as Masnavi (a long narrative poem in rhyming couplets on any theme: romantic, religious, or didactic), Marsia (an elegy traditionally meant to commemorate the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad, and his comrades of the Karbala fame), or Qasida (a panegyric written in praise of a king or a nobleman), for all these poems have a single presiding subject, logically developed and concluded. However, these poetic species <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> world aura about their subject and style, and are different from the modern Nazm, supposed to have come into vogue in the later part of the nineteenth century. Probably the most widely recited, and memorised genre of contemporary Urdu poetry is nāt—panegyric poetry written in praise of Muhammad. Nāt can be of any formal category, but is most commonly in the ghazal form. The language used in Urdu nāt ranges from the intensely colloquial to a highly persified formal language. The great early 20th century scholar Ala Hazrat, Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi, who wrote many of the most well known nāts in Urdu (the collection of his poetic work is Hadaiq-e-Baqhshish), epitomised this range in a ghazal of nine stanzas (bayt) in which every stanza contains half a line each of Arabic, Persian, formal Urdu, and colloquial Hindi.|$|E

[...] As the dance finishes, he realizes the other dancers have stopped and are watching them, his [...] "leonine air" [...] preventing the onlookers from bursting into applause. Angelica asks him to eat with her and Tancredi, and for a flattered moment almost says yes, but then again remembers his youth, recalls how embarrassing it would have been for him to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> relative eating with him and a lover, and politely excuses himself.|$|E

They <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> woman villager {{take it to a}} monk they suspect is Mizushima in hiding. She returns the next day with another parrot that says [...] "No, I cannot go back". [...] She also gives the captain a letter, that explains that Mizushima has decided not to go back to Japan with them, because he must continue burying the dead while studying as a monk and promoting the peaceful nature of mankind. He states in the letter that if he finishes burying all the fallen soldiers' bodies, then he may return to Japan.|$|E

2500|$|The first façade of Number 3-7 {{dates back}} to the 1760s with many later additions; for example, the large {{northern}} window was {{the same size as the}} small southern until the 1960s, while its large 18th-century shutters show there once was a door here. [...] In contrast, the plain façades of Number 5 and 7 <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> feeling but is mostly a product of a later restorations: [...] in 1963 the old mouldings and two of the original four windows of N.5 were removed, and the door of N.7 was placed where the southern window now is until the mid-1930s. [...] The second alley, Skeppar Karls Gränd is named after Skipper Karl, who bought a building in the alley in the 16th century, the alley at the time facing the big fish market and the adjacent waterfront where his ships were moored.|$|E

But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Thornhill, Connecticut – {{the village}} near which the Austins live {{in most of}} the books. The Austin home is akin to the Murry {{farmhouse}} and to Crosswicks in size, age and environs; for example, all three have a [...] "star-watching rock" [...] out back. The Austin house is outside Thornhill, {{at the end of a}} dirt road that intersects the [...] "old Boston Post Road". [...] The Austins <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> barn, in which Vicky's brother John works on building a mock-up of a space suit. Dr. Austin sees patients a few evenings a week in his office at one end of the house, which has its own entrance. A short drive from the Austin house is Hawk Mountain (apparently a fictionalized version of Mohawk Mountain near Cornwall, Connecticut), another place the family goes to talk and look at stars. The nearby town is Clovenford, where Dr. Austin works at the regional hospital. The state in which Thornhill is located is not initially given, but in The Moon by Night John Austin tells Zachary Gray that the family is from Connecticut. L'Engle and her family, the Franklins, lived in a similar Connecticut locale when Meet the Austins was written. In a 1995 introduction to the Austin family paperbacks, L'Engle states that [...] "Indeed, the Austins do a great many things that my family did, including living in a small dairy farm village." [...] L'Engle also mentions Clovenford in a fictional incident in A Circle of Quiet (p.87).|$|E
2500|$|Berry's love of North Staffordshire {{was deep}} and permanent; he indulged an incurable {{addiction}} to the place. He [...] "had an inexplicable attraction to the place and...was attached to the area by [...] "an invisible umbilical cord", which could never be cut." [...] He said of his childhood [...] "every house seemed to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> woman, a drunken man, a gang of kids and a snarling dog." [...] Certainly then he was, [...] "a thinker {{of the working class}} who developed a love of middle class pursuits." [...] He said he had [...] "always worked out of one world, the working class world of which I am part", while declaring, [...] "I am a man of habit and pattern." [...] He [...] "became a cult figure following many television appearances in the Midlands." [...] His attachment to the place was a legend. For example, [...] "when he obtained work as a teacher in Chelsea College of Art he commuted every day and night from Biddulph Moor." [...] And indeed [...] "propping up the bar at his local public house...is where he felt most comfortable." [...] Yet it was during the 1950s that the, [...] "crushing black agoraphobia descended on him, virtually imprisoning him in North Staffordshire {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] But as a man, poet, playwright and artist he came into his own. Peter Cheeseman (Director, for thirty five years, of the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent and, latterly, the New Victoria Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme), recalls the many animated conversations they had enjoyed, and [...] "the swift gestures of his good left arm, banging at the elbow of his useless right...and the rich talk that pours out of him." [...] He was [...] "eloquent in every way...a vigorous and expressive poet...a writer of stories, a dramatist...grotesquely hilarious... an inspiring teacher of art, loved and admired by his students." [...] He was [...] "a large, ungainly and glum man, tall and remote, cloth cap sitting permanently over his expressionless face." [...] He seemed to have something of a love-hate relationship with his art, for [...] "he once sent a groaning van-load off to Stoke tip: a great weight lifted off me." [...] He was really [...] "a painter and poet of the cluttered and dying landscape of pits and ironworks...he writes of that world with unexpected imagery and a great roaring sense of humour, sometimes wry, often grotesque." [...] As a painter, he strained [...] "to paint a world he loved passionately for its vigour and its energy and its richness before the bulldozer scraped it away." [...] He felt his paintings to be [...] "the most eloquent utterances, portraits of a world seen from the bottom of my rut." [...] This was indeed [...] "a world filled with images of people and landscape that have been twisted and worn into strange shapes by hard work and poverty. My Parthenon is an allotment hut knocked together out of bits of rubbish. It is the richness of poor things that I am drawn to." [...] As he told Peter Cheeseman, [...] "everything I have ever drawn, every house, every man, every face has its roots in those few streets [...] All the things I have written, or hope to write, I am sure will have the same roots." ...|$|E
