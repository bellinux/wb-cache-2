5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century</b> vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E

5|$|The meat, blubber and fur {{coats of}} {{pinnipeds}} {{have traditionally been}} used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century,</b> while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total tuatara population had become extinct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} corn crake {{population had}} begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe {{is the loss of}} nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century</b> due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E

5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>century</b> due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers. Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Drained and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands.
