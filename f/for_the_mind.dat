5|$|Electric Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

25|$|This is {{primarily}} a book <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> {{in the sense that}} it requires deep thought and study, and does not appeal so directly to our emotional or devotional side as do Baba's short messages and exhortations to His followers. It is, in essence, a divine cosmology, a Map of the Evolving Universe, in which we all play a part, to help us find the quickest and shortest route home—to our Beloved God, Who Is found, on Realization, to be our very own Self.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience as an {{interdisciplinary}} field, and its branch of cognitive neuroscience particularly, operates under the ontological assumption of physicalism. In other words, it assumes—in order to perform its science—that only the fundamental phenomena studied by physics exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena {{within the framework}} according to which human thought and behavior are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of reductionism by seeking an explanation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> in terms of brain activity.|$|E

25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress. It can also {{reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|They land on Schar's World {{and search}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> in the Command System, {{a complex of}} {{subterranean}} train stations. They soon discover that the Mind is being hunted {{by a pair of}} Idiran soldiers who have killed all the Changers stationed on the planet, and who regard Horza and his crew as enemies, having no knowledge of the Changers' alliance with the Idirans. Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The CATs crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking the Mind to another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members of the Clear Air Turbulence are killed. Horza pursues Xoxarle and is fatally injured, but the Idiran is killed by Unaha-Closp and Balveda.|$|E
500|$|The band self-produced two EPs {{that drew}} {{attention}} on the underground circuit before signing to Vanguard Records in 1966. Their debut album, Electric Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> and Body, followed in 1967. It contained their only nationally charting single, [...] "Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine", and their most experimental arrangements. Their second album, I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die, was released in late 1967; its title track, with its dark humor and satire, became their signature tune and is among the era's most recognizable protest songs. Further success followed, including McDonald's appearance at Woodstock, but the group's lineup underwent changes until its disbandment in 1970. Members of the band continue {{in the music industry}} as solo recording artists and sporadically reconvene.|$|E

500|$|In early {{philosophies of}} {{psychology}} and metaphysics, conatus ( [...] ; Latin for [...] "effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself. This [...] "thing" [...] may be mind, matter {{or a combination of}} both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated. Seventeenth-century philosophers René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Thomas Hobbes made important contributions. [...] The conatus may refer to the instinctive [...] "will to live" [...] of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of motion and inertia. Often the concept is associated with God's will in a pantheist view of Nature. The concept may be broken up into separate definitions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and body and split when discussing centrifugal force and inertia.|$|E
500|$|She met Cage through Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary {{composition}} {{class at}} the New School for Social Research, and {{in the summer of}} 1960, she found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street and allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft with her, with people like Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending. Ono only presented work once during the series. In 1961, years before meeting Lennon, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat Carnegie Recital Hall (smaller than the [...] "Main Hall"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances. She had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted Cut Piece. She premiered The Fog Machine during her Concert of Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.|$|E
500|$|In February 1967, Country Joe and the Fish entered Sierra Sound Laboratories {{to record}} their debut album, Electric Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> and Body, with Charters and Denson {{overseeing}} the process. Prior to their studio work, Armstrong left the group and began a two-year alternative assignment as a conscientious objector, driving a truck for Goodwill Industries. Francis-Gunning {{was involved in the}} beginnings of the album's development but left {{when the rest of the}} band complained about his drumming technique. He was replaced by Gary [...] "Chicken" [...] Hirsh. The next recording session was postponed for three days as the most recognizable lineup of Country Joe and the Fish rehearsed with their new drummer at the Barn, in Santa Cruz. Hirsh's abilities were immediately distinguishable on the album, as he demonstrated an acute and articulate drum beat that music critic Bruce Eder praised as [...] "some of the best drumming on a psychedelic record this side of the late Spencer Dryden".|$|E

500|$|Electric Music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind</b> and Body was {{a success}} upon release, {{charting}} at number 39 on the Billboard 200, and {{remains one of the}} most enduring psychedelic works of the counterculture era. A single, [...] "Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine", was distributed a month prior to the release of the album and became the only Country Joe and the Fish single to chart, peaking at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100, in large part a culmination of its airplay on FM broadcasting and college stations. A reworked version of [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was intended to be released as a track on the album. However, Charters vetoed the decision to see whether the controversial song [...] "Superbird" [...] would face a radio ban. Nonetheless, the band was considered a forerunner in the emerging music scene in San Francisco, exhibiting one of the more polished debuts, just as its contemporaries were still refining their own sound. Melton attributes the album's success, particularly in San Francisco, to the band's appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967. Subsequently, the group toured the East Coast with an elaborate psychedelic light show.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} years, Pascu and The Blue Workers released two EPs, the {{rhythm and blues}} record Maşina cu jazzolină ("The Jazzolin Engine") and Caseta pentru minte, inimă şi gură ("The Cassette <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mind,</b> Heart and Mouth"). [...] Pascu also appeared {{on a number of}} comedy recordings released by Divertis, earning Pascu the reputation of a protest song writer. [...] He was inspired by Romanian politics and the social debates of the 1990s to write hits like [...] "Morcovul românesc" [...] ("The Romanian Carrot") and [...] "Instalatorul" [...] ("The Plumber"). [...] Pascu acknowledged his political streak, recognized what he considered the necessary link between social phenomena and a songwriter's cultural perspective, and argued that songs should always tell a story. One of the parody songs included on Maşina cu jazzolină, titled [...] "Africa, Africa", drew special interest in cultural circles with its satirical undertones. The lyrics suggested that modern Romania was no better than the average African nation. According to historian Sorin Mitu, [...] "Africa, Africa" [...] showed [...] "the Romanians' tendency to relate to extra-European realities", a trend he observed during Ceauşescu's final decade, and then throughout the early post-revolutionary period.|$|E
