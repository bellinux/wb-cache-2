2500|$|Sandy Creek, {{the stream}} that was dammed to create Lake Wilhelm, was noted in reports made by George Washington during his 1753 trip to Fort LeBoeuf during the French and Indian War. Sandy Creek had a {{recurring}} history of flooding. This {{led to a}} study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The study began in 1939. Plans were delayed by the start of World War II but the citizens of Mercer County could see the benefit of building a <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>dam</b> on Sandy Creek. The state, county, township and municipal authorities of the surrounding area worked together to push forward the idea of building the dam and recreational facilities in Mercer County. The land was acquired in the late 1960s. Construction on the dam began soon after and was completed in 1971. Maurice K. Goddard State Park was opened to the public in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|Lorentz {{was also}} {{asked by the}} Dutch {{government}} to chair a committee to calculate some {{of the effects of}} the proposed Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dam) <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>dam</b> on water levels in the Waddenzee. Hydraulic engineering was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem. Lorentz proposed to start from the basic hydrodynamic equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a [...] "human computer", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the Waddenzee. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.|$|E

Gwinnett County’s watershed <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>dams</b> provide valuable resources such as flood protection in downstream floodplains, protect roads and bridges, increase property values, provide recreational opportunities, provide fish and wildlife habitats, improve water quality, and protect public utility infrastructure. However, development downstream of the dams has resulted in twelve (12) of the fourteen (14) NRCS dams in the County to be classified as high hazard Category I Dams. Gwinnett County recognizes that the <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>dams</b> are {{a vital part of}} our Storm Water Management Program and have initiated a program to bring them into compliance with Georgia Safe Dams Program standards for Category I dams.
