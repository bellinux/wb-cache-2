5|$|Historically, {{there was}} a Native American village in the {{vicinity}} of Nescopeck Mountain, where the borough of Nescopeck is in modern times.

5|$|Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, Karl Boy-Ed, Franz von Papen, Dr. Heinrich Albert, and Franz von Rintelen, among others, were Germans {{investigated}} for producing propaganda. All were previously <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> the United States for {{being part of}} a German espionage ring. The United States Brewers Association, the National German-American Alliance, and the Hamburg-American steamship line were investigated. The final report concluded that these organizations, through financial support, bribes, boycotts, and coercion, sought to control the press, elections, and public opinion.|$|E
5|$|Though child-sized bikinis {{appeared}} in the 1950s, in many European countries, swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a top part, but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, {{it has often been}} considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7–11) to go topless. Several incidents of families being <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> public pools due to their child being topless have been reported. In 2002, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and underwear.|$|E

30|$|Cache {{replacement}} policies (i.e., {{decide on}} which item to <b>evict</b> <b>from</b> a cache {{when there is}} no available space) remain an important issue for the performance of a proxy cache. Traditional cache replacement algorithms use the historical information about content requests to decide which item to keep in the cache to maximize a certain performance metric (e.g., hit rate, the amount of saved bandwidth) [101]. Two of the most used replacement policies, even nowadays, are LFU (prioritize the most requested item) and LRU (prioritize the most recently requested item). One way to improve the efficiency of cache replacement algorithms is to actually integrate popularity prediction methods in the cache replacement decision. Famaey et al. propose P-LFU, an adaptation of LFU that determines which content to <b>evict</b> <b>from</b> the cache based on the predicted future demand [102]. Four generic functions (linear, power-law, exponential, and Gaussian) have been used to predict future content demand with the exponential distribution showing the most accurate results. Using a workload trace from a Video-on-Demand service the authors show that popularity prediction methods can increase the cache hit-rate with up to 10 % compared with LFU cache replacement strategy.|$|R
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1309, the Burgundian noble Walter of Brienne was {{selected}} as the Duke of Athens in Frankish Greece after the death of Guy II de la Roche. At that time the Greek world was in turmoil owing to the actions of the Catalan Company. These were a group of mercenaries, veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, originally hired by the Byzantine Empire against the Turks in Asia Minor. Soon, however, mutual suspicion and quarrels brought about an open conflict; <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> their base in Gallipoli in 1307, the Catalans marched west through Thrace and Macedonia, until, pressed by Byzantine troops under Chandrenos, they entered Thessaly in early 1309.|$|E
5|$|In week five, on Day 33, Big Brother punished Charlie for {{discussing}} nominations, {{telling him}} to remain silent {{for the rest of}} the day or else face the public vote. Later, Dogface and Kris were similarly punished, also for discussing nominations. All three failed to keep quiet and faced the public vote, along with Halfwit and Marcus, who received the most nominations. On Day 35, the housemates failed the circus-themed shopping task and received a basic shopping budget. On Day 37, Kris became the sixth person to be <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> the House with 63.0% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Ocean Village Marina was {{formerly}} Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina {{had been sold}} to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> their berths by the new owners. After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances {{seemed to have the}} effect of increasing Mingulay’s population as families <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E

5|$|The National Park Service {{was formed}} in 1916, and Yosemite was {{transferred}} to that agency's jurisdiction. Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 {{through the efforts of}} Ansel Franklin Hall.In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many of the Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> Yosemite in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Abu'l-Aswar {{is first}} {{recorded}} by the history of Matthew of Edessa in 1040, when the Armenian nobleman Abirat, who had become embroiled in the dispute between Gagik I's sons Ashot IV and Hovhannes-Smbat III, came to Dvin. Fearful of the latter's displeasure, Abirat with 12,000 horsemen sought Abu'l-Aswar's protection. Abu'l-Aswar initially welcomed Abirat {{and gave him a}} high position, but soon came to mistrust him, and had him killed, whereupon Abirat's lieutenant Sare departed for Ani with Abirat's supporters. Despite their kinship, {{at about the same time}} Abu'l-Aswar attacked David of Tashir. The Shaddadid army, numbering an impossible 150,000 according to Matthew of Edessa, captured much of Tashir, but David was able to assemble a broad alliance against Abu'l-Aswar. David himself fielded 10,000 troops, Hovhannes-Smbat III of Ani sent 3,000 men, the King of Kapan sent 2,000, and even the King of Georgia sent 4,000, while David also secured the public backing of the Catholicos of Albania. As a result, Abu'l-Aswar was defeated and <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> Tashir.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were <b>evicted</b> <b>from</b> their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
