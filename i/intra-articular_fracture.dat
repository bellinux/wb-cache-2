40|$|Objective To {{diagnose}} {{and evaluate}} soft tissue injuries in <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> of the distal radius using arthroscopy. Methods Twenty young patients with displaced <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> of distal radius were recruited in this prospective study. Three AO C 2 and 17 C 3 fractures were included. After arthroscopic examination fractures of distal radius were treated by external fixation with limited internal fixation or open plate fixation. Results Triangular fibrocartilage complex(TFCC) injury {{was found in}} 18 patients(90 %). Most were isolated Palmer type 1 D injuries(67 %). Scapho-lunate ligament injury wa s found in two patients:one partial tear(grade Ⅱ) and one complete tear(grad e Ⅲ). Follow-ups ranged from 6 to 18 months. At the last follow-up,wrist fun ction was excellent in one patient(6 %),good in eight(44 %) and fair in 11 (50 %).

50|$|In {{patients}} {{younger than}} 12, <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> of the elbow can {{be ruled out}} through sonography. Because <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> cause a joint effusion, the dorsal fat pad sign is a reliable parameter for diagnosis of elbow fractures. If a joint effusion is depicted in the ultrasound, two-plane X-ray imagery is necessary to diagnose the fracture. The standard procedure is the elbow-SAFE algorithm.The sensitivity of the method in comparison with X-ray imaging is 97.9 percent, the specificity is 95 percent, the positive predictive value is 0.95, and the negative predictive value is 0.98.|$|R

50|$|Displaced <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> require {{surgical}} intervention within 3 {{weeks of}} fracture, before bone consolidation has occurred. Conservative surgery consists of closed reduction with percutaneous fixation. This technique {{is associated with}} less wound complications, better soft tissue healing (because of less soft tissue manipulati) and decreased intraoperative time. However, this procedure has increased risk of inadequate calcaneal bone fixation, compared to open procedures. Currently, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) is usually the preferred surgical approach when dealing with displaced <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures.</b> Newer, more innovative surgical techniques and equipment have decreased the incidence of intra- and post-operative complications.|$|R
40|$|We have {{assessed}} the long-term results after operative and non-operative treatment of undisplaced and displaced calcaneal fractures. At {{a mean of}} 6. 5 years, we reviewed 70 patients with a calcaneal fracture who were divided into four groups: group 1, 18 patients with undisplaced fractures and a normal Böhler's angle (BA) who had been treated non-operatively; group 2, 23 with <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> and a BA 10 degrees who had been treated surgically; and group 4, 16 with <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fractures</b> and a BA 10 degrees had a satisfactory functional outcome and those with displaced fractures who had non-operative treatment had a poor outcome.

5000|$|On 4 July 2015, {{during a}} {{friendly}} {{game in the}} training period, has suffered an overwhelmingly <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> of the first toe of the right foot, that will cause him according to the officials' reports an absence of approximately 4 to 6 weeks. On 12 September 2015, {{he returned to the}} starting XI in the third day of the Greek Super League in an away 3-0 win against Veria, by scoring the first goal. Athanassiadis with this goal against Veria succeeded to score in his first game for the Greek Super league four years in a row. On 23 September 2015, with a penalty kick scored the winning goal in a home derby against the rivals AEK Athens. On 30 November 2015, a brace from Athanasiadis helped PAOK win 3-1 Kalloni at Mytilini, with Giannis Mystakidis also scoring at the last minute of the game. The home team had temporarily equalized with a penalty kick by captain Yiorghos Manousos. On 20 December 2015, with a penalty kick he gave PAOK a difficult 1-0 home win against brave Platanias, which created many chances to equalize.On 17 January 2015, Athanasiadis' goal against Veria on Greek Super League was the 100th official for the Greek striker in less than eight years after his first in April 2008. On 13 February 2016, according to medical staff Athanasiadis suffered a harmstring strain injury during Greek Cup match against Panionios and will remain out of action for 15-18 days. According to Super League statistics Stefanos Athanasiadis has been shown 49 yellow cards the last four years, an incredible number if we consider that he is playing mainly as striker. On 26 May 2016 he scored a brace in a 2-0 home win against Panionios for the play-offs exceeding 100 goals with the jersey of PAOK in all competitions. On 3 August 2016 he scored against Ajax for the Uefa Champions League 3rd qualifying round. His team lost 1-2 and got knocked out of the competition. On 29 September 2016, Klaus netted both goals as PAOK recover from nightmare start in a UEFA Group stage against FC Slovan Liberec when Russian Nikolay Komlichenko scores opening goal in 41 seconds in a 2-1 PAOK away win. He finished the 2016-17 season without being able to score with the club in the Super League, that had to happen since 1978 with the striker Georgios Kostikos. [...] He started the 2017-18 season as a late substitute in a 3-1 home win game against Östersunds FK at Toumba Stadium for the 1st leg of UEFA Europa League play-offs.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There is {{controversy}} over the outcomes and complications of volar and dorsal plating {{for the treatment of}} <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> distal radius. Methods: From 2008 to 2010, 81 patients with <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> distal radius of AO type C 1 –C 3 treated with distal radius locking plates via volar or dorsal approaches were reviewed in our institute. The clinical, radiological, and functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months after operation. Results: The volar approach group showed a significantly better flexion range, flexion-extension arc as well as Green and O'Brien functional score than dorsal approach group. Volar tilting of the distal radius was significantly better in the dorsal group, but that did not contribute to better palmar–flexion range or grip strength. Overall complication rate was similar in both groups. Conclusion: The volar approach group demonstrated better range of motion and functional score. The complication rates were similar between the two groups. The volar surgical approach should be adopted in most operative cases of AO type C <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> distal radius while the dorsal approach should be reserved for <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> with dorsal comminuted fragments...|$|E

40|$|Background. The outcome after {{displaced}} <b>intra-articular</b> calcaneal <b>fractures</b> {{is influenced}} by the condition of the surrounding soft tissues. To avoid secondary soft tissue complications after surgical treatment, several less-invasive procedures for reduction and fixation have been introduced.

40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} a single well-reduced or stable <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> {{oriented}} in the sagittal plane {{on the outcome of}} internal fixation of a distal radial fracture is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that wrist motion and function scores would not differ between patients with an extra-articular fracture and those with a single sagittal <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> following open fracture reduction and internal fixation with use of a volar locking plate. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with a single sagittal <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal aspect of the radius and seventyfour age and sex-matched patients with an extra-articular distal radial fracture were retrospectively analyzed with use of data gathered in a cohort study of plate and screw fixation of distal radial fractures. A volar locking plate was used in all patients. The two cohorts were analyzed for differences in motion, grip strength, pain, and Gartland and Werley, DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand), and SF- 36 (Short Form- 36) scores six, twelve, and twenty-four months after surgery. Differences between the cohorts and differences within each cohort over time were determined with use of regression analysis and the likelihood ratio test. Results: Patients with a single sagittal <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture</b> and those an extra-articular fracture did not differ significantly with respect to motion, grip strength, Gartland and Werley score, or DASH score at any time point. However, there was a trend toward less pronation (95 % compared with 98 % of that in the contralateral arm) and less grip strength (76 % compared with 81 % of that in the contralateral arm) at six months and toward a smaller flexion-extension arc (118 °compared with 128 °) at one year after surgery in patients with a single sagittal <b>intra-articular</b> <b>fracture.</b> Conclusions: Open reduction and volar locking plate and screw fixation of extra-articular fractures and of simple intra-articular fractures of the distal aspect of the radius are associated with comparable impairment and disability within two years of surgery.
