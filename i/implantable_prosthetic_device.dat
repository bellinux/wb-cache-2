40|$|Stimulus {{artifacts}} inhibit reliable {{acquisition of}} biological evoked potentials for several milliseconds if an electrode contact is utilized for both electrical stimulation and recording purposes. This hinders {{the measurement of}} evoked short-latency biological responses, which is otherwise elicited by stimulation in <b>implantable</b> <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> We present an improved stimulus artifact suppression scheme using two electrode simultaneous stimulation and differential readout using high-gain amplifiers. Substantial reduction of artifact duration has been shown possible through the common-mode rejection property of an instrumentation amplifier for electrode interfaces. The performance of this method depends on good matching of electrode-electrolyte interface properties of the chosen electrode pair. A novel calibration algorithm has been developed that helps in artificial matching of impedance and thereby achieves the required performance in artifact suppression. Stimulus artifact duration has been reduced down to 50 mu s from the stimulation-cum-recording electrodes, {{which is similar to}} 6 x improvement over the present state of the art. The system is characterized with emulated resistor-capacitor loads and a variety of in-vitro metal electrodes dipped in saline environment. The proposed method is going to be useful for closed-loop electrical stimulation and recording studies, such as bidirectional neural prosthesis of retina, cochlea, brain, and spinal cord...|$|R

The basal ganglia are responsible for regulating motor control of the human body, a function exemplified by disease states such as PD. We describe a novel technique based on a chronically <b>implantable</b> neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device</b> {{that could be used}} as a potential treatment in many basal ganglia disorders, including PD. The <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device</b> implements a fuzzy control of the baseline excitation of the motor cortex and derives a feedback loop from the thalamocortical pathway, thus forming a closed loop control.

40|$|The {{next-generation}} <b>implantable</b> high-power <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices,</b> such as retinal prostheses, will be {{powered by}} inductively coupled coils of high efficiency. However, {{the use of}} high-frequency power carriers almost always induces significant AC resistance due to skin and proximity effects, which limits the overall coupling efficiency. Inspired by the widely used round Litz wire, planar coils with planar Litz structures were investigated on the printed circuit board (PCB) and showed the reduced AC resistances in some specific frequency ranges. Herein, various planar Litz structures were introduced into previous MEMS foil coils, which have been proved to be superior over the conventional planar counterparts. The experimental results provided by the aforementioned prototypes showed a reduction of AC resistance up to 13. 3 % compared to a solid foil coil. A microfabrication process, which combines a single layer metal deposition and patterning with a post folding step, was developed to construct the planar Litz structure...|$|R
40|$|Stroke, {{spinal cord}} injury and {{neurodegenerative}} diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's debilitate their victims by suffocating, cleaving communication between, and/or poisoning entire populations of geographically correlated neurons. Although the damage associated with such injury or disease is typically irreversible, recent advances in <b>implantable</b> neural <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> offer hope {{for the restoration of}} lost sensory, cognitive and motor functions by remapping those functions onto healthy cortical regions. The research presented in this thesis is directed toward developing enabling technology for totally implantable neural prosthetics that could one day restore lost sensory, cognitive and motor function to the victims of debilitating neural injury or disease. 	 There are three principal components to this work. First, novel integrated biosensors have been designed and implemented to transduce weak extra-cellular electrical potentials and optical signals from cells cultured directly {{on the surface of the}} sensor chips, as well as to manipulate cells on the surface of these chips. Second, a method of detecting and identifying stereotyped neural signals, or action potentials, has been mapped into silicon circuits which operate at very low power levels suitable for implantation. Third, as one small step towards the development of cognitive neural implants, a learning silicon synapse has been implemented and a neural network application demonstrated. The original contributions of this dissertation include: *	A contact image sensor that adapts to background light intensity and can asynchronously detect statistically significant optical events in real-time; *	Programmable electrode arrays for enhanced electrophysiological recording, for directing cellular growth, for site-specific in situ bio-functionalization, and for analyte and particulate collection; *	Ultra-low power, programmable floating gate template matching circuits for the detection and classification of neural action potentials; *	A two transistor synapse that exhibits spike timing dependent plasticity and can implement adaptive pattern classification and silicon learning...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND SIGINIFICANCE: Few options {{exist for}} {{companion}} animals {{in need of}} <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> With the rise of rapid prototyping technology, the availability and customization of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> for individual companion animals is now a viable and cost effective alternative to the current options of a peg leg prosthetic, or wheel-assisted <b>prosthetic</b> <b>device.</b> The goals {{of this study were}} to describe the (1) specific needs and (2) biomechanics of a feline with bilateral thoracic limb amputation, (3) develop custom <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> utilizing rapid prototyping technology, and (4) describe the biomechanics of a feline with bilateral thoracic limb amputation using the custom <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> The feline being studied in this project is a 2 year old Maine Coon feline weighing 9 lbs. She was a stray that was found with severe frostbite on her thoracic limbs. These sections of her thoracic limbs were amputated to remove the necrotic tissue. SPECIFIC AIMS: The goals {{of this study is to}} describe the (1) specific needs and (2) biomechanics of feline with bilateral thoracic limb amputation, (3) develop custom <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> utilizing rapid prototyping technology, and (4) describe the biomechanics of a feline with bilateral thoracic limb amputation with the use of the custom <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> MATERIALS 2 ̆ 6 METHODS: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology was utilized to fabricate the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> that were designed and put through a Finite Element Analysis to simulate static loading and fatigue testing during various stages of the gait cycle. The devices were mechanically tested to ensure device failure did not occur during static loading, as well as fatigue tested to resemble continued use. vii Kinematic gait analysis was performed prior to and after use of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices,</b> and outcomes were compared between the scenarios. Gait data was also compared to published feline gait data to determine any effects to the feline’s gait resulting from the amputation, and if this effect was corrected through the use of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices.</b> RESULTS: FDM was a cost effective way to fabricate strong, durable <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> designed specifically for a companion animal with dual thoracic limb amputation. Mechanical testing ensured that the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> can survive over 10, 000 loading cycles at 6 N, and 3000 N of vertical force. The gait analysis performed without the use of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> show increased flexion of the elbows, stifle, and tarsus joint during ambulation. Gait analysis during the use of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> removes this additional flexion. CONCLUSION: Use of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> can have a positive influence in the gait of companion animals with amputations. The comparison between the two data sets shows removal of the additional flexion found in the thoracic limbs when the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> are used. This project showcases the feasibility of using additive manufacturing to create cost effect and durable <b>prosthetic</b> <b>devices</b> for use in companion animals...|$|R
