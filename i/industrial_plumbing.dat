40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from June 14, 2011 - June 14, 2016 Something Mortal I Could Fall Upon {{is a collection of}} poetry exploring geographical, emotional, and cerebral permutations of home. These poems ask: What is home? What does it mean to give up a place? How does, or can, one rebuild the home? Although it is clear the speaker loves the landscape of her childhood and feels loyalty to her family, the poems quickly problematize home as the speaker reveals memories of family members' addiction, recounts abandonment, and describes feeling separate or outcast from the family. Throughout the manuscript, emotional wars play out between devotion to the family/landscape and disgust of the unpleasant realities of home. Trying to reconcile conflicting feelings, the speaker looks to the natural world and to society/the <b>industrial,</b> <b>plumbs</b> years of memories, and peers into the lives of historical, yet similarly distraught figures. The only definitive acts become the process of seeking answers and the understanding that though home may be imperfect, it is still undeniably longed for and ultimately inescapable...|$|R

The type of system shall be determined {{on the basis of}} location, soil porosity, and groundwater level, and shall be designed to receive all sewage from the property. The system, except as otherwise approved, shall consist of a septic tank with effluent discharging into a subsurface disposal field, into one (1) or more seepage pits, or into a combination of subsurface disposal field and seepage pits. The Authority Having Jurisdiction may grant exceptions to the provisions of this appendix for permitted structures that have been destroyed due to fire or natural disaster and that cannot be reconstructed in compliance with these provisions provided that such exceptions are the minimum necessary. (B) Where the quantity or quality of the sewage is such that the above system cannot be expected to function satisfactorily for commercial, agricultural, and <b>industrial</b> <b>plumbing</b> systems; for installations where appreciable amounts of industrial or indigestible wastes are produced; for occupancies producing abnormal quantities of sewage or liquid waste; or when grease interceptors are required by other parts of this code, the method of sewage treatment an...|$|E
40|$|From the {{economic}} reasons many products originally made from austenite stainless steel are nowadays made from ferritic stainless steel. Ferritic steels have relatively {{low yield strength}} and the work hardening is limited. They cannot be hardened by heat treatment and only moderately hardened by cold working. Commercially made stainless steel tubes from ferritic steel, used for <b>industrial</b> <b>plumbing</b> was examined on presence of cracks. The cracking was present {{on the inner side}} of the convoluted tube shape. The tube manufacturing process consisted of continual bending of the sheet to tube shape, weld the tube, then of cold shaping by pulling through rib-forming frames, which is done in several steps. Then thermal treatment applies to the nearly finished product to remove stress remaining in the structure. Prime suspect was deformation beyond the ductility of used material. However the stress-strain tensile testing does not approved this hypothesis. Several samples of failed material were taken together with reference, and were examined by optical microscopy, and X-Ray Diffraction structure analysis. The structure of the cracked tubes does not show the signs of deformation over the limit, except the location near to the crack itself. Interestingly enough the failed material showed more homogenous structure than the original one. Needle like structures were found when the material is “overetched”, on these structures concentration of stress under bending occur. This structure was identified as δ-ferrite, however its presence in α-ferrite matrix is unclear...|$|E
