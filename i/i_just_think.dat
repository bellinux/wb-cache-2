And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E
500|$|The Commitments is {{the first}} book in Doyle's series known as The Barrytown Trilogy, {{followed}} by The Snapper (1990) and The Van (1991). While all three novels focus on the Rabbitte family, Doyle expressed {{that he was not}} interested in writing or producing sequels to the 1991 film adaptation, stating, [...] "I hope it's never made. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that, whereas The Commitments was very much a labour of love, Commitments 2 is definitely an act of cynicism." ...|$|E

500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how Shoelace is. I think Shoelace is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast still. I think Shoelace might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E
500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you.

[...] At Henderson's insistence, the {{giveaway}} plastic dolls had one atypical modification: [...] "I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [...] like I'm playing the game." [...] Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: [...] "Sometimes when I sit around {{and look at the}} game and things ain't going right, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think,</b> 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think,</b> fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like."

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record. I {{have a lot of respect}} for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's lazy journalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Levine has stated: [...] "verything that's {{written and}} {{performed}} {{and put together}} pretty much comes from us. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> people would be surprised to know that we’re a self-contained unit.

[...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, [...] "It's almost as if [...] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best." ...|$|E

500|$|The spacewalk was {{completed}} in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS passed the initial aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble servicing spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. During the previous day's mission status briefing, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made a prediction, joking that since the first two spacewalks, which {{were considered to be}} straightforward, had run into issues, the most difficult EVA – to repair the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. [...] "I have a prediction, We've always said EVA 3 {{was going to be the}} most difficult and the most challenging, and I predict it's going to go more smoothly than any other EVA on this mission. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that's some version of Murphy's Law that's going to lead us in that direction." ...|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|Mauboy's weight {{has been}} the subject of media interest, ever since her rise to fame on Australian Idol when judge Kyle Sandilands {{publicly}} told her to [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy told Women's Health magazine that she was proud of her curvy figure, saying [...] "having curves is one of my favourite things". In 2014, she received media attention for her weight loss transformation from a size 12 to 8. Mauboy has an alter ego named J Malley, who she described as her [...] "fearless side" [...] and [...] "sort of like Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce". Mauboy is often referred to as Australia's answer to Beyoncé. However, she does not agree with the comparisons, saying [...] "I totally disagree with that one. I've...watched her documentary [...] and was just blown away by how magnificent she really is and it's so inspiring for me. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> she's fantastic and I'm completely nowhere near where she is, but I aspire to that." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When you hear The Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But we ended up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{majoring in}} finance, Youkilis excelled {{as a player}} for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. [...] "I take no credit", said Cleary. [...] "He coaches himself.

He made the adjustments he had to make. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> he's a really smart guy who had a great feel {{for what he had}} to do." [...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. [...] I think the body did scare some people away." ...|$|E

However, {{it would have to be}} pushed back to 2013. Pusha T described the tape as street-oriented music intended for his longtime fans. [...] "Wrath of Caine is basically just me catering to my core. It's all about just street Hip Hop, street music" [...] he said. [...] "It's just something that I like to do. It's something that I feel like has no boundaries, no parameters. I can do what I really, really want to do… not about more of a creative , <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's about more of what I want to hear for myself and what my fans want to hear.

2500|$|Meath's captain Nigel Crawford {{gave his}} {{opinion on the}} incident: [...] "I'm sure most players have been {{involved}} in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> it's possible or <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> it can happen. If you start that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|R
5000|$|Throughout these years, Sheila Martin {{apparently}} had little aspirations {{in regards to}} her husband's office. Her husband's biographer John Gray quoted her as saying, [...] "Oh, God, I don't {{want to do this}} at all, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|R

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
