40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is remote {{interpreting}} (RI). Our objective has been to describe the current experience with this new kind of interpreting, the reasons for its application, {{the opinions of the}} interpreters and the impact of RI on their work and health. The paper is divided in two sections. In the theoretical part, we explained the term remote interpreting and its two meanings: (<b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> in general x simultaneous conference interpreting without direct view at the speaker). A short description of the various types of <b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> (telephone interpreting, interpreting for deafs and in media) and the modern ways of conferencing make a panorama of situations in which the <b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> is (or could be) used...|$|E
40|$|This volume largely {{grows out}} of an {{international}} symposium, organized {{as part of the}} Meerts Chair for Specialized Communication, appointed to Franz Pöchhacker in 2016. The participants were very positive about the outcomes of the conference and expressed the will to share this knowledge in a publication. A selection of papers presented at this symposium, in combination with chapters by some invited experts in the field, will present a state of the art on digital video technology, firstly as used in various ways of <b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> in different domains (practice) and secondly as used in research to develop (re) new(ing) approaches and methodology. The development and widespread availability of digital technologies for capturing and transmitting visual images has revolutionized the production and consumption of media content and profoundly affected the processing of audiovisual material in all walks of life, interpreting being no exception. Whereas interpreters, for most of history, have had to be on site (working hic et nunc) so as to have access to the multimodal reality of communicative interaction, they can now gain real-time access to images from communication venues in remote locations and render their services ‘off-site’ via videoconference links. The potential and limitations of such video remote interpreting in different modes, modalities and settings are still poorly understood, and this volume will provide opportunities for stocktaking. It will do so from several perspectives. In a first theoretical part, an overview of medium and modality in Interpreting Studies will be given, as well as a taxonomic model of <b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> terminology. In a second part, a series of chapters focuses on professional practices across various domains, including European institutions, legal settings and healthcare interpreting and is concluded by a contribution {{on the role of the}} interpreter in different remote interpreting interactions in light of the role-space model (Llewellyn-Jones & Lee 2014). The third part of the volume zooms in on new ways in which digital video technology has been harnessed in research on interpreting, including both conceptual approaches (such as gaze and gesture analysis) and methodology such as the introduction of a methodological framework to assess the quality of remote interpreting in dialogic healthcare settings, the use of video in signed language interpreting as well as eye tracking and multimodal transcription. While the practice of video conference-based interpreting and new image-based research techniques may often have little, if any, direct interface, this book aims to foreground the links between the two, so that researchers can gain better access to authentic video material, and the new realities of remote interpreting can in turn receive the scholarly attention it requires and deserves. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to teach interpreting by distance mode using technologies such as teleconferencing, videoconferencing and Internet. Most of these attempts have faced a common constraint ? the teacher and students cannot engage in live visual interaction as if they were in a physical language lab, and the effect of teaching is therefore compromised. As a result, most <b>distance</b> <b>interpreting</b> instruction is limited to the provision of interpreting materials for students to practise by themselves, and hence become a form of self study for students. This paper presents an experiment which tries to make use of the state-of-the-art synchronous cyber classroom to create a teaching and learning space that is comparable to face-to-face teaching, allowing the teacher to teach interpreting per se and students to practise interpreting in groups, pairs or individually under the teacher?s supervision. The key characteristic of this experiment is that the teacher and students can hear and see each other in teaching and learning as well as in practice. The findings of the experiment suggest that in spite of certain constraints inherent in computer technology, the important aspect of verbal and visual interaction in teaching interpreting per se can be accommodated using the technology of synchronous cyber classrooms...|$|E

40|$|In {{arguing that}} borders {{not only should}} be {{understood}} as economic barriers to trade, but also as cultural barriers to interaction, this paper attempts to operationalize a broader interpretation of borders with regards to economic cross-cultural integration. Formalizing the cultural effects of borders as mental <b>distances</b> (<b>interpreted</b> as social identities), and using an agent-based simulation model, I analyze how the border affects, and is affected by, economic integration. The model is based on two regions separated by a border. Based on expected payoffs and mental distance, agents first choose whether to interact at home or to cross the border. Then, agents choose their action in a simple PD game based on a general disposition of trust, {{as well as the}} mental distance should the interaction partner be from across the border. The agent’s mental distance and trust level are then updated according to the agent’s experience of the interaction. The model reveals that underlying cultural processes may affect the success of economic integration and suggests that the integrational success furthermore depends in asymmetric ways on mental distances between regions, on economically vs. culturally motivated behavior, and on collectivistic vs. individualistic characters of the regional cultures...|$|R

Analyzing 8031 syndicated loans to US borrowers signed between 1986 and 2007, we find that lending shares are higher for foreign arrangers than domestic arrangers. Among foreign arrangers, lending shares further increase with cultural <b>distance.</b> We <b>interpret</b> this {{as a result of an}} increased moral hazard problem driven by higher information and effort costs faced by foreign arrangers.

40|$|Interpreting is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} particularly demanding language processing task for the cognitive system. Dependency distance, the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is an index of sentence complexity and is also able to reflect the cognitive constraints during various tasks. In the current research, we examine the difference in dependency <b>distance</b> among three <b>interpreting</b> types, namely, simultaneous interpreting, consecutive interpreting and read-out translated speech based on a treebank comprising these types of interpreting output texts with dependency annotation. Results show that different interpreting renditions yield different dependency <b>distances,</b> and consecutive <b>interpreting</b> texts entail the smallest dependency distance other than those of simultaneous interpreting and read-out translated speech, suggesting that consecutive interpreting bears heavier cognitive demands than simultaneous interpreting. The current research suggests {{for the first time}} that interpreting is an extremely demanding cognitive task that can further mediate the dependency distance of output sentences. Such findings may be due to the minimization of dependency distance under cognitive constraints...|$|R

In particular, the paper documents a remarkably robust link between genetic distance and health as measured by life expectancy at birth and the adult survival rate. Also, the evidence reveals that the link has strengthened considerably over the 20 th century which highlights the increasing effects of globalization on health conditions across countries through the transmission of health technologies.

40|$|We {{explore the}} idea of {{asymptotic}} silence in causal set theory and find that causal sets approximated by continuum spacetimes exhibit behaviour akin to asymptotic silence. We make use of an intrinsic definition of spatial distance between causal set elements in the discrete analogue of a spatial hypersurface. Using numerical simulations for causal sets approximated by D= 2, 3 and 4 dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show that while the discrete distance rapidly converges to the continuum distance at a scale roughly {{an order of magnitude}} larger than the discreteness scale, it is significantly larger on small scales. This allows us to define an effective dimension which exhibits dimensional reduction in the ultraviolet, while monotonically increasing to the continuum dimension with increasing continuum <b>distance.</b> We <b>interpret</b> these findings as manifestations of asymptotic silence in causal set theory.

We then compared climate niche overlap of pairs of species, {{selected on the basis of}} phylogenetic information. In contrast to expectations, related species were not similar in their climate niche. Rather, even species pairs that had a common ancestor less than 1 Ma already display very high climate niche <b>distances.</b> We <b>interpret</b> our finding as a strong interspecific competitive constraint on the realized niche, rather than a rapid evolution of the fundamental niche. If correct, our results imply a very limited usefulness of climate niche models for the prediction of future mammal distributions...|$|R

40|$|A {{dependence}} of the rate of occurrence and properties of interplanetary discontinuities on radial distance were investigated using Pioneer 10 and 11 vector helium magnetometer observations. Spatial and temporal variations were separated and discontinuities identified, noting that their rate of occurrence undergoes large variations well outside the deviations expected from statistical fluctuations. Temporal changes in the occurrence rate averaged over Bartels solar rotations were well correlated at Pioneer 10 and 11, separated by a distance of 2 AU, and time variations consisted of slow modulation of the occurrence rate due to changing solar conditions. The correlation over widely separated <b>distances</b> is <b>interpreted</b> by a model in which the discontinuities originate inside 1 AU and are convected outward by the solar wind.

40|$|The use of {{hydrophobic}} surfaces {{is important}} for many processes both in nature and industry. Interactions between hydrophobic species {{play a key role}} in industrial applications such as water-cleaning procedures and pitch control during papermaking but they also give information on how to design surfaces like hydrophobic mineral pigments. In this thesis, the influence of surface properties on wetting and interaction forces has been studied. Surfaces with close-packed particles, pore arrays, randomly deposited nanoparticles as well as reference surfaces were prepared. The atomic force microscope (AFM) was utilized for force and friction measurements while contact angles and confocal Raman microscopy experiments were mainly used for wetting studies. The deposition of silica particles in the size range of nano- to micrometers using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique resulted in particle coated surfaces exhibiting hexagonal close-packing and close to Wenzel state wetting after hydrophobization. Force measurements displayed long-range interaction forces assigned to be a consequence of air cavitation. Smaller roughness features provided larger forces and interaction <b>distances</b> <b>interpreted</b> as being due to fewer restrictions of capillary growth. Friction measurements proved both the surface structure and chemistry to be important for the observed forces. On hydrophobic pore array surfaces, the three-phase contact line of water droplets avoided the pores which created a jagged interface. The influence of the pores was evident in the force curves, both in terms of the shape, in which the three-phase contact line movements around the pores could be detected, as well as the depth of the pores providing different access and amount of air. When water/ethanol mixtures were used, the interactions were concluded to be due to ethanol condensation. Confocal Raman microscopy experiments with water and water/ethanol mixtures on superhydrophobic surfaces gave evidence for water depletion and ethanol/air accumulation close to the surface. Force measurements using superhydrophobic surfaces showed extremely long-range interaction distances. This work has provided evidence for air cavitation between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solution. It was also shown that the range and magnitude of interaction forces could, to some extent, be predicted by looking at certain surface features like structure,roughness and the overall length scales.

Calculations are carried out on the best available ground 12 A' global adiabatic potential energy surface of Deskevich et. al. [1]. Converged state-to-state wave packet reaction cross sections with the DCl (v= 0, j= 0 - 1; v= 1, j= 0) reagent have been calculated for the collision energy range from threshold up to 0. 5 eV. Accurate product vibrational and rotational distributions of cross sections have been calculated at selected collision energies. State-to-state and total initial-state resolved rate constants of the title reaction have been calculated in a temperature range of 100 - 300 K. The present accurate calculations at v= 0, j= 0, J= 0 show noticeable differences with previous calculations for the F+HCl reaction.
