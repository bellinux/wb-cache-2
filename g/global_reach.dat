5|$|In January 1992 Walsh {{was made}} chief {{executive}} of Pillsbury, {{in addition to his}} job as CFO of the Grand Met food division. He identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and reined in their independence to make them more accountable to head office. He also invested heavily in research and development, technology, IT systems and marketing. A boosted marketing budget helped to grow Häagen-Dazs from a well known US brand to a product with <b>global</b> <b>reach,</b> {{and one of the best}} known names in luxury ice cream.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire was {{the largest}} on Earth, and Britain {{protected}} that empire and its trade routes with the world's largest navy. Great Britain {{assumed the role of}} peacekeeper on the world's oceans, and the Royal Navy was the instrument by which the Pax Britannica was kept. The <b>global</b> <b>reach</b> of the Royal Navy included the western Pacific Ocean, patrolled by the Australia Station. In 1887 Captain Henry Coey Kane took Calliope to the Pacific. At first assigned to the China Station, the vessel was reassigned to the Australia Station later in 1887. The cruiser was in New Zealand {{at the end of that}} year, and was the first vessel to enter the new Calliope Dock. In early 1888 Calliope was sent north to watch over a looming diplomatic crisis and potential military confrontation in Samoa.|$|E

40|$|After {{two decades}} since the {{disintegration}} of Soviet Union in 1991, the largest and the most populist socialist state — the People's Republic of China — does not only manage to stay intact, but has also emerged as the second largest economy in the world. Moreover, its political, diplomatic, military and cultural reaches have been extended to {{various parts of the}} world. There have been many factual and fictional discussions and debates in the public domains, on China's apparent rise either as a threat or an opportunity. This book will take on these discussions and debates to provide theory-informed empirical studies regarding a few research questions: How does the People's Republic of China manage to rise and achieve <b>global</b> <b>reaches?</b> How can we effectively conceptualize China's <b>global</b> <b>reaches?</b> What internal and external strategic and security measures have Chinese state adopted in order to maintain such vast and far-reaching constellations of domestic-external nexuses? We consider that the idea and concept of “Global China” is perhaps the most viable analytical instrument to capture such increasingly complex phenomena in association with the rise of China...|$|R
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped {{thermonuclear}} weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop {{around the perimeter of}} North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's <b>global</b> <b>reach,</b> from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a <b>global</b> <b>reach</b> of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} {{has given rise}} to dozens of Hindu saints with {{international}} influence. For example, Brahma Baba established the Brahma Kumaris, one of the largest new Hindu religious movements which teaches the discipline of Raja Yoga to millions. Representing traditional Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Prabhupada founded the Hare Krishna movement, another organisation with a <b>global</b> <b>reach.</b> In late 18th-century India, Swaminarayan founded the Swaminarayan Sampraday. Anandamurti, founder of the Ananda Marga, has also influenced many worldwide. Through the international influence of all of these new Hindu denominations, many Hindu practices such as yoga, meditation, mantra, divination, and vegetarianism have been adopted by new converts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a 3 D elastic {{model for the}} {{segmentation}} of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been proposed and analyzed. Elastic models for segmentation usually involve minimization of internal and external energy. A problem we observed with standard internal and external energy is that the local or the <b>global</b> <b>reached</b> minima do not impose the external energy to be zero. To eliminate this difficulty, we propose introducing a constraint. The constraint problem is proved to be mathematically well posed, and a simple algorithm which avoids computing the Lagrange multiplier is provided. This algorithm is proved to be convergent. Finally {{the efficiency of the}} method is shown with numerical experiments. 1...|$|R

The technology utilized by Trans uses the nearly unlimited quantum bandwidth by which subatomic particles communicate with each other, and when users of Trans begin to see ghosts, Peter gradually discovers that Trans has tapped into a channel where human memories are stored and survive the death of the body. Unfortunately, Trans has made a noise and awakened nameless things much older than human beings, who feed on souls and memories.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of CEO Walter B. Wriston, First National City Bank (and its holding company First National City Corporation) was renamed as Citibank, N.A. (and Citicorp, respectively). Shortly afterward, the bank launched the Citicard, which pioneered the use of 24-hour ATMs. John S. Reed was elected CEO in 1984, and Citi became {{a founding member of the}} CHAPS clearing house in London. Under his leadership, the next 14 years would see Citibank become the largest bank in the United States and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world, and expand its <b>global</b> <b>reach</b> to over 90 countries.|$|E
25|$|The Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory {{was founded}} by Paul Rabinow, Stephen Collier, and Andrew Lakoff {{as part of an}} effort to create new forms of inquiry in the human sciences. Its {{aspiration}} is to create models for new infrastructures, tools of collaboration, and practices of inquiry. The core of the ARC collaboratory is ongoing reflection and communication in a now broadening network of scholars about concept formation and collaboratory work in the human sciences. ARC is a collaboratory for inquiry into contemporary forms of life, labor, and language. ARC engages in empirical study and conceptual work with <b>global</b> <b>reach</b> and long-term perspective. ARC creates contemporary equipment for collaborative work adequate to emergent challenges in the 21st century. ARC’s current concerns focus on interconnections among security, ethics, and the sciences.|$|E

25|$|A year later, in 1944, William T. R. Fox, an American {{foreign policy}} professor, {{elaborated}} {{on the concept}} in the book The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace, which spoke of the <b>global</b> <b>reach</b> of a super-empowered nation. Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status {{in a world in}} which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Empire was the most extensive empire in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} is currently led by its sixth president, Dr. Judy Genshaft, who {{took office in}} July 2000. She also serves {{as the president of}} the USF System. Under Genshaft's leadership, the university has emerged as a top research university and major economic engine with an annual economic impact of $3.7 billion. The university has expanded its <b>global</b> <b>reach,</b> with the opening of the first Confucius Institute in Florida in 2008 and the creation of the Genshaft/Greenbaum Passport Scholarship Fund in 2011, which provides financial support to USF students who want to study abroad. Under Genshaft, USF has continuously been ranked among the top veteran friendly universities in the country. In 2009, USF became the first university in the nation to partner with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to offer specialized services for veterans taking advantage of the new G.I. Bill. USF continues to improve academically, being ranked among the best colleges in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. In 2012, USF was recognized as one of the nation's largest producers of Fulbright Program scholars.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Ferrari and Schumacher {{returned}} to almost total {{dominance of the}} championships, winning both with ease - in the first thirteen races of the season, Schumacher managed to win twelve. A new race in Bahrain made its debut in April and another new race in China debuted in September. It was initially thought that in introducing these new races, older Grands Prix in Europe, like the British Grand Prix, might {{be removed from the}} championship, but instead the number of races was increased to eighteen. According to Ecclestone, the move was to increase Formula One's <b>global</b> <b>reach,</b> though the steady tightening of restrictions on tobacco advertising in Europe and elsewhere may also have been a factor. This move saw the percentage of races held outside Formula One's traditional European home climb to around fifty percent – meaning the World Championship, which visits four of the six continents, truly deserves its name. 2004 was Michael Schumacher's most recent of his record seven World Championships. Schumacher also holds the record for the most races won – with ninety-one.|$|E
