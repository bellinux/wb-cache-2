5|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive (VFD; also termed adjustable-frequency drive, variable speed drive, AC drive, micro <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> inverter drive) {{is a type}} of adjustable-speed drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the patient to a hospital, though in rugged areas four-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> all-terrain vehicles can be used. Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Denver {{used to be}} a major trading {{center for}} beef and {{livestock}} when ranchers would <b>drive</b> (<b>or</b> later transport) cattle to the Denver Union Stockyards for sale. As a celebration of that history, {{for more than a century}} Denver has hosted the annual National Western Stock Show, attracting as many as 10,000 animals and 700,000 attendees. The show is held every January at the National Western Complex northeast of downtown.|$|E

5|$|The $150 million, pedestrian-only Mamilla {{shopping}} mall has been {{touted as a}} luxury destination {{in the style of}} Los Angeles' Rodeo <b>Drive</b> <b>or</b> The Grove. Its commercial space is leased at $40 to $80 per square metre to 140 businesses, including international names like Rolex, MAC, H. Stern, Nike, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica, bebe, and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as local chains like Castro, Ronen Chen, Steimatzky Books, and Cafe Rimon. The mall is also slated to house an IMAX theatre. The first Gap store in Israel opened in Mamilla Mall in August 2009.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{includes}} {{a number of}} major buildings. While the Secretariat building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters, it also includes the domed General Assembly building, the Dag Hammarskjöld Library, as well as the Conference and Visitors Center, which is situated between the General Assembly and Secretariat buildings, and can be seen only from FDR <b>Drive</b> <b>or</b> the East River. Just inside the perimeter fence of the complex stands a line of flagpoles where the flags of all 193 UN member states, plus the UN flag, are flown in English alphabetical order.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley is open year-round and {{numerous}} activities {{are available through}} the National Park Service, Yosemite Conservancy, and Delaware North at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves. Others like to <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows (May–October) {{and go for a}} walk or hike.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case {{is a waste of time}} and they should return to Washington.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to <b>drive</b> <b>or</b> only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
