There {{are various}} fabric {{redesign}} forms of traditional Chinese costume; {{they are born}} with Chinese traditional clothing culture, they reflect the social political hierarchy, ethnic cultural characteristics and contain auspicious wishes and symbolic implication. Fabric redesign forms of traditional Chinese costume Fabric reconstruction design is the redesign way of changing {{the appearance of the}} original fabric in varying degrees by a variety of techniques, materials and processes. It can make simple fabric form the new visual, tactile and auditory artistic effect. Traditional Chinese costume culture is profound, and it’s an important component of Chinese splendid civilization. Fabrics redesign came into being in abundant forms and accumulated to be important elements with the emergence and evolution of Chinese traditional costume. Embroidery technology is an ancient fabric redesign form in as early as the Shang dynasty. The twelve heraldries which adopted to decorate the emperor clothing appeared about from the Zhou dynasty were formed with embroidery. They are arranged as following with an implied means: sun, moon, stars, <b>mountains,</b> dragon, <b>pheasant,</b> two goblets, pondweed, flames, rice grains axe and bows.

2500|$|The {{field was}} reduced to seven when Gleneagles was {{withdrawn}} owing to the rain-softened ground and Golden Horn started the 4/9 favourite ahead of Time Test and The Grey Gatsby with the other runners being Criterion from Australia (Australian <b>Derby),</b> Cougar <b>Mountain</b> from Ireland (Desmond Stakes), the British filly Arabian Queen and the seven-year-old gelding Dick Doughtywylie, who was acting as a pacemaker for the favourite. Golden Horn pulled hard against Dettori's attempts to restrain him {{in the early stages}} and raced in third behind Dick Doughtywylie and Arabian Queen. He made a forward move in the straight, moving up outside the leader Arabian Queen a furlong out and sustained his first defeat, finishing a neck behind the filly. After the race Dettori commented [...] "The horse was more keen than usual today and the ground being the way it was, he couldn’t use his turn of foot. It’s a great shame, but this is racing".|$|R

It then follows Anthony Creek down to the Greenbrier River near the present Pocahontas - Greenbrier County line, then ascending toward Hillsboro and Droop Mountain. It crossed through present Pocahontas County by way of Marlinton, Indian Draft Run, and Edray. Passing into present Randolph County, it descended the Tygart Valley River from its headwaters and passed through {{the vicinity of}} present-day Elkins, after which it proceeded north by ascending Leading Creek. It left Randolph County after crossing <b>Pheasant</b> <b>Mountain,</b> and descended the Left Fork of Clover Run into present-day Tucker County. Crossing the Shavers Fork of the Cheat River, it exited Tucker county and West Virginia by way of Horseshoe Run northeast of St. George, crossing the Potomac River near Oakland, Maryland.|$|R

In March 2009, the league announced its inaugural six-bout season in Troy. The Hellions currently skate at Rollarama Skating Center in Schenectady, and play under the WFTDA reulset.

40|$|The <b>mountain</b> peacock <b>{{pheasant}}</b> (Polyplectron inopinatum), the Malayan peacock pheasant (Polyplectron malacense), and the Congo peafowl (Afropavo congensis) are all {{listed as}} vulnerable to extinction under the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Here the authors report fatal infection {{with a novel}} herpesvirus in all 3 species of birds. DNA was extracted from the livers of birds with hepatocellular necrosis and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions consistent with herpesvirus infection. Based on degenerate herpesvirus primers and polymerase chain reaction, 220 – and 519 –base pair products of the herpes DNA polymerase and DNA terminase genes, respectively, were amplified. Sequence analysis revealed that all birds were likely infected with the same virus. At the nucleotide level, the pheasant herpesvirus had 92 % identity with gallid herpesvirus 3 and 77. 7 % identity with gallid herpesvirus 2. At the amino acid level, the herpes virus had 93. 8 % identity with gallid herpesvirus 3 and 89. 4 % identity with gallid herpesvirus 2. These findings indicate that the closest relative to this novel herpesvirus is gallid herpesvirus 3, a nonpathogenic virus used widely in a vaccine against Marek’s disease. In situ hybridization using probes specific to the peacock pheasant herpesvirus DNA polymerase revealed strong intranuclear staining in the necrotic liver lesions of an infected Malayan peacock pheasant but no staining in normal liver from an uninfected bird. The phasianid herpesvirus reported here is a novel member of the genus Mardivirus of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and is distinct from other galliform herpesviruses...|$|R
5000|$|Chinese classic texts {{began using}} panlong in the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). The (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi (8, tr. Morgan 1934:95) first records panlong as a {{decorative}} style on Chinese bronzes. Great bells and tripods, beautiful vessels, {{works of art}} are manufactured. The decorations cast on these have been superb. The <b>mountain</b> dragon, or <b>pheasant,</b> and all animals of variegated plumage, the aquatic grass, flamboyants and grains of cereals were engraven on them, one symbol interwoven with another. The sleeping rhinoceros and crouching tiger, the dragon, wreathed in coils, were wrought. The later term panlongwen 蟠龍文 [...] "coiled-dragon pattern/design (on bronzes, pillars, etc.)" [...] compares with panchiwen 蟠螭紋 (see chilong 螭龍) and panqiuwen 蟠虯紋 (see qiulong 虯龍). Another Huainanzi context (15, tr. Morgan 1934:199) lists longshepan 龍蛇蟠 (lit. [...] "dragon snake coiling") [...] "serpentine passage" [...] as a good ambush location. An exiguous pass, a ferry pontoon, a great mountain, a serpentine defile, a cul-de-sac, a dangerous pitfall, a narrow ravine, full of winding ways like the intestines of a sheep, a hole like a fisher's net, which admits, but from {{which there is no}} exit, are situations in which one man can hold back a thousand.|$|R
