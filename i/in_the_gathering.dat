5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that {{going to war with}} Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E

50|$|Mufti Sahib gave Bay'at (Pledge of Allegiance for Spirituality) in 1349 A.H. to Shaykh Zakariyyah Kandhalwi while Mufti Sahib was at Deoband. When {{he used to}} sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gatherings</b> of Hadhrat Raipuri and Hadhrat Dehlawi or Hadhrat Madani, he used {{to become}} very {{inclined}} toward the Hereafter. However when Mufti Sahib used to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gatherings</b> of Shaykh Zakariyyah, Mufti Sahib would be so affected, that his own sins and flaws would become manifest to him, {{as a result of}} which Mufti Sahib {{came to the conclusion that}} his Islaah (Spiritual Reformation) would take place only at the hands of Shaykh Zakariyyah. This was the first reason of Mufti Sahib in giving preference to Shaykh Zakariyyah for Bay'at.|$|R
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering</b> darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering</b> darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

25|$|After {{three months}} of {{provisional}} government, on 28 February 1991, a charter was approved for Chad with Déby as president. During the following two years, Déby faced a series of coup attempts as government forces clashed with pro-Habré rebel groups, such as the Movement for Democracy and Development (MDD).

While Humphreys was still attacking, Hooker reluctantly ordered the IX Corps division of Brig. Gen. George W.

25|$|As {{the crisis}} deepened, with the Ulster Volunteers {{drilling}} openly, Churchill {{arranged for a}} Royal Naval battleship squadron to cruise off Belfast without first raising the issue in Cabinet. Asquith cancelled the move two days later. The cancellation is not mentioned <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> Storm. It appeared to the Unionist leaders that Churchill and his friend War Secretary John Seely were seeking to provoke the Unionists into some outward act that would allow Ulster to be placed under some form of military rule. The attempts to move troops led to the Curragh Incident, Seely's resignation, a backdown by the Government, and negotiations brokered by King George V.|$|E
25|$|Just then, {{disaster}} struck. Further {{south along}} the center of Bragg's line, Federal troops under General Thomas smashed through Confederate positions {{at the base of}} the ridge, sweeping up the hill and driving Bragg's men before them. With his army disintegrating before his eyes, Bragg ordered Cleburne to hold the Federals off long enough to let the rest of his men escape. The 33rd Alabama attacked approaching skirmishers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering</b> darkness, allowing the remainder of Bragg's army to cross Chickamauga Creek to the east, and retreat into Georgia. Since his forces had held more-or-less together during the rout, Cleburne now found his divisionincluding the 33rd Alabamaserving as the rearguard of the Army of Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|Karadžić {{continued}} collecting song {{well into}} the 1830s. He arrived in Montenegro {{in the fall of}} 1834. Infirm, he descended to the Bay of Kotor to winter there, and returned in the spring of 1835. It was there that Karadžić met Vuk Vrčević, an aspiring littérateur, born in Risan. From then on Vrčević became Karadžić's faithful and loyal collaborator who collected folk songs and tales and sent them to his address in Vienna for many years to come. Another equally diligent collaborator of Vuk Karadžić was another namesake from Boka Kotorska the Priest Vuk Popović. Both Vrčević and Popović were steadily and uselfishly involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gathering</b> of the ethnographic, folklore and lexical material for Karadžić.

Brown did not attack, however. His brigade commander on the right, Brig. Gen. Otho F.

25|$|Churchill was wary of Adolf Hitler's {{potential}} danger {{as early as}} 1930. More than two years before Hitler took power in January 1933, Churchill warned at a dinner at the German Embassy that Hitler and his followers would start a war as soon as possible. Beginning in 1932, when he opposed those who advocated giving Germany the right to military parity with France, Churchill spoke often {{of the dangers of}} German rearmament. Later, particularly <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gathering</b> Storm, he tried to portray himself as being for a time, a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen itself against Germany. However Lord Lloyd was the first to so agitate. Churchill also tried to portray himself as warning against German rearmament as early as 1930 and as opposing what he saw as British disarmament at and before that time. He omits the fact that as Chancellor of the Exchequer he had imposed the heavy defence cuts referred to above.|$|E

Morgan continued east to the Ohio River where, just north of modern Ravenswood, West Virginia, there was a ford at Buffington Island {{that would allow him}} to cross over into that state. Burnside correctly guessed Morgan's intentions. Federal columns under Edward H. Hobson and Henry M. Judah and river gunboats swiftly converged to contest any river crossing.
