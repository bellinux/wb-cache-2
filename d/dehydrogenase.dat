5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate <b>dehydrogenase</b> deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection). The three major types of inherited genetic resistance (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate <b>dehydrogenase</b> deficiency) were present in the Mediterranean world {{by the time of the}} Roman Empire, about 2000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol <b>dehydrogenase</b> and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|In some studies, age >60 {{years and}} {{elevated}} lactate <b>dehydrogenase</b> level were {{also associated with}} poorer outcomes. As with most forms of cancer, performance status (i.e. the general physical condition and activity level of the person) {{plays a major role}} in prognosis as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dehydrogenases</b> are a {{subclass}} of {{the class}} of enzymes called “oxidoreductases.” Oxidoreductases, in general, catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions. These enzymes fall into six categories: oxygenases, reductases, peroxidases, oxidases, hydroxylases, and <b>dehydrogenases.</b> Most oxidoreductase enzymes are <b>dehydrogenases,</b> although reductases are also common. The accepted nomenclature for <b>dehydrogenases</b> is [...] "donor dehydrogenase," [...] where the donor is the substrate that can be oxidized.|$|R

Procion Red HE- 3 B columns retarded NADP+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases</b> {{more effectively than}} NAD+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases,</b> whilst immobilized Cibacron Blue F 3 G-A retarded NAD+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases</b> more effectively than NADP+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases.</b> The capacity of procion Red HE- 3 B-Sepharose CL- 4 B for five <b>dehydrogenases</b> was highest {{in the region of}} 70 nmol of immobilized ligand/ml of settled gel. The effects of using poly(ethyleneimine) as a spacer for both porous and pellicular supports were also examined. Four NADP+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases</b> were purified from yeast extract by using Procion Red HE- 3 B-Sepharose CL- 4 B. Two NAD+-dependent <b>dehydrogenases</b> were purified from the same source using Cibacron Blue F 3 G-A-Sepharose CL- 4 B. These results are discussed in relation to the use of immobilized Procion Red HE- 3 B to purify <b>dehydrogenases.</b> This immobilized dye's chromatograhic behaviour is compared with that of immobilized nucleotides. The most important feature of immobilized tirazine dyes seems to be their high operational capacities when compared with group-specific nucleotide adsorbents...|$|R
40|$|The N-terminal {{sequences}} of malate <b>dehydrogenases</b> from 10 bacterial strains, representing seven genera of Proteobacteria, were determined. Of these, the enzyme {{sequences of}} species {{classified in the}} genus Brevundimonas clearly resembled those malate <b>dehydrogenases</b> with greatest similarity to lactate <b>dehydrogenases.</b> Additional evidence from subunit molecular weights, peptide mapping, and enzyme mobilities suggested that malate <b>dehydrogenases</b> from species of the genus Brevundimonas were structurally distinct from others in the study...|$|R
5|$|According to a 2005 review, due to {{the high}} levels of {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate <b>dehydrogenase</b> deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{exposure}} to ambient Mn air concentrations {{in excess of}} 5 μg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate <b>dehydrogenase</b> leakage.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol <b>dehydrogenase</b> of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E

25|$|The {{family also}} {{contains}} L-lactate <b>dehydrogenases</b> that catalyse {{the conversion of}} L-lactate to pyruvate, the last step in anaerobic glycolysis. Malate <b>dehydrogenases</b> that catalyse the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate {{and participate in the}} citric acid cycle, and L-2-hydroxyisocaproate <b>dehydrogenases</b> are also members of the family. The N-terminus is a Rossmann NAD-binding fold and the C-terminus is an unusual alpha+beta fold.|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate and {{invertebrate}} L-lactate <b>dehydrogenases</b> (L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 27) {{are effectively}} bound to oxamate-diaminohexyl-Sepharose, whereas several D-lactate <b>dehydrogenases</b> (D-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 28) do not bind {{to the same}} Sepharose. One explanation for our findings is that the enzymes' substrate is oriented in a reversed manner in the active center of the D- and L-lactate <b>dehydrogenases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate <b>dehydrogenase</b> found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate <b>dehydrogenase</b> and pyruvate <b>dehydrogenase.</b> In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol <b>dehydrogenase</b> of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E

50|$|Deactivation of {{aldehyde}} <b>dehydrogenases</b> {{has been}} shown to be instrumental in the mechanisms of many cancers. ALDHs function in cell differentiation, proliferation, oxidation, and drug resistance. These enzymes are only one example of the many different types of <b>dehydrogenases</b> in the human body; their wide array of functions, and the impact that their deactivation or mutations has upon crucial cell processes underscores the importance of all <b>dehydrogenases</b> in maintaining body homeostasis.|$|R
5|$|The enzymes of the {{citric acid}} cycle {{are located in}} the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, with the exception of succinate <b>dehydrogenase,</b> which is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex II. The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2) that are a source of electrons for the electron transport chain, and a molecule of GTP (that is readily converted to an ATP).|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of cysts is induced {{by changes in}} the concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as ethanol, n-butanol, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Cysts are rarely formed in liquid media. The {{formation of}} cysts is induced by chemical factors and is accompanied by metabolic shifts, changes in catabolism, respiration, and biosynthesis of macromolecules; it is also affected by aldehyde <b>dehydrogenase</b> and the response regulator AlgR.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{contains}} a cyclopropylglutamine compound called coprine. Its active metabolite, 1-aminocyclopropanol, blocks {{the action of}} an enzyme, acetaldehyde <b>dehydrogenase,</b> which breaks down acetaldehyde in the body. Acetaldehyde is an intermediate metabolite of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover; its effect on autonomic β receptors {{is responsible for the}} vasomotor symptoms.|$|E
50|$|However, not all retinol <b>dehydrogenases</b> {{in visual}} cycle are identified, and this remains {{challenging}} to scientists {{due to the}} overlapping expressions and activity redundancy among two large RDH and RDH-like producing classes: microsomal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase and cytosolic medium-chain alcohol <b>dehydrogenases.</b>|$|R

Whereas members of the AKR family are soluble, cytoplasmic enzymes, SDR-type hydroxysteroid <b>dehydrogenases</b> are also located to other subcellular compartments, i. e. endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria or peroxisomes. Differential localization might {{play an important role}} in influencing the reaction direction of hydroxy dehydrogenase/oxo reductase pathways by determining the available nucleotide cofactor pool. Targeting signals for different subcellular organelles in human hydroxysteroid <b>dehydrogenases</b> have been identified, however, in several enzymes localization signals remain to be determined...|$|R
5|$|The main role of NAD in {{metabolism}} is {{the transfer}} of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by {{a large group of}} enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH <b>dehydrogenase</b> or sometimes coenzyme Q reductase.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} mineral, including to prenatal and postnatal development. Zinc deficiency affects about two billion people {{in the developing world}} and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol <b>dehydrogenase</b> in humans. Consumption of excess zinc can cause ataxia, lethargy and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate <b>dehydrogenase</b> (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as aldolase, troponin, carbonic anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
40|$|Gluconobacter oxydans {{is famous}} for its rapid and {{incomplete}} oxidation {{of a wide range of}} sugars and sugar alcohols. The organism is known for its efficient oxidation of D-glucose to D-gluconate, which can be further oxidized to two different keto-D-gluconates, 2 -keto-D-gluconate and 5 -keto-D-gluconate, as well as 2, 5 -di-keto-D-gluconate. For this oxidation chain and for further oxidation reactions, G. oxydans possesses a high number of membrane-bound <b>dehydrogenases.</b> In this review, we focus on the <b>dehydrogenases</b> involved in D-glucose oxidation and the products formed during this process. As some of the involved <b>dehydrogenases</b> contain pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a cofactor, also PQQ synthesis is reviewed.

40|$|During aerobic respiration, cells produce energy through {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{which includes}} a specialized group of multi-subunit complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane known as the electron transport chain.

40|$|Sex steroid hormones such as estrogens and androgens are {{involved}} in the development and differentiation of the breast tissue. The activity and concentration of sex steroids is determined by the availability from the circulation, and on local conversion. This conversion is primarily mediated by aromatase, steroid sulfatase, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid <b>dehydrogenases.</b> In postmenopausal women, this is the primary source of estrogens in the breast. Up to 70 - 80 % of all breast cancers express the estrogen receptor-a, responsible for promoting the growth of the tissue. Further, 60 - 80 % express the androgen receptor, which has been shown to have tissue protective effects in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, and a more ambiguous response in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. In this review, we summarize the function and clinical relevance in cancer for 17 beta-hydroxysteroid <b>dehydrogenases</b> 1, which facilitates the reduction of estrone to estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone to androstendiol and dihydrotestosterone to 3 alpha- and 3 beta-diol as well as 17 beta-hydroxysteroid <b>dehydrogenases</b> 2 which mediates the oxidation of estradiol to estrone, testosterone to androstenedione and androstendiol to dehydroepiandrosterone.
