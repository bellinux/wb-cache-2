2500|$|Some species {{reproduce}} {{exclusively by}} parthenogenesis (such as the Bdelloid rotifers), while others can switch between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. This is called facultative parthenogenesis (other terms are cyclical parthenogenesis, <b>heterogamy</b> or heterogony). The switch between sexuality and parthenogenesis in such species may {{be triggered by}} the season (aphid, some gall wasps), or {{by a lack of}} males or by conditions that favour rapid population growth (rotifers and cladocerans like daphnia). In these species asexual reproduction occurs either in summer (aphids) or as long as conditions are favourable. This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who won't give birth. In times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non-sister chromosomes, a process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions.

50|$|In sociology, <b>heterogamy</b> {{refers to}} a {{marriage}} between two individuals that differ in a certain criterion, and is contrasted with homogamy for a marriage or union between partners that match according to that criterion. For example, ethnic <b>heterogamy</b> refers to marriages involving individuals of different ethnic groups. Age <b>heterogamy</b> refers to marriages involving partners of significantly different ages. <b>Heterogamy</b> and homogamy are also used to describe marriage or union between people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.|$|E
50|$|In {{reproductive}} biology, <b>heterogamy</b> is the alternation of differently organized generations, {{applied to}} the alternation between parthenogenetic and a sexual generation. This type of <b>heterogamy</b> occurs for example in some aphids.|$|E
50|$|The {{housefly}} is {{an object}} of biological research, mainly because of one remarkable quality: the sex determination mechanism. Although {{a wide variety of}} sex determination mechanisms exist in nature (e.g. male and female <b>heterogamy,</b> haplodiploidy, environmental factors), the way sex is determined is usually fixed within one species. The housefly is thought to exhibit several different mechanisms for sex determination, such as male <b>heterogamy</b> (like most insects and mammals), female <b>heterogamy</b> (like birds) and maternal control over offspring sex. The exact mechanism of sex determination in the housefly is, however, still unresolved.|$|E

50|$|In {{reproductive}} biology, <b>heterogamy</b> or heterogamous {{is often}} used as a synonym of heterogametic, meaning the presence of two unlike chromosomes in a sex. For example, XY males and ZW females are called the heterogamous sex.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Heterogamy</b> (Ancient Greek ἕτερος heteros = [...] "other, another" [...] + γάμος gámos = [...] "marriage") - in {{cell biology}} - is a synonym of anisogamy, {{involving}} differently sized {{male and female}} gametes produced by different sexes or mating types in a species.|$|E
50|$|Anisogamy (also called <b>heterogamy)</b> is {{the form}} of sexual {{reproduction}} that involves the union or fusion of two gametes, which differ in size and/or form. (The related adjectives are anisogamous and anisogamic). The smaller gamete {{is considered to be}} male (sperm cell), whereas the larger gamete is regarded as female (egg cell).|$|E
50|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} is by simultaneous division of all {{cells of the}} colony to form autocolonies that are liberated by a gelatinization of the colonial envelope. Sexual reproduction occurs by division of each cell of the colony into 16-32 zoogametes. Zoogametes show indications of <b>heterogamy,</b> a slight difference in the size and motility of the pairs that fuse to form the smooth walled zygote.|$|E
50|$|The form of <b>heterogamy</b> {{that occurs}} in animals, {{including}} humans, is oogamy. In oogamy, a large, non-motile egg (ovum) is fertilized by a small, motile sperm (spermatozoon). The egg is optimized for longevity, whereas the small sperm is optimized for motility and speed. The size and resources of the egg cell allow {{for the production of}} pheromones, which attract the swimming sperm cells.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Chamisso and Steenstrup {{described}} {{the succession of}} differently organized generations (sexual and asexual) in animals as [...] "alternation of generations", while studying the development of tunicates, cnidarians and trematodes. This phenomenon {{is also known as}} <b>heterogamy.</b> Presently, the term [...] "alternation of generations" [...] is almost exclusively associated with the life cycles of plants, specifically with the alternation of haploid gametophytes and diploid sporophytes.|$|E
5000|$|Alternation {{between a}} {{multicellular}} diploid and a multicellular haploid generation is never encountered in animals. In some animals, {{there is an}} alternation between parthenogenic and sexually reproductive phases (<b>heterogamy).</b> Both phases are diploid. This has sometimes been called [...] "alternation of generations", but is quite different. In some other animals, such as hymenopterans, males are haploid and females diploid, but this is always the case rather than there being an alternation between distinct generations.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{simplest}} Volvocaceans are colonial organisms {{but others are}} truly multicellular organisms. Larger volvocaceans have evolved a specialized form of <b>heterogamy</b> called oogamy, the production of small motile sperm by one mating type and relatively larger immotile eggs by another. Among the Volvocaceans are thus {{the simplest}} organisms with distinguishable male and female members. In all Volvocaceans, the fertilization reaction results {{in the production of}} a dormant diploid zygote (zygospore) capable of surviving in harsh environments. Once conditions have improved the zygospore germinates and undergoes meiosis to produce haploid offspring of both mating types.|$|E
50|$|Oogamy is the {{familiar}} form of sexual reproduction. It {{is a form}} of anisogamy (<b>heterogamy)</b> in which the female gamete (e.g. egg cell) is significantly larger than the male gamete and is non-motile. The male gametes are typically highly motile to the zygote, but it is usually tasked with all of the travel necessary to bring the respective gametes together. The prevalence of oogamy in higher animals leads to the conclusion that this specialization of the gametes results in their performing their respective tasks better and more efficiently than those tasks could be performed by generalist isogametes, particularly the ability to concentrate high-energy substances in a smaller number of ova.|$|E
5000|$|Filter {{theory is}} a sociological theory {{concerning}} dating and mate selection. It proposes that social structure limits {{the number of}} eligible candidates for a mate. Most often, this takes place due to homogamy, as people seek to date and marry only those similar to them (characteristics that are often taken into account are age, race, social status and religion). Homogamy {{is the idea of}} marriage between spouses who share similar characteristics, where <b>heterogamy</b> denotes marriage between spouses of different characteristics. The idea of [...] "opposites attract: is heterogamous as well as the idea that one spouse has complementing, not similar characteristics to the other.|$|E
50|$|Assortative mating is a {{mating pattern}} and {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random mating pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative mating, also referred to as positive assortative mating or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative mating can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or <b>heterogamy)</b> in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating. In both cases, due to the nonrandom mating pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|E
50|$|Some species {{alternate}} between the sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as <b>heterogamy,</b> depending on conditions. Alternation is observed in several rotifer species (cyclical parthenogenesis e.g. in Brachionus species) {{and a few}} types of insects, such as aphids which will, under certain conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, thus cloning themselves. The cape bee Apis mellifera subsp. capensis can reproduce asexually through a process called thelytoky. A few species of amphibians, reptiles, and birds have a similar ability (see parthenogenesis for examples).For example, the freshwater crustacean Daphnia reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to sexual reproduction as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Another example are monogonont rotifers of the genus Brachionus, which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis: at low population densities females produce asexually and at higher densities a chemical cue accumulates and induces the transition to sexual reproduction. Many protists and fungi {{alternate between}} sexual and asexual reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein [...] "to marry") is a {{haploid cell}} that fuses with another haploid cell during {{fertilization}} (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, {{and in which}} each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. This {{is an example of}} anisogamy or <b>heterogamy,</b> the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.|$|E

40|$|Socio-demographic <b>heterogamy</b> is {{commonly}} believed {{to lead to}} lower relationship stability due {{to the presence of}} cultural differences between partners. This explanation lacks empirical support, as psychology studies have not confirmed the link between <b>heterogamy</b> and cultural differences, whereas sociological studies have been characterized by problems related to the choice and measurement of cultural differences. Progressing from previous research, this article examines the specific link between educational <b>heterogamy</b> and cultural differences in the domain of child-rearing. Results partly confirm the alternative hypotheses of child-rearing values and behaviors being subject to gender differences and processes of selection between partners. Nonetheless, they also indicate a positive link between educational <b>heterogamy</b> and differences in child-rearing values and behaviors between partners...|$|E
40|$|The {{detrimental}} effect of <b>heterogamy</b> on relationship quality and stability {{is well established}} in sociological theory. However, empirical research has failed to provide unequivocal support for this view. An important reason for {{this appears to be}} at a conceptual level. Focusing on educational <b>heterogamy,</b> two types of effects have been commonly examined under the banner of <b>heterogamy</b> effects: 1. the effect of the educational difference between the partners, and 2. the interaction effect between the levels of education of the partners. Despite representing two conceptually different views on <b>heterogamy</b> effects, previous research has failed to distinguish between them. This paper presents the theoretical distinction between both <b>heterogamy</b> effects, and empirically analyses them. This is done using Diagonal Reference Models – a technique from social mobility research that is particularly useful for analyzing <b>heterogamy</b> effects. Based on data concerning 643 couples from the survey Child-rearing and family in the Netherlands, it is shown that the effect of the educational difference is felt by both men and women as both report the highest marital satisfaction in marriages where the educational difference is to the advantage of the husband. In addition, men, but not women, are subject to the interaction effect, as the importance of his level of education in determining his own degree of marital satisfaction is accentuated, the more the educational balance in the couple is to his advantage. These results illustrate how conceptual clarification, in combination with the appropriate analysis technique may advance the field of <b>heterogamy</b> research...|$|E
40|$|This study extends earlier {{research}} on educational inequality and health in two ways. First, we examine whether own educational level and spouse’s educational level are independently associated with self-assessed health throughout European societies by analysing 29 countries simultaneously. Second, we ask {{to what extent}} educational <b>heterogamy</b> at the country level is related to health differences between and within countries. Theories on social capital lead to the hypotheses that average health is better in countries with more educational <b>heterogamy,</b> and educational differentiation in health is smaller in countries with more educational <b>heterogamy.</b> To test our expectations, we use individual data from the European Social Survey of 2002, 2004, and 2006 (N¼ 59, 314) as well as country-level data. Using multilevel analyses, we find that not only one’s own educational level, but additionally the spouse’s level of education positively affects selfassessed health in Europe. The degree of educational <b>heterogamy</b> does not influence the average level of self-assessed health in a country. However, the positive relationships between own and partner’s education and self-assessed health are weaker as the degree of educational <b>heterogamy</b> {{at the national level}} is higher. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Heterogamy</b> {{is linked}} to less {{effective}} contraceptive use amongst adolescents. It is not known whether this holds for married/cohabiting women, though the couple context of dating partners differs from stable relationships with respect to communication and power. We explore the association between <b>heterogamy</b> and women’s choice of contraception by analyzing partnered women from the 2006 - 2010 National Survey of Family Growth. Multinomial logistic regressions are used to determine whether educational, age or racial <b>heterogamy</b> {{is associated with the}} use of effective contraceptive methods. Women aged 20 - 34 in heterogamous relationships are less likely to use any type of contraception relative to no method. The more dimensions on which a couple differs, the less likely they are to use effective contraception. There were no consistent associations between <b>heterogamy</b> and contraceptive choice among women aged 35 - 45. Despite the more permanent nature of these relationships, differences between partners may factor into the contraceptive decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Heterogamy</b> is {{commonly}} considered detrimental to relationships {{because of its}} hypothesized link with cultural differences and social disapproval. Focusing on the link with cultural differences, this explanation lacks solid empirical support. The scarce studies encounter problems related to the choice and measurement of cultural differences, while psychology oriented studies have generally not confirmed this link. In addition, the wide theoretical base that supports this link, is challenged {{by a number of}} empirical considerations that cast doubt on the cultural similarity of homogamous couples (e. g. gender differences in values and behaviors), and the quasi-mechanical effect that is assumed to lead to cultural differences for heterogamous couples (e. g. selection on values and behaviors). Progressing from the inconclusive findings of previous studies, this study examines the theoretically founded link between educational <b>heterogamy,</b> as <b>heterogamy</b> in achieved characteristics is asserted most important for cultural differences, and cultural differences concerning child-rearing. In addition, Diagonal Reference Models are used to analyze the individually measured values and behaviors of both partners, as couples data from the Netherlands are used (survey Child-rearing and family in the Netherlands). Results indicate that education shows the expected positive association with the child-rearing behaviours of support, and the expected negative association with the child-rearing behaviours of negative control and the child-rearing values of adaptation. However, for educational <b>heterogamy,</b> the situation appears more complex, as results show that homogamous couples are not free of cultural differences either (e. g. gender differences in negative control), while the degree of cultural differences is affected by other important factors as well (e. g. processes of selection). Nevertheless, a positive link between educational <b>heterogamy</b> and cultural differences was found for support and adaptation. For negative control, a different mechanism appeared to be at work with increased negative control for both partners in heterogamous couples. While this does not support the hypothesis of increased cultural differences for heterogamous couples, it does fit with the idea of <b>heterogamy</b> leading to problems in heterogamous families...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{founding}} studies (Girard, 1964) (Bozon, Heran, 1987, 1988) (Singly, 1984) {{have shown}} that heterosexual couples are structured according a double logic, that of social homogamy and sexual <b>heterogamy</b> thereby ensuring the reproduction of social order and gendered order. This paper aims at reexamining the issue of couples'configuration, focusing on cases of woman's hypogamy (where the woman is more qualified than her partner). How do these situations of atypical <b>heterogamy</b> affect the reproductions of social and gendered order within the family? This study {{is based on the}} findings of the " Families and employers " INED study caried out in 2004 on 2719 couples ages 25 - 49 and follow up interviews on a sample of couples in which the woman is significantly more highly qualified than the man. The findings do not show major changes but changes in emphasis. First, <b>heterogamy,</b> and femal hypogamy, will be measured. <b>Heterogamy</b> is slightly on the increase, but women are more often hypergamous than hypogamous, even if the latter shows a slight increase. Moreover, the sex inversion of <b>heterogamy</b> (female if the diploma is taken as criterion or male if the social category is) proves how difficult it may be for women to find a job which really corresponds to their diploma and qualifications. The interviews focused on situations of woman's hypogamy and confirm that the sexual division of work (domestic work especially) is only slightly affected, even in a configuration that may have been deemed much more favorable for women. We nevertheless noticed some specific features (which distinguish hypogamous women more from other women than from men) : overqualified women (compared to their partner) tend to be more stable in their jobs and more involved in their work. The interviews revealed a greater autonomy of these women as regards their work, but their career does not necessarily have priority within the couple. These findings are congruent withe research carried out in other countries (Tichenor, 2005) (Bittman and alii, 2003) (Mac Rae, 1986) ...|$|E

40|$|Background : Despite the {{increasing}} prevalence of cohabitation, {{knowledge of how}} socio-economic homogamy affects the stability of cohabiting unions is scant. Few studies have compared the effects of homogamy in both ascribed and achieved socio-economic status on union dissolution. Objective : Our aim is to determine how homogamy and <b>heterogamy</b> in educational level and parental social class affect the risk of cohabitation dissolution in Finland. Methods : We use unique Finnish register data that includes information on non-marital cohabitation. Cox regression is used to analyse the risk of dissolution in 20, 452 cohabitations. We examine the dissolution rates in all possible combinations of partner status, and analyse how these estimates deviate from the main effects of each partner's status. Results : According to the findings, homogamy in parental social class is of little consequence in cohabitation dissolution, although cohabitations between people from upper-white-collar and farmer families are disproportionately likely to dissolve. Educational differences between partners are more significant determinants of cohabitation stability: extreme <b>heterogamy</b> is {{associated with an increased}} separation risk, and homogamy decreases the separation risk among cohabitors with a higher university degree. Conclusions : In line with the perception that personal achievement is more significant than social origins in contemporary union dynamics, similarity in educational level increases cohabitation stability more than similarity in socio-economic origin. Although previous Nordic studies report little or no association between educational homogamy or <b>heterogamy</b> and marriage dissolution, our study shows that educational differences do matter in cohabiting unions...|$|E

Results suggest that religious <b>heterogamy</b> is more common in cohabiting unions than marriages. Results also suggest that cohabiting unions are more likely to dissolve than marriages, and the risk of separation is higher for religiously heterogamous cohabiting unions (especially those in which one partner is religious and the other is not) than religiously heterogamous marriages. Finally, there is evidence showing that some religiously heterogamous cohabiting couples have a higher risk of relationship dissolution than religious heterogamous married couples due to lower relationship quality. Overall, this study extends the religion and family literature by showing that religious differences may lead to greater instability for cohabiting relationships than marriages. religion, behavior, religious attendance, fathers, mothers, children...|$|E

The importance of these two factors for women’s relative labour market participation is compared between Belgium and Sweden – two European countries that share socio-economic features but differ regarding labour market and social policies. Multinomial logistic Diagonal Reference Models are used to analyse the pooled cross-sectional data of the EU-SILC 2004 - 2008. Our results show that women’s relative labour market participation is less education-driven in Sweden than in Belgium, and it is more related to the couple effect of educational <b>heterogamy</b> and the life cycle effect of the presence of (young) children, confirming more egalitarianism and family friendliness in Scandinavia than in continental Europe...|$|E
