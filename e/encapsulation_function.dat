40|$|Encapsulation is a {{founding}} principle of object-oriented programming: to this end, {{there have been}} a number of recent of proposals to increase programming languages' support for encapsulation. While many of these proposals are similar in concept, it is often difficult to describe their effects in practice, or to evaluate clearly how related proposals differ from each other. We are developing a general topological model of encapsulation for object-oriented languages, based on a program's object graph. Using this model, we can characterise a range of confinement, ownership, and alias protection schemes in terms of their underlying <b>encapsulation</b> <b>function.</b> This analysis should help programmers understand the encapsulation provided by programming languages, assist students to better compare and contrast the features of different languages, and help language designers to craft the encapsulation schemes of forthcoming programming languages...|$|E

30|$|Parasitic wasp venom {{has many}} effects on hosts, {{including}} inhibition {{of the host}} immune and reproductive systems, regulation of growth and development, endocrine regulation and targeted gene expression (Nakamatsu et al. 2002; Nakamatsu and Tanaka 2003, 2004 a, b, c; Zhang et al. 2004; Suzuki and Tanaka 2007; Kwon and Kim 2008; Nguyen et al. 2008; Martinson et al. 2014). For example, when Pieris rapae was parasitized by Cotesia rubecula, its hemolymph phenol oxidase (tyrosinase) activity was significantly reduced (Asgari et al. 2003). Cai et al. (2004) showed that venom of Pteromalus puparum could significantly inhibit the extension and <b>encapsulation</b> <b>functions</b> of hemocytes in P. rapae pupae, and could lead to hemocyte death. Webb and Luckhart (1994) suggested that venom and ovarian proteins of Campoletis sonorensis could inhibit the host’s early response by destroying the skeleton of host plasmatocytes and granulocytes. Moreover, the venom of Nasonia vitripennis accelerated host fat synthesis (Rivers and Denlinger 1995). For most parasitoids that lack polydnavirus (PDV) or teratocytes, venom is the most critical factor in regulating host physiology (Askew and Shaw 1986; Doury et al. 1997; Parkinson and Weaver 1999; Richards and Parkinson 2000; Dani et al. 2003; Cai et al. 2004; Li et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the design of}} a distributed parallel object system (DPOS) and its implementation using a graphical editing interface. DPOS brings together concepts of object-oriented programming and graphical programming with aspects of modern functional lan guages. Programs are defined as networks of active processes called “Process Objects ” and interconnecting communications lines. These active objects are independent single threaded programs that employ much of the modularity, <b>encapsulation</b> of <b>function,</b> and <b>encapsulation</b> of data found in sequential object-oriented programming. The system defines a clear and simple approach to generating and managing parallelism and interprocess communication in a distributed parallel environment. DPOS contributes several new solutions to the prob lems of distributed parallel programming that are improvements over existing systems. The key improvements of this system include: a more complete and versatile means of dynamic process creation; the specification of complex network topologies in an intuitively clear and understandable way; seperation of the management of parallelism from the definition of com putation; automatic resolution of low level critical section issues; the ability to design an...|$|R
40|$|Part 8 : LISP and Multi-domain RoutingInternational audienceCarrier-grade {{networks}} have often {{multiple layers of}} protocols. To tackle this heterogeneity, the Pseudo-Wire architecture provides <b>encapsulation</b> and decapsulation <b>functions</b> of protocols over Packet-Switched Networks. At the scale of multi-domain networks, computing a path to support an end-to-end service requires various encapsulations and decapsulations that can be nested but for which manual configurations are needed. Graph models are not expressive enough for this problem. In this paper, we propose an approach using graphs and Push-Down Automata (PDA) to capture the compatibility among encapsulations and decapsulations along an inter-domain path. They are respectively modeled as pushes and pops on a PDA’s stacks. We provide polynomial algorithms that compute either the shortest path in hops, or {{in the number of}} encapsulations and decapsulations to optimize interfaces’ configuration...|$|R

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} systems provide powerful {{mechanisms for}} separating concerns, but understanding how these concerns interact can be challenging. In particular, many aspect-oriented programming constructs can violate encapsulation, creating dependencies between concerns that make software evolution {{more difficult and}} error-prone. In this paper, we introduce Open Modules, a mechanism for enforcing a strong form of encapsulation while supporting much of the extensibility provided by languages like AspectJ. Open Modules provide extensibility by allowing clients to advise the interface of a module, but enforce <b>encapsulation</b> by protecting <b>function</b> calls made within the module from external advice. A module can expose semantically important internal events to client aspects through pointcuts in its interface. The module's implementation can change without affecting client advice {{as long as the}} semantics of the methods and pointcuts in its interface are preserved. Thus, open modules preserve much of the expressiveness of existing aspect-oriented programming techniques, while providing strong encapsulation guarantees even in the presence of aspects...|$|R

First, we {{discussed the}} WSRF based GIS <b>function</b> <b>encapsulation</b> details for legacy GIS system. Then we researched on the Grid GIS services dynamic monitoring and discovery mechanism and did some modifications to the Globus Toolkit 4 MDS (The Monitoring and Discovery System) tool to make it fit to our workflow framework better. The service integration and hybrid invocation mechanism in our prototype framework was described in the next part. Finally, we introduced the three main components of MGWF: a simple but visualized, easy-to-use Grid service workflow modeling IDE, a distributed process executor cluster and a pragmatic process template library. And we also give a Grid GIS service workflow examples to demonstrate the process of GIS workflow’s composition, generation and execution monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization has the {{potential}} to dramatically affect insect populations worldwide, although its effects on pollinator populations are just beginning to be understood. We compared the immunocompetency of honey bees sampled from feral (wild-living) and managed (beekeeper-owned) honey bee colonies. We sampled foragers from feral and managed colonies in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes in and around Raleigh, NC, USA. We then analyzed adult workers using two standard bioassays for insect immune <b>function</b> (<b>encapsulation</b> response and phenoloxidase activity). We found that there was far more variation within colonies for encapsulation response or phenoloxidase activity than among rural to urban landscapes, and we did not observe any significant difference in immune response between feral and managed bees. These findings suggest that social pollinators, like honey bees, may be sufficiently robust or variable in their immune responses to obscure any subtle effects of urbanization. Additional studies of immune physiology and disease ecology of social and solitary bees in urban, suburban, and natural ecosystems will provide insights into the relative effects of changing urban environments on several important factors that influence pollinator productivity and health...|$|R
40|$|Simple sugars (e. g., sucrose, glucose, and fructose) are abundantly used {{as basic}} {{ingredients}} in the food industry and as excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, due to the quality attributes they contribute to the final products, such as sweet taste, flavor, texture, color, shelf-life (e. g., flavor retention via <b>encapsulation),</b> and carrier <b>function</b> of active pharmaceutical components.

Thus, it is important to accurately and completely characterize the sugars prior to use in specific applications. Melting has been commonly used for sugar characterization because it is an easy and quick property to measure, yet is usually repeatable and robust. In general, melting is determined by heating a sugar at a specified scanning rate using a thermal analytical technique, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The sugar loses its crystalline structure (commonly termed melting) by adsorbing heat energy, which yields the critical parameters of the resultant melting peak, i. e., the onset melting temperature (Tm onset), the peak melting temperature (Tm peak), and the enthalpy of melting (∆H).

40|$|AbstractLiposomes {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the vesicle extrusion method (VETs) from mixtures of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine with covalently linked poly(ethylene glycol) molecular mass 5000 and 2000 (DPPE-PEG 5000 and DPPE-PEG 2000) covering a range of 0 – 7. 5 mole%. The encapsulation of D-glucose has been studied and found to be markedly dependent on the mole% DPPE-PEG. The permeability of the liposomes to D-glucose has been measured both {{as a function of}} temperature and liposome composition. The permeability coefficients for D-glucose increase with mole% DPPE-PEG 5000 and with temperature over the range 25 – 50 °C. The activation energies for glucose permeability range from 90 to 23 kJ mol− 1. The decrease in activation energy with increasing temperature is attributed to an increasing number of bilayer defects as the liposome content of PEG-grafted lipid is increased. The dependence of D-glucose <b>encapsulation</b> as a <b>function</b> of PEG-grafted lipid content is discussed in terms of the conformation of the PEG molecules on the inner surface of the bilayer. For liposomes containing DPPE-PEG 5000 the relative percentage encapsulation of glucose, assuming that the PEG surface layer excludes glucose, is comparable to that predicted from the mushroom and brush conformational models...|$|R
40|$|Fetal pig islet-like cell {{clusters}} (ICCs) were transplanted {{into the}} thymus or omentum of STZ-induced diabetic pigs immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CsA) and deoxyspergualin (DSG), {{as a potential}} treatment for type 1 diabetes. C-peptide levels in response to glucagon and arginine significantly increased over time using 1 litter of ICCs with highest levels obtained at 100 days post-transplantation. Increasing the number of ICCs to 2 litters was not advantageous. Histology of the graft showed all 4 pancreatic endocrine cells. Normoglycaemia was achieved for transient periods without insulin administration in 4 out of 12 pigs. These results suggest sub-optimal insulin production, possibly due to the adverse effects of CsA on the grafted &# 946; cells. The effect of CsA on adult porcine &# 946; cells was investigated and adverse effects were shown. Renal toxicity and adverse changes to the haematological parameters did not occur despite high CsA levels although minimal toxicity to the liver was observed. The {{results indicate that the}} use of CsA monotherapy in the maintenance phase to prevent rejection of allografted pancreatic &# 946; cells may become a subsequent problem over time. As an alternative to chronic immunossuppression, anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody was administered for 10 days in pigs. Using anti-CD 3 alone, only 1 out 4 pigs showed cells positive for insulin. The addition of a 5 -day CsA course administered the day before transplantation did not promote allograft survival. The use of DSG for 10 days with anti-CD 3 promoted graft survival with the histology showing the 4 endocrine cells 3 weeks post-transplantation. An attempt was made to replace any form of immunossuppression by encapsulating fetal pig ICCs in barium alginate, which were able to remain viable when transplanted in NOD/SCID mice. Fibrosis was detected in BALB/c mice transplanted with encapsulated fetal ICCs suggesting that fetal pig ICCs shed antigens that elicit an immune response. Results from this study show that although fetal pig ICCs may be a viable source of insulin-producing cells, the use of CsA to prevent rejection has adverse effects on graft <b>function.</b> <b>Encapsulation</b> as well as transient immunosuppression is worthy of further investigation to prevent rejection of fetal pig ICCs...|$|R

Melting has been commonly used for sugar characterization because it is an easy and quick property to measure, yet is usually repeatable and robust. In general, melting is determined by heating a sugar at a specified scanning rate using a thermal analytical technique, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The sugar loses its crystalline structure (commonly termed melting) by adsorbing heat energy, which yields the critical parameters of the resultant melting peak, i. e., the onset melting temperature (Tm onset), the peak melting temperature (Tm peak), and the enthalpy of melting (???H). These parameters provide a good deal of information for sugar identification and characterization (e. g., purity, type, size, etc.) purposes. However, the reported melting temperatures for sugars vary widely. This variation has been attributed to a number of causes, such as differences in melting temperature determination methods, origin, impurity, polymorphs, superheating, liquefaction, and thermal decomposition and/or mutarotation in addition to melting. However, a complete explanation of the substantial variation observed in the sugar melting temperatures as a function of heating rates is not currently found in the literature. Of importance to note is that from a thermodynamic viewpoint, the heating rate dependency of the sugar melting temperatures suggests that the sugars do not experience thermodynamic melting. Because thermodynamic melting occurs at a single, time independent temperature with a constant enthalpy value (??H), where the crystalline solid and corresponding liquid phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium (???G= 0) at a constant pressure, the melting parameters for the sugars cannot be used for identification purpose. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this research was to elucidate the fundamental mechanism underlying the loss of crystalline structure (melting) in these sugars. With thermal and chemical analytical approaches, this research found that the kinetic process of thermal decomposition was responsible for the loss of crystalline structure in these sugars, leading to heating rate dependency in their melting parameters. This result distinguishes thermodynamic melting from the loss of crystalline structure caused by thermal decomposition (termed ???apparent melting??? in this research), which solves the controversy that currently exists in the literature regarding the wide variation in the melting parameters of these sugars. These results prove not only that the loss of crystalline structure in the sugars is caused by thermal decomposition, but also that apparent melting in the sugars is achieved via a time-temperature combination process. This research also attempted to determine the thermodynamic melting temperature of these sugars by suppressing thermal decomposition using fast scanning rates. In the case of fructose, its thermodynamic melting was achieved. In addition, this research explored the effect of different heating conditions on the glass transition parameters for amorphous sucrose prepared by melt-quenching (i. e., melting followed by quick cooling) because melting-quenching is one of the common methods for preparing amorphous materials. The heating conditions employed directly effected the glass transition parameters obtained, where, in general, {{it was found that the}} longer time, lower temperature heating conditions resulted in lower glass transition temperature values. Therefore, in practical applications, this research is useful for better understanding the quality and stability issues associated with heat processed sugar-containing food and pharmaceutical products and for developing new sugar based products...|$|R
