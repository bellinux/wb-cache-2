25|$|Shepard {{became the}} first American in space by making a {{suborbital}} flight in May 1961. He went on to fly in the Apollo program and became the only Mercury astronaut {{to walk on the}} Moon. Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a pre-launch test for Apollo 1. Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95. Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of Project Gemini. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Project</b> Apollo, when he resigned and began training to fly on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, which he successfully did. Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission. Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in all three of those programs.|$|E

50|$|The types, {{dimensions}} and dynamics of humanitarian crises are dramatically increasing - in some instances, exponentially. Capacities needed to prevent, prepare for {{and respond to}} such crises go well beyond the humanitarian sector as presently configured, and require a much wider range of competencies and capacities as well as human and financial resources than normally used by humanitarian actors. Bringing together international representatives from the military, the humanitarian sector, governments {{and the private sector}} through a series of thematic focus groups, key informant interviews, a 1 ½ day scenario exercise, and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> workshop, the project will develop the knowledge base on the current and potential use of military capacities for humanitarian crisis prevention/risk reduction, preparedness and response.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1970, {{near the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Project</b> Apollo (1961-1972), Gerard K. O'Neill, an {{experimental}} physicist at Princeton University, {{was looking for}} a topic to tempt his physics students, most of them freshmen in engineering. He hit upon the idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats. To his surprise, the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes: cylinders 8 km in diameter and 32 km long, even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass. Also, the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays (almost free in the larger sizes), getting naturalistic sun angles, provision of power, realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors. O'Neill published an article about these colony proposals in Physics Today in 1974. (See the above illustration of such a colony, a classic [...] "O'Neill Colony"). He expanded the article in his 1976 book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project is}} trying out cost and time saving [...] "lean development" [...] {{engineering}} practices. Other project activities include appropriate ground operations, flight operations, range {{safety and the}} instigation of software development procedures. Landing pads and control centers were also constructed. [...] From the project start in July 2010, about $14 million was spent on materials in the following 4 years; so the Morpheus project is considered lean and low-cost for NASA. [...] In 2012 the project employed 25 full-time team members, and 60 students. [...] At any one time an average of 40 people worked on the project. Project Morpheus devised and used streamlined processes and practices. The Morpheus Lander's last flight was in December 2014. As there were no funds for further flights the lander was returned to JSC in February 2015. Six formal documents were produced by the project. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> review on March 12, 2015 {{it was estimated that}} $50 million had been saved by the lean development methods, minimising documentation, 'Beg and Borrowing' items and buying parts from home depot shops.|$|E

The Highlands Army Air Defense Site was completed at an existing SAGE radar station and cost ~$2 million for the new equipment and ~$2 million for the structures: 170 x 90 ft bunker, power building, and 4 radar towers (a Missile Master at a new radar station was $9 million). [...] Additional equipment and facilities included tankage for electricity generator fuel, storage for drinking & decontamination water, telephone lines, etc. In addition to the Martin Company's AN/FSG-1 subcontractors, the Corps of Engineers hired local construction contractors for the facility structures, e.g., Kirkland Construction for Ft Heath and Rust Engineering for the Oakdale Army Installation (the Corps tailored the bunker to each site from the [...] "baseline standard drawings".) [...] Each Missile Master had 200 total personnel, and maintenance of the AN/FSG-1, the radars, and other systems was provided by an Army [...] "Signal Missile Master Support Detachment" [...] of 10-15 soldiers.
