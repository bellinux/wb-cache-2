5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for bulking up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of <b>firelighters,</b> for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E

5000|$|In Interesting Times, The Silver Horde aid Cohen in his {{invasion}} of the Agatean Empire {{in an effort to}} steal something, which is hinted at but not revealed until the end to be the Empire itself. They also have a hand in overthrowing the current Emperor (a cruel tyrant who isn't [...] "simply at Death's door but well inside the hallway, admiring the carpet and commenting on the hatstand"). A main point of the plot is Teach's attempt to civilise the Horde, a difficult task since [...] "every one of them saw a book as either a lavatorial accessory or a set of portable <b>firelighters</b> and thought that hygiene was a greeting".|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} season, as Frank Rijkaard replaced Louis van Gaal as coach, Enke was loaned out to Turkish side Fenerbahçe - then {{managed by}} German coach Christoph Daum - {{as part of}} the deal that saw Rüştü Reçber move to the Spanish club. However, his career continued to stall as he managed to play just a solitary game there, a traumatic 0-3 defeat to Istanbulspor on 10 August 2003. His own fans pelted him with <b>firelighters</b> and bottles during the game, blaming him for this bitter defeat. These scenes caused Enke to immediately quit the club and his planned one-year loan and return to Spain. It was at this time that Enke suffered his first spell of depression, and led to him almost quitting football altogether.|$|E

Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders - signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as <b>firelighters.</b> The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after 21:00 on 27 February 1933, the Berlin Fire Department {{received}} {{a message that}} the Reichstag was on fire. Despite {{the best efforts of}} the firefighters, most of the building was gutted by the blaze. By 23:30, the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found twenty bundles of flammable material (<b>firelighters)</b> unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, Adolf Hitler was having dinner with Joseph Goebbels at Goebbels' apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels {{received a}}n urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a [...] "tall tale" [...] at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler. Both left Goebbels' apartment and arrived by car at the Reichstag, just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by Hermann Göring who told Hitler, [...] "This is Communist outrage! One of the Communist culprits has been arrested." [...] Hitler called the fire a [...] "sign from God" [...] and claimed it was a Fanal (signal) meant to mark the beginning of a Communist Putsch (revolt). The next day, the Preussische Pressedienst (Prussian Press Service) reported that [...] "this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany". The Vossische Zeitung newspaper warned its readers that [...] "the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists".|$|E

Often difficult to detect, young <b>firelighters</b> account for a fifth of the fires lit in Australia. The focus {{of this study was to}} explore the characteristics and profiles of young <b>firelighters</b> in an Australian sample and to determine the rate of recidivism and identify variables that may predict firelighting recidivism risk. The present research involved two separate parts. Study One involved the analysis of the Juvenile Fire Awareness and Intervention Program (JFAIP) database. A total of 661 cases were involved in this analysis with males accounting for 91. 5 %. The results suggest that there are significant associations between firelighting severity and age, gender, fire interest, receiving counselling, and level of planning prior to the firelighting incident. Fire interest decreased with age although fire curiosity was the most frequent motivation behind firelighting. Significant associations were also identified between age and motivation behind firelighting, actions following firelighting, and the ownership of firelighting episodes. Study Tw...|$|E
40|$|Arson {{costs the}} {{community}} approximately $ 600 million every year. Concerns were raised throughout 2002 that not enough {{was being done}} to protect the community from the devastation of deliberately lit bushfires. However, arsonists also target schools, homes, commercial premises and motor vehicles, so {{a wide variety of}} organisations have an interest in combating arson. Every Australian jurisdiction has introduced intervention programs that target juvenile <b>firelighters,</b> but only Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland have dedicated arson squads specifically trained to deal with fire scenes. This paper considers the motivations of arsonists, the difficulties in gaining convictions, and measures to minimise future incidents...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{investigated}} the VOC group benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEXs) produced during the combustion of forest fuel. The above analytes were chosen {{because they have}} been identified in other forest fires. As a result, <b>firelighters</b> and the general population can be exposed to hazardous concentrations of BTEXs during prescribed burning. Firefighters were equipped with Tenax adsorbent tubes and the BTEX concentrations analyzed by Automated Thermal Desorption - Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (ATDGC/MS). Total BTEX concentrations were measured in function of the distance from the flame front (between 1 and 10 meters, between 30 and 50 meters and between 100 and 150 meters) and the combustion phase (flaming and smoldering). The major compounds detected were benzene and toluene. Significant differences were observed between the data collected. BTEX concentrations were higher close to the flame front and during the smoldering phase. The benzene concentration (0. 093 - 18 mg. m- 3) exceeded the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL, 16 mg. m- 3) in samples collected during the smoldering phase at a distance of 1 to 10 meters from the flame front. Statistical analyses were carried out to summarize the results...|$|E
