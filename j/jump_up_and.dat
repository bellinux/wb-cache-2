5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
25|$|The Greek playwright Aristophanes {{noted the}} {{abortifacient}} property of pennyroyal in 421 BC, through a humorous reference in his comedy, Peace. Hippocrates, the Greek physician, would advise prostitutes who became pregnant to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, {{so as to}} induce miscarriage. Other writings attributed to him describe instruments fashioned to dilate the cervix and curette inside of the uterus.|$|E

25|$|Mario's primary {{attack is}} jumping {{on top of}} enemies, though many enemies have differing {{responses}} to this. For example, a Goomba will flatten and be defeated, while a Koopa Troopa will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario {{to use it as}} a projectile. These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him. Another attack, for enemies standing overhead, is to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hit beneath the brick that the enemy is standing on. Another is the Fire Flower; when picked up, this item changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs, or only upgrades Mario to Super Mario if he has not already. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to <b>jump</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E
500|$|Strawberry Field was {{the name}} of a Salvation Army children's home just around the corner from Lennon's {{childhood}} home in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool. Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton, Nigel Walley and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home. One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park, near the home, where a Salvation Army band played. Lennon's aunt Mimi Smith recalled: [...] "As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down shouting, 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Development of Rebound {{began in}} late 1973, {{as one of}} several {{variations}} they produced in 1974 on the gameplay of the successful Pong (1972), Atari's first game and the fourth-ever arcade game. Around the same time, Atari launched Kee Games, a subsidiary meant to produce clone games of Atari's products and act as a competitor in order to expand into more distribution channels in the same region than the industry typically supported. Kee's first game, released in March 1974, was Spike, a clone of Rebound, which added a [...] "spike" [...] button to the game that made the paddle <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attempt to bounce the ball downwards instead of up. In addition to the base game, Atari sold a conversion kit to convert any Atari two-player Pong variant into Rebound, and in 1977 Rebound was included in Video Olympics for the Atari 2600, a collection of Pong variants.|$|E

The CD and digital releases in the UK include the song [...] "Billie Holiday", written by Karlsson, Winnberg and Wyatt, as a B-side. A digital extended play (EP) with remixes by Crookers, Fake Blood, Fred Falke, Punks <b>Jump</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Style of Eye was released in European countries on 7 August 2009. Two remixes by Peter Bjorn and John and Mark Ronson were digitally released in the US on 8 December 2009. Ronson's remix also appears on the UK iTunes Store release of the band's next single, [...] "Black & Blue" [...] (2009), and was featured in the 2010 film Crazy, Stupid, Love. [...] "Animal" [...] was a minor chart success; it charted at number 98 in the issue dated 22 August 2009 of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|According to Gruff Rhys [...] "Do or Die" [...] has a [...] "ridiculously {{positive}} outlook" [...] and {{was written}} {{in an attempt to}} [...] "kickstart [...] back into gear" [...] after a bad period in the singer's life. The track is a [...] "driving song" [...] and features sampled car noises so that [...] "even if you're not in a car it feels like you are". Although Rhys has called the track a [...] "dumb pop song" [...] with [...] "really daft" [...] lyrics, he has also claimed that the title was inspired by the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to [...] "Do or Die" [...] and use non-violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India. Rhys has stated that he feels the fact that [...] "five-year-olds" [...] can <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down to the song, singing [...] "Gandhi lyrics", is important, as it contrasts with the [...] "self-important ... pompous" [...] lyrics of singers such as Jim Morrison and Robert Plant. The track was recorded in the middle of 1998 at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, {{along with the rest of}} Guerrilla, and was produced by Super Furry Animals.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the episode, {{numerous}} {{references are}} made to the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!, in which Jack tells Liz about his possible three fathers, Jack agreeing {{to meet with the}} three men, and Liz saying [...] "And all I'm promising is a madcap musical romp, dot dot dot, fun, dot dot dot, good.... That was on the [...] poster", and finally Jack revealing his kinship to Milton. Liz tells Jack that he should find out who his real father is, explaining [...] "If I have learned anything from my Sims family: When a child doesn't see his father enough he starts to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, then his mood level will drop until he pees himself." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Liz and Pete learn from James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) that Tracy's favorite television show is NCIS, a CBS police drama series revolving around special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who conduct criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Later, Liz and Pete sing the song [...] "It Takes Two" [...] by hip-hop duo Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock to see if Tracy is familiar with the song as they have doubts about the age Tracy claims to be.|$|E
500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. He puts a sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues to butt him. George must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must click on the farming machinery, which causes George to quickly <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|E
2500|$|Thurber {{was born}} in Columbus, Ohio, to Charles L. Thurber and Mary Agnes [...] "Mame" [...] (née Fisher) Thurber on December 8, 1894. Both of his parents greatly {{influenced}} his work. His father was a sporadically employed clerk and minor politician who dreamed of being a lawyer or an actor. Thurber described his mother as a [...] "born comedian" [...] and [...] "one of the finest comic talents I think I have ever known." [...] She was a practical joker and, on one occasion, pretended to be crippled and attended a faith healer revival, only to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> proclaim herself healed.|$|E

2500|$|Zwan's debut {{and only}} album was {{described}} as [...] "an efficient exercise {{in the kind of}} American alternative rock with big choruses that makes the boys at the front <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down." [...] The band's style is mostly pop-oriented and closer to mainstream pop rock, evoking [...] "the candied pop that characterized much of the Pumpkins later work." [...] Nevertheless, the songs also contrast with late Pumpkins material, being described as [...] "bright blast of tuneful guitar rock, as effervescent as the late Pumpkins material was gloomy." [...] In addition to being considered as power pop, the band's work also features guitarist David Pajo's post-rock textures.|$|E
2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which {{is connected to the}} core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
2500|$|A {{medley of}} [...] "Kansas City" [...] and [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey" [...] was sequenced {{as the final}} song on side one of the LP. In McCartney's description, his {{performance}} on the track required [...] "a great deal of nerve to just <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scream like an idiot"; his efforts were egged on by Lennon, who [...] "would go, 'Come on! You can sing it better than that, man! Come on, come on! Really throw it!'" [...] The medley was inspired by Little Richard, who similarly combined Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Kansas City" [...] with his own composition, [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!" [...] Riley considers that, although McCartney's presence on Beatles for Sale appears relatively slight next to Lennon's, his performance of [...] "Kansas City" [...] goes some way to readdressing the balance. Hertsgaard says that the irony evident in Harrison's delivery of [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" [...] "allows the Beatles to close the album with a not-so-veiled comment on the oddities of living inside Beatlemania".|$|E

2500|$|... "Christianity – {{and that}} is its {{greatest}} merit – has somewhat mitigated that brutal Germanic love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> smash the Gothic cathedrals. (...)"Do not smile at my advice – {{the advice of a}} dreamer who warns you against Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not smile at the visionary who anticipates the same revolution {{in the realm of the}} visible as has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when you hear a crashing such as never before has been heard in the world's history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens. A play will be performed in Germany which will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was named}} after the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be {{observed}} particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The song's lyrics were written by Rhys about [...] "the weather", and were inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern the singer saw on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. Rhys {{has said that he}} views [...] "The Turning Tide" [...] as more serious than the other tracks on Guerrilla. The song's lyrics are about living in a time of change and embracing change. Although [...] "Do or Die" [...] has [...] "really daft lyrics" [...] its title [...] was taken from the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to [...] "Do or Die" [...] and use non-violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India. Rhys has stated that he feels quite pleased that young children can <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down to the song, singing [...] "Gandhi lyrics". [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] is a comic, but also quite sinister, song about the possible effects of mobile phone radiation on people's health. Both [...] "Night Vision" [...] and [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] have lyrics inspired by the band's nights out in Cardiff. The former addresses bouncers who caused problems for the group by throwing them out of nightclubs, and the aggression that the band frequently witnessed on Saturday nights in the city. The latter is a very happy song about [...] "being in love and going out to the Hippo Club in Cardiff and feeling bulletproof and unstoppable".|$|E
