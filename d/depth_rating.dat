50|$|At the BaselWorld {{watch and}} {{jewellery}} show 2009, the CX Swiss Military Watch 20'000 FEET diving watch with an official <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> of 6000 m was introduced. This watch represented in its launch year, 2009, the most water resistant (mechanical) watch in production. For obtaining this official <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> the water resistance is tested {{to a depth}} of 7500 m to offer the 25% safety reserve required by the ISO 6425 divers' watches standard.|$|E

To compute this feature, we need at first find out the longest short session in one long session. Then we calculate the maximum log’s depth in this longest short session max(DS) and the longest short session’s total length LShort. This feature describes how the depth pattern of one user’s long session is different from this user’s pattern of the longest short session. This feature is close to zero for crawlers, who have consistent <b>depth</b> <b>rates</b> for their short sessions and long sessions.|$|R

40|$|Two robust {{rate control}} system designs {{are carried out}} for a sub-mersible (modeled by the NSRDC 2510 equations) in a turn using the Linear Quadratic Gaussian {{approach}} with Loop Transfer Recovery. Separate com-mand channels allow the submersible to maneuver independently in the horizontal and vertical planes; the vehicle operator controls the bearing <b>rate</b> and <b>depth</b> <b>rate</b> through a joystick-like device. The fin configuration is the conventional cruciform stern without differential control. The first compensator design, called the r- 6 controller in this thesis, directly controls two vehicle state variables; pitch (6) and the vehicle angular velocity, r, about the z-axis. The other system, called the iji- z controller, controls yaw (or heading) <b>rate</b> (^) and <b>depth</b> <b>rate</b> (z) directly. However, this design relies on linearized equations of yaw and <b>depth</b> <b>rate</b> to be employed by the compensator for state reconstruction.

40|$|Experiments {{examining}} root growth, {{the utilization}} of N {{and the effect of}} green manures were carried out on four vegetable crops. Large differences were observed both in rooting <b>depth</b> penetration <b>rates,</b> and in final rooting depth and distribution. Onion had a very low <b>depth</b> penetration <b>rate,</b> carrot an intermediate rate, and lettuce and cabbage showed high rates. A combination of <b>depth</b> penetration <b>rates</b> and duration of growth determined rooting depth at harvest. Therefore, lettuce, which had a very short growing season, had a shallow root system at harvest, whereas carrot with a lower <b>depth</b> penetration <b>rate</b> but a long growing season had deep rooting at harvest. The final rooting depth of the vegetables varied from approximately 0. 3 m for onion to more than 1. 0 m for carrot and early cabbage. Carrot and cabbage were able to utilize N from deeper soil layers, not available to onion and lettuce. The ability of green manure crops to concentrate available N in the upper soil layers was especially valuable when they were grown before the two shallow rooted crops. ...|$|R
5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} <b>depth</b> and ascent <b>rate</b> of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in <b>depth</b> and <b>rate</b> of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control <b>depth</b> and ascent <b>rate,</b> or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|R

It has set multiple industry records for <b>depth,</b> <b>rate</b> of penetration and directional drilling. On 27 August 2012, Exxon Neftegas Ltd beat its previous record by completing Z-44 Chayvo well. This ERD well reached a measured total depth of 12,376 m, making it the longest well in the world.|$|R
50|$|The Turtle was {{designed}} to dive to 6000 feet. When DSV-2 Alvin installed a new titanium hull, the Alvin steel hull was installed in the Turtle. The Turtle <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> was then increased to 10,000 feet. It has a hull 2 inches thick, and a hatch about 3-1/2 inches thick {{held in place by}} the pressure of the water above it (it is tapered, narrower inward). The Alvin-class DSV's were designed to replace older DSV, such as the less maneuverable Trieste-class bathyscaphes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the dosimetric {{characteristics of a}} low energy photon intra-operative ra-diotherapy (IORT) system and explore its potential limitation in clinical application. Methods: A special water phantom, a parallel-plate ionization chamber and an electrometer were {{used to measure the}} <b>depth</b> dose <b>rate,</b> isotropy of dose distribution in X/Y plane, dosimetry reproducibility of bare probe and spherical applicators of different size which were used in comparison with the system data. Results: The difference in <b>depth</b> dose <b>rate</b> between the measurement and system data for bare probe is − 2. 16 % ± 1. 36 %, the range of the relative deviation for isotropy in the X/Y plane is between − 1. 9 % and 2. 1 %. The difference in <b>depth</b> dose <b>rate,</b> transfer coefficient, isotropy in X/Y plane between the measurement and system data for the whole set of spherical applicators is − 10. 0 %- 2. 3 %, − 8. 9 %- 4. 2 % and − 1. 6 %- 2. 6 %, respectively. Higher surface dose rate and steeper gradient depth dose are observed in smaller spherical applicators.

30|$|Moreover, the {{carbonation}} <b>depth</b> and <b>rate</b> modulus {{obtained from}} the specimens cured under thermo-hydrostatic and wet curing conditions were approximately 10 % of those specimens from the cured under various wind speed and sunlight exposure time. Also, the carbonation <b>depth</b> and <b>rate</b> modulus of the air cured specimens equivalent to a general environmental conditions were approximately 40 % of those from the various curing conditions specimens, with similar trends in the carbonation <b>depth</b> and <b>rate</b> modulus results. In conclusion, the carbonation depth increased as the wind speed and sunlight-exposure time increased. The results demonstrated that carbonation rate modulus decreases as relative humidity increases in the curing process, which {{can be associated with}} in climate conditions of greater wind speed and sunlight-exposure time. From these harsher climate conditions, curing becomes increasingly difficult and porosity in specimens increase, making it easier for carbon dioxide to penetrate faster and deeper. The results suggest that climate factors {{play a major role in}} concrete carbonation resistance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Rolex also {{produced}} {{a small number}} of ref. 6200 Submariners. This was the first Submariner (although not the first Rolex) {{to make use of the}} Mercedes hand set, a feature of all subsequent Submariners. The 6200 also featured an oversized winding crown compared to the 6204 and 6205 models. Within a few years, Rolex revised its Submariner line, producing the 6536 (small crown) and 6538 (oversized crown) models. These watches had [...] "improved" [...] movements (the cal. 1030), including a chronometer version in some 6536 models (designated 6536/1), the now-familiar Mercedes hands, and the Submariner logo and <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> printed on the dial.|$|E
50|$|The {{standards}} for diving watches are {{regulated by the}} ISO 6425 international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water)pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100 metre <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.|$|E
50|$|The {{design and}} actual {{availability}} of divers' watches certified {{for more than}} 1000 m is not explicable solely by practical diving needs.The diving depth record for off-shore (saturation) diving was achieved in 1988 {{by a team of}} professional divers of the Comex S.A., industrial deep-sea diving company performing pipe line connection exercises at a depth of 534 m of seawater (msw/fsw) in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the Hydra 8 programme. In 1992, a Comex diver achieved a record of 701 m of seawater in an on-shore hyperbaric chamber as part of the Hydra 10 programme. A hydrogen-helium-oxygen gas mixture was used as breathing gas. The watches used during this scientific record dives were Rolex Sea-Dwellers with a 1220 m <b>depth</b> <b>rating</b> and these feats were used in advertising.The complexity, medical problems and physiological limits such as those imposed by high pressure nervous syndrome and accompanying high costs of professional saturation diving to extreme depths and the development of deep water atmospheric diving suits and remotely operated underwater vehicles in offshore oilfield drilling and production effectively nixed the need for ever deeper non-atmospheric manned intervention in the ocean.|$|E
