40|$|AbstractA windowedreactor {{prototype}} of internally-circulating fluidized bed is tested and demonstrated at laboratory scale for steam gasification of coal cokeirradiated directly by concentrated Xe {{light from a}} 3 -kWth sun simulator. The bed material is composed of particle mixture of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> and quartz sand. A <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> of the bed material works as a carbonous feedstock, while quartz sand functions as a thermal storage/transfer medium inside the reactor. The fluidized bed reactor, having a transparent window due to incoming radiation of concentrated solar beam on {{the ceiling of the}} reactor, is designed to be combined with a solar reflective tower or beam-down optics. A potential of quartz sand in the internally-circulating fluidized bed reactor is evaluated forsteam gasification of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> by gasification performance (CO, H 2 and CO 2 production rates, carbon conversion, and light-to-chemical efficiency). The gasification performances for use of the particle mixture in the reactor are compared with that for use of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> particle. The fluidized bed of a particle mixtureincluding <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> and quartz sand was gasified at lower temperature with a higher rate in comparison to that of a <b>coal</b> <b>coke.</b> Furthermore, a use of smaller and lighter <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> particles were easily converted to gaseous species due to larger surface area as well as the gasification rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the preparation of small-diameter briquettes {{on the basis of}} desintegrated phyto-materials and the admixture of <b>coal</b> and <b>coke.</b> The phyto-materials are classified as a dry biomass that can be, on the one hand, the wastes from wood-working industry,(sawdust, chips, bark, etc.) or dried mass from the plant production and, on the other hand, the mass of quick-growing plants cultivated on special plantations. In present time this renewable energy resource attracts attention by its heating value ranging from 10 to 16 MJ. kg- 1 (EkoWATT, 2001), a low ash content of 0. 5  6. 5 % and by a low sulphur content in a water free sample of 0. 05  0. 12 %. As a phyto-material the spruce sawdusts having a grain size of  2 mm were used. The admixture of brown <b>coal,</b> <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> and <b>coke</b> with a grain size of 0. 040 mm was added to the sawdust and in such way prepared mixtures were subjected to briquetting with the aim to obtain small-diameter briquettes. The influence of admixtures amount on the density, and the suitable briquetting press have been studied. A saleability of briquettes on the basis of phyto-materials is conditioned by their density that must be higher than 1, 000 kg. m- 3. Thus, an adding of denser material with a relatively high calorific value would enable to attain the required density as well as to retain and/or to improve the main utility properties, i. e. calorific value and ash content. The adding evinces itself in an enhancement of briquetting press, but also density of obtained briquettes is often much higher that required by the market. It was showed {{that in the case of}} clear spruce sawdust the density of 1, 059 kg. m- 3 under the briquetting press of 250 MPa can be attained. According to other results, an admixture of brown coal is not very favourable because briquetting press exceeds the value of 300 MPa. As to <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> adding, the presses under 250 MPa were achieved at the content of 25  30 %. The density of these briquettes ranges from 1, 050  1, 085 kg. m- 3. The best results have been obtained by adding coke. The briquetting press lower than 250 MPa has already been attained at the coke content of 15 %. The further increase of the coke content up to 30 % resulted in the briquetting press of 185 MPa. The density of briquettes with the admixture of coke was from 1, 037 to 1, 063 kg. m- 3...|$|R

40|$|Target costing as {{an element}} of the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> {{extraction}} cost planning process Striving for the efficiency of activities is of great significance in the management of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> extractive enterprises, which are constantly subjected to the process of restructuring. Effective cost management is an important condition of the increase in the efficiency of the researched business entities’ activity. One of the tools whose basic objective is conscious influencing cost levels is target costing. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse the conditions of implementing target costing in the planning of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> extraction costs in <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> mines in Poland. The subject area raises a topical and important problem of the scope of solutions concerning cost analysis in <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> mines in Poland, which has not been thoroughly researched yet. To achieve the abovementioned aim, the theoretical works of the subject area have been referenced. The mine management process is difficult and requires the application of best suited and most modern tools, including those used in the planning process of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> extraction costs in order to support the economic efficiency of mining operations.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of electricity generation in <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> fired power plants varies considerably {{from country to}} country and over time. These differences occur both between developing and developed countries and between industrialised nations. The econometric analysis presented in this paper tests for the reasons of these discrepancies. In this examination abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> and the price of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> are the two variables of our major interest. We assume that countries with an abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> or relatively low costs of extraction show smaller degrees of efficiency than countries with poor deposits of this resource because the latter nations have a stronger dependency on efficient power plants than the former. Furthermore, higher prices should lead to more efficient electricity generation since production costs increase with growing <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> prices. Our findings partially confirm these hypotheses and suggest that, among the chosen explanatory variables, <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> abundance or the accessibility of <b>hard</b> <b>coal,</b> respectively, the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> price, the level of foreign direct investment inflows as well as the average power plant age are identified as principal drivers of power plant efficiency. From an environmental policy perspective we conclude that flexible policy instruments which internalise external effects caused by emissions as well as support for foreign investments are important means to foster energy efficiency. However, economic efficiency - even if contrasting with energy efficiency - must not be neglected in the design of energy policies...|$|R
