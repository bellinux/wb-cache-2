5000|$|Liane Bonin Starr of HitFix gave a {{worrying}} {{reaction to}} the episode, saying:Because this is [...] "Once Upon A TIme," [...] sic I dont know if I accept any character as really and truly dead, um, ever. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>accept</b> any plot twist as irreversible, either. But dammit, [...] "OUAT" [...] has me worried with this midseason finale. Logically, I understand {{there was a need}} for the show to make some big moves. I suspect, given the ending, those big moves wont be as permanent or lasting as earlier scenes led us to believe. But still, I think Kitsis and Horowitz have decided to shake the toy box to mix things up, and I can only hope (Hope! Hey, the theme of the episode!) it portends a fresh storylineone we richly deserve after the claustrophobic Neverland.|$|E

What <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was against the rules." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{believe that}} {{probably}} {{the situation in}} this particular case is the case of a young police officer who overreacted. And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>accept</b> the evidence of Mr. S. that he was told to shut up or he would be under arrest. That seems to be in keeping with the prevalent attitude of the day." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was some}} {{criticism}} {{with regards to}} Pavarotti, a classically-trained opera singer, performing pop songs with pop stars at his charity concerts. Pavarotti responded to the critics saying: [...] "Some say the word pop is a derogatory word to say 'not important' - <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> that. If the word classic is the word to say 'boring,' <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept.</b> There is good and bad music." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that the}} damsel said: [...] "I know not what thou art or whence thou comest who should present thyself {{in such an}} {{extraordinary}} guise as thou art pleased to do, but, certes, thou must be of some very noble strain. Wherefore <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>accept</b> thee for my knight, and I believe that I shall some time have great glory through thee." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> not deceive myself; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>accept</b> the {{slightest}} intimation of hope; I gave her up. And {{then for a}} time regret, remorse, pain, darkness worked their will with me.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{necessarily}} <b>accept</b> {{the findings of}} Lord Hutton.|$|R
60|$|I was silent, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>accept</b> the explanation. And so, when I had the chance, I asked old man Sellers, who browsed {{daily on}} my exchanges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's my affair," [...] I returned, [...] "and if I {{accept the}} {{consequences}} I don't quite see what you've {{to say to}} it. That <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>accept</b> them--so far as I make them out as not too intolerable and you as not intending them to be--that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>accept</b> them is what I've been trying to signify to you. Only my fall," [...] I added, [...] "is an inevitable shock. You remarked to {{me a few minutes}} since that you didn't recover yourself in a flash. I differ from you, you see, in that I do; I take my collapse all at once. Here then I am. I'm smashed. I don't see, as I look about me, a piece I can pick up. I don't attempt to account for my going wrong; I don't attempt to account for yours with me; I don't attempt to account for anything. If Long is just what he always was it settles the matter, and the special clincher for us can be but your honest final impression, made precisely more aware of itself by repentance for the levity with which you had originally yielded to my contagion." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{musician}} Arthur Russell {{had been}} a disciple of Pemchekov Warwick. He joined the Kailas Shugendō in February 1969. Ex-disciple Paul Nagy is more critical, stating [...] " [...] In some of his ex-disciple's minds, Warwick is the classic, crazy false teacher. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>accept</b> him as a teacher, but withdrew from his cult once he tried to position himself as a guru". Nagy gives little more information, but had earlier stated {{that he had been}} directed to Warwick to study Tantric teachings.|$|R
60|$|When I inquired {{who this}} person was he said with his {{unpleasant}} smile that I had better go through the tunnel and see for myself, an invitation which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>accept.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>accept</b> the {{restrictions}} imposed by men, rather accepted only those restrictions which my mind has imposed upon me... I think that saying things {{from behind a}} veil is more appropriate because symbolism and allusion are the beauty of poetry, too.|$|R

50|$|Let me {{pause to}} say that I have long {{regarded}} homosexuality as an abnormality that appears to occur in some people from birth. It is, in that regard, not a choice. Neither, however, is one’s race. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not discriminate against homosexuals, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> the destruction of societal norms because some homosexuals demand it.|$|R

40|$|My {{point of}} {{departure}} {{in this article is}} a conception of science which on various points differs essentially from positivism. Firstly, I believe that every conception of science inherently implies a conception of man. Secondly, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not -regard the acquisition of knowledge as the mere receipt, registration and classification of data and the consequent determination of conformities, regularities, etc., in the empirical data thus processed. Thirdly, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>accept</b> the notion that a sharp dividing line exists between fact and norm. Having said this, I hasten to add that neither <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>accept</b> a natural law doctrine, rationalistic or otherwise. In my view, an essential characteristic of scientific practice is to test theses not only on their mutual compatibility or consistency but also on their empirical tenability. The question is, however, what is understood by experience and by testing...|$|R

60|$|I {{can answer}} for {{the delight of}} the English children; a just and godlike delight.

500|$|Once the {{election}} concludes, the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall.
