40|$|The Mini-Brayton Heat Source Assembly (HSA) {{consists}} of a radioisotope fueled heat source, a heat exchanger, a multifoil thermal insulation blanket, and a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>housing.</b> The thermal insulation blanket is a multilayer wrap of thin metal foil separated by a sparsely coated oxide.

40|$|We {{describe}} a compact, ultra-clean device used to deploy radioactive sources along the vertical {{axis of the}} KamLAND liquid-scintillator neutrino detector for purposes of calibration. The device worked by paying out and reeling in precise lengths of a hanging, small-gauge wire rope (cable); an assortment of interchangeable radioactive sources could be attached to a weight {{at the end of}} the cable. All components exposed to the radiopure liquid scintillator were made of chemically compatible UHV-cleaned materials, primarily stainless steel, in order to avoid contaminating or degrading the scintillator. To prevent radon intrusion, the apparatus was enclosed in a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>housing</b> inside a glove box, and both volumes were regularly flushed with purified nitrogen gas. An infrared camera attached to the side of the housing permitted real-time visual monitoring of the cable׳s motion, and the system was controlled via a graphical user interface...|$|E

40|$|A {{miniaturized}} micro module {{for detecting}} wavelength shifts of light sources as superluminescent diodes is reported. It includes an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder-interferometer with an integrated heater for temperature stabilisation. Beside the integrated optic sensor a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>housing</b> for the chip, the analog electronic for temperature stabilisation and the electronics and {{software for the}} phase measurement were developed. A special fully digital modulation scheme; the so called random phase modulation is used. The sensor can detect fast wavelength shifts in the ppm range. The relative accuracy for the measurements of slow wavelength drifts is limited to 30 ppm by material induced long term drifts in the same range. Applications of the sensor module are fiber bragg interrogation sensors like strain and voltage sensors. (orig.)

40|$|The unique {{features}} and {{applications of the}} presented electrical permanent magnetic bearing system essentially result from three facts: (1) the only bearing rotor components are nonlaminated ferromagnetic steel collars or cylinders; (2) all radial and axial forces are transmitted via radial gaps; and (3) large radial bearing gaps can be provided with minimum electric power consumption. The large gaps allow for effective encapsulation and shielding of the rotors at elevated or low temperatures, corrosive or ultra clean atmosphere or vacuum or high pressure environment. Two significant applications are described: (1) a magnetically suspended x ray rotary anode was operated under high vacuum conditions at 100 KV anode potential, 600 C temperature at the rotor collars and speed 18000 rpm with 13 mm radial bearing gap; and (2) an improved Czochralski type crystal growth apparatus using the hot wall method for pulling GaAs single crystals of low dislocation density. Both crystal and crucible are carried and transported by magnetically suspended shafts inside a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>housing</b> at 800 C shaft and wall temperature.

40|$|Hypothesis: Acoustical {{measurements}} can be {{used for}} functional control of a direct acoustic cochlear stimulator (DACS). Background: The DACS is a recently released active hearing implant that works on the principle of a conventional piston prosthesis driven by the rod of an electromagnetic actuator. An inherent part of the DACS actuator is a thin titanium diaphragm that allows for movement of the stimulation rod while <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealing</b> the <b>housing.</b> In addition to mechanical stimulation, the actuator emits sound into the mastoid cavity because of the motion of the diaphragm. Methods: We investigated the use of the sound emission of a DACS for intra-operative testing. We measured sound emission in the external auditory canal (PEAC) and velocity of the actuators stimulation rod (Vact) in five implanted ears of whole-head specimens. We tested the influence various positions of the loudspeaker and a probe microphone on PEAC and simulated implant malfunction in one example. Results: Sound emission of the DACS with a signal-to-noise ratio > 10 dB was observed between 0. 5 and 5 kHz. Simulated implant misplacement or malfunction could be detected by the absence or shift in the characteristic resonance frequency of the actuator. PEAC changed by < 6 dB for variations of the microphone and loudspeaker position. Conclusion: Our data support the feasibility of acoustical measurements for in situ testing of the DACS implant in the mastoid cavity as well as for post-operative monitoring of actuator function...|$|R
