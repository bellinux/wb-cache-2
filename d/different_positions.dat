5|$|A {{number of}} {{similarity}} solutions to this equation {{have been found}} for various types of flow, including flat plate boundary layers. The term similarity refers to the property that the velocity profiles at <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> in the flow are the same apart from a scaling factor. These solutions are often presented {{in the form of}} non-linear ordinary differential equations.|$|E

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took <b>different</b> <b>positions.</b> Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were {{settling}} in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E

Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.|$|E
5|$|Alston played {{high school}} {{football}} at Warren County High School as a quarterback. He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, Alston {{was used by the}} Pirates coaching staff in tandem with sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback. As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, the Pirates coaching staff tried out Alston at several <b>different</b> <b>positions.</b> After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the position in which he would play out the rest of his college and professional careers. In his final year with the Pirates, Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Kaladze {{became the}} most {{expensive}} Georgian footballer in history when Milan paid €16 million {{to bring him to}} Italy. He cited an injury to Aleksei Gerasimenko as his reason for leaving. At first, Kaladze was tried in <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> and faced competition for places in defense from players such as Jaap Stam and Cafu. In the 2002–03 season, however, he made 46 appearances in all competitions, including 27 Serie A appearances. That year, Milan won the Champions League, where they beat Juventus on penalties in the final (despite Kaladze missing his penalty) and the Coppa Italia, where they beat Roma 6–3 on aggregate in the final. After Kaladze's double success, the Georgian postal service issued a special stamp bearing the player's image. He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} <b>different</b> <b>positions,</b> but in 2007–08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the {{continuity}} helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the last few weeks of the season.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts that these two sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player {{controls}} the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to <b>different</b> <b>positions</b> triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions. The Prince {{can be moved}} in all directions, and {{he is able to}} manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health. During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into her line of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to <b>different</b> <b>positions,</b> for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
5|$|The Twins {{finally won}} the American League pennant during the 1965 season. On July 11, {{the day before}} the All-Star break, {{defending}} AL champion Yankees had a one-run lead over the Twins going {{into the bottom of the}} 9th inning, but Killebrew hit a two-run home run for the win. Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game at his home field, Metropolitan Stadium, and hit a game-tying two-run home run, erasing what had been a 5–0 National League lead. Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three <b>different</b> <b>positions,</b> having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).|$|E
