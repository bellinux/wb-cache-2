One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof. Both {{were found in}} Hawelti. Another depicts a square house with {{what appear to be}} layers of pitched thatch forming the roof.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at latest {{with the}} Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a {{distinct}} Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets {{were found in}} the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.|$|E

Sextus Propertius imagines Helen as a girl who practices arms and hunts with her brothers:* Cairns, Sextus Propertius, 421–422; Hughes, Helen of Troy, 60; Pomeroy, Spartan Women, 28: [...] "In the Roman period, because Sparta was a destination for tourists, the characteristics that made Sparta distinctive were emphasized. The athleticism of women was exaggerated." ...|$|E

Of greater interest to scholars is his historiography, using as it did both Greek and Mesopotamian methods.

2500|$|The {{departure}} of the Arabs of Palestine from towns and villages during April - 15 May 1948 cannot be attributed to any specific reason. Rather, the exodus {{was the result of}} many diverse elements—psychological, military and political—which combined together to produce this phenomena. It was a result of the contradictory actions and reactions which destroyed all hopes in the hearts of the Arab population and urged them to flee aimlessly hither and thither.
