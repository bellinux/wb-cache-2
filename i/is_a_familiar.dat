5|$|The loud goose-like honking call <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> sound, {{particularly}} during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for {{stealing}} food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school.

At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E

25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz clock <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|E

25|$|Sardanapalus' {{attitude}} of calm detachment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> pose in Romantic imagery {{in this period}} in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat {{is about to be}} cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time.|$|E
25|$|While never a noted {{industrial}} suburb, Ashfield has had {{a couple}} of significant industries. On Parramatta Rd near Frederick St was the Australian Six motor car factory which opened in 1920. The site later became an AWA factory producing radio valves and other components. The site has since been turned into a commercial and residential development. On the other side of Frederick St was the Peek Freans biscuit factory, the tower of which was (and still <b>is)</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> site to passing motorists on Parramatta Rd. However, this factory is also no longer industrial, serving today as a large hardware store.|$|E
25|$|The phrase 'bush carpentry' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> Australian usage, {{but finding}} an exact {{description}} of its practice is rare. The Macquarie Dictionary for example, defines a bush carpenter as a rough amateur carpenter, and G. A. Wilkes {{says he is}} a rough and ready carpenter. The Macquarie in turn defines rough-and-ready as rough, rude or crude, but {{good enough for the}} purpose. Wannan says that a bush carpenter is 'a very rough, unorthodox artisan indeed', and includes a sardonic excerpt from Henry Lawson to exemplify it. In his Bushcraft series Ron Edwards describes hut and furniture building, and 'stockcamp architecture', without once using the phrase 'bush carpentry', though 'rough and ready' recurs. Tocal Agricultural College offers a course in 'Traditional bush timber construction'; The word 'traditional' appears six times in the course outline, but not 'bush carpentry'.|$|E

The battalion donates canned food items and toys to annual holiday food and toy drives where it has gained notoriety among the Student Association for amassing large amounts of food for the drive; because of this, the Balboa Battalion sponsors and puts together the food drive each year at Balboa. Balboa's JROTC participates in the citywide beach clean up annually, as well as cleaning up the school campus {{on a regular basis}} several times a month.

500|$|Described {{as one of}} Australia's most {{accomplished}} songbirds, the Australian magpie has an array of complex vocalisations.

Common and widespread, it has adapted well to human habitation and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> bird of parks, gardens and farmland in Australia and New Guinea. This species is commonly fed by households around the country, but in spring {{a small minority of}} breeding magpies (almost always males) become aggressive and swoop and attack those who approach their nests.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of this}} monumental {{inscription}} {{comes from}} Roman classical architecture. The Romans brought Christianity to these islands, along with the custom of engraving stone. The form of the Celtic cross embodies the cross-fertilisation of indigenous and Roman cultures, from which the Welsh nation first emerged. The monumental inscription <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> feature of Roman architecture. The inscription over {{the entrance of the}} Wales Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition, and also a recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation. We're lucky to have two languages; one that we share with half the world and one which belongs just to us. Words in songs, stories and poems have helped to make Wales the proud country that it is. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|Cordelia's {{representation}} of an assertive modern {{woman and her}} character arc in Buffy has been commented on in several academic texts, particularly in gender studies, such as [...] "Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls", or [...] In the latter, Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia's initial place in the series where [...] "At first glance, Cordelia {{seems to have the}} 'normal life' Buffy often longs for. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Furthermore, Cordelia's exceptionalism is based on 'real' material privilege rather than supernatural power. She represents in more exaggerated form the unnamed white middle-class heterosexual qualities (read privilege) of the other characters (to the point that it becomes visible)." [...] Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia's status is highlighted by her nickname, [...] "Queen C", and Harmony's remark to her, [...] "Cordy, you reign." [...] Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters." ...|$|E
