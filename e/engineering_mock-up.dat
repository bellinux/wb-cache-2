50|$|On June 21, 2013 Blackburn news {{reported}} that the full scale <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-up</b> of the Canadian Arrow rocket was purchased by Sarnia Ontario's Preferred Towing. Having spent several years at Chris Hatfield Airport in Sarnia, Ontario, Preferred Towing expressed interest in hopes of restoring the rocket for display in Sarnia. This plan has since been scrapped and the mock-up no longer exists.|$|E
5000|$|All {{through the}} {{construction}} process, {{representatives of the}} RCAF check the <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-up</b> {{as well as the}} first prototype Argus (coded VN-710) to ensure that the finished product meets their needs. When the prototype emerges from the assembly bay on day 175, it is newly christened as the [...] "Argus". Company test pilots successfully carry out the maiden flight, the start of a lengthy period of testing. After years of planning, design and construction, the first Argus (20710) is accepted by the RCAF.|$|E
25|$|As such, Hawker {{elected to}} refine the P.1040 design while it {{remained}} as a private venture, albeit being prepared with a view for service with British military customers in mind. In October 1945, Sydney Camm, Hawker's chief designer, being satisfied with the results generated from <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-ups</b> and wind tunnel testing, authorised the raising of a production order for a single prototype by the company's experimental department. In light of the diminished RAF interest in the project, allegedly due to the aircraft offering insufficient advances over the jet fighters that were already in service, such as the Gloster Meteor and de Havilland Vampire; in January 1946, a navalised version of the P.1040 was offered by Hawker to the Admiralty as a fleet support fighter, designated as the P.1046.|$|R
500|$|After {{evaluating}} the <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-ups</b> and the full-scale wooden mock-up in February 1956, the RCAF demanded additional changes, selecting the advanced RCA-Victor Astra fire-control system firing the equally advanced United States Navy Sparrow II {{in place of}} the MX-1179 and Falcon combination. Avro vocally objected on the grounds that neither of these were even in testing at that point, whereas both the MX-1179 and Falcon were almost ready for production and would have been nearly as effective for [...] "a very large saving in cost". [...] The Astra proved to be problematic as the system ran into a lengthy period of delays, and when the USN cancelled the Sparrow II in 1956, Canadair was quickly brought in to continue the Sparrow program in Canada, although they expressed grave concerns about the project as well and the move added yet more expense.|$|R
40|$|Co-Simulation is {{a rather}} general {{approach}} to the simulation of coupled technical systems and coupled physical phenomena in <b>engineering.</b> The Functional <b>Mock-up</b> Interface (FMI) for co-simulation provides interfaces between master and slaves as a standard for the coupling {{of two or more}} simulators. The interfaces address both data exchange issues and algorithmic issues. The paper presents the interface definition in terms of the programming language C as well as issues of application. The interface is defined to support both simple and more sophisticated master algorithms. This is a joint work supported by the German BMBF within the ITEA 2 project MODELISAR...|$|R
50|$|A {{full-size}} <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-up</b> of the Baikal was {{exhibited at}} the Paris Air Show in July 2001. Similar mockups were tested in wind tunnels of the Central Aero- and Hydrodynamics Institute TsAGI, at speeds of 0.5 - 10 Mach. However, according to unofficial statements by Khrunichev Center representatives, {{there would have been}} a long development program to the production of models for captive tests, and the mock-up demonstrated at Le Bourget differs greatly in appearance and design from the Baikal that will actually be launched.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a "change'n play" software architecture {{in order to}} realize user-centric aspects for, integrated engineering analysis tasks within immersive environments. The proposed architecture {{has been designed to}} enable conceptual simulations performed on an <b>engineering</b> <b>mock-up.</b> Major attention is given to the realization of modules and functionalities going far beyond traditional post-processing capabilities, establishing a user centric problem solving environment. It allows closed turnaround simulation-to-visualization loops as well as an inclusion of traditional point-and-click legacy systems, steered from an immersive environment and providing interchangeable mechanism. Existing research work addresses only different aspects, even worse neither does provide a holistic approach nor does show on how to actually do it. Aim of this paper is therefore, to propose and develop an architectural blueprint, supporting "what-if" reasoning with respect to preliminary design analysis objectives: Executed within one single point of access and based on a distributed, hybrid 2 D legacy system/VR interactive environment...|$|E
