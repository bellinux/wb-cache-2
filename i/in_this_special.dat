25|$|While the S-matrix may {{be defined}} for any {{background}} (spacetime) that is asymptotically solvable and has no event horizons, it has a simple form {{in the case of}} the Minkowski space. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> case, the Hilbert space is a space of irreducible unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group (the Poincaré group); the S-matrix is the evolution operator between time equal to minus infinity (the distant past), and time equal to plus infinity (the distant future). It is defined only in the limit of zero energy density (or infinite particle separation distance).|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} figure, the two {{orthogonal}} components {{have the same}} amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90° ahead of the y component {{or it can be}} 90° behind the y component. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization. The rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the two phase relationships exists and corresponds to right-hand circular polarization and left-hand circular polarization.|$|E

25|$|This ritual {{assemblies}} {{lay in a}} vase {{that had}} a very anomalous shape to the Precucuteni style and were full of soil and straw. The cultic objects were put on display and worshiped during magic-religious ceremonies. The repeated use of them is proven {{by the presence of}} some chipping from wear. When not in motion, they were probably stored <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> container. The presence of soil under some statuettes kept in the vase, and the evidence of cariossids on the surface of two figurines and four stools, led some researchers to hypothesize that the pieces had been deposited in soil and straw for magical purposes: they had been left to bud.|$|E
25|$|Stage 3 of {{the series}} {{took place in a}} {{conventional}} TV studio. The 50 contestants were split into five groups of ten, each of whom sang one song for the judges, accompanied only by a piano. Each judge offered their opinion, {{and at the end of}} the pre-recorded show phone lines opened for votes. Later the same evening a live show followed in which the voting results were revealed, the top two earning a place in the final ten. In series 2, a wildcard round (an innovation that originated on American Idol) was added, in which the judges selected ten rejected contestants and gave them a second chance. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> edition, one contestant, Susanne Manning, was selected by the viewer vote, and one, Sam Nixon, was chosen by the judges. This meant that the next stage began with twelve contestants, rather than the ten in series 1.|$|E
25|$|Under these circumstances, {{later that}} year, Marius was triumphantly elected consul for 107 BC. He was campaigning against Metellus's {{apparent}} lack of swift action against Jugurtha. Because of the repeated military debacles from 113 BC to 109 BC and the accusations that the oligarchy was open to flagrant bribery, it became easier for the virtuous new man {{who had worked with}} difficulty up the ladder of offices to be elected {{as an alternative to the}} inept or corrupt nobility. The Senate had a trick up its sleeve, however. In accordance with the provisions of the Lex Sempronia on Consular provinces, which dictated that the Senate in a given year was to determine the Consular provinces for the next year at the end of year before the elections, the Senate decided not to make the war against Jugurtha one of the provinces and to prorogue Metellus in Numidia. Marius got around this through a ploy that had been used in 131 BC. In that year there was a dispute as to who should command the war against Aristonicus in Asia, and a tribune had passed a law authorizing an election to select the commander (there was precedent for this procedure from the Second Punic War). A similar law was passed in 108 BC and Marius was voted the command by the People <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> election. Metellus shed bitter tears when he learned of the decision. Upon returning home, he avoided meeting Marius, and was granted a Triumph and the agnomen Numidicus (conqueror of Numidia).|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1930s, {{representatives from}} Lancashire County Cricket Club twice {{approached}} Constantine {{with a view}} to him joining the club—his time in Nelson meant that he qualified to play for Lancashire, having lived in the county for the required time. There was a precedent for such a course, as the Australian Ted McDonald had joined Lancashire after playing as Nelson's professional in the 1920s. In the case of Constantine nothing happened, as members of the Lancashire Board and, later, players in the team opposed the idea of a black man playing for the county. In any case Constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was the negativity and dullness of county cricket. He found the standard of play very high, stating: [...] "Never in my life have I played harder than in Lancashire." [...] In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting, but: [...] "it was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> atmosphere of League cricket that Constantine was supreme." ...|$|E

Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E

In his introductory note, Davies cites as examples of the Doctor's previous associations with music: the First Doctor disguising himself as Ancient Rome's most famous lyre-player in Emperor Nero's court in The Romans; the Second Doctor playing his recorder; the Third Doctor singing Aggedor to sleep with a Venusian lullaby in The Curse of Peladon; the Fourth Doctor shattering glass by singing {{in the style of}} Dame Nellie Melba in The Power of Kroll; the Fifth Doctor playing a harp on Gallifrey in The Five Doctors; the Sixth Doctor singing opera; the Seventh Doctor playing the spoons; the Eighth Doctor admiring composer Giacomo Puccini; and the Ninth Doctor dancing with Rose Tyler to [...] "In The Mood" [...] by Glenn Miller in [...] "The Doctor Dances". In writing the episode, Davies expressed hope that [...] "this mini-adventure [...] that music can take any shape or form, whether it’s singing, or playing the recorder, or even the spoons." [...] He states that [...] "music can go anywhere, reach anyone, and make better people of us all. Just like the Doctor." ...|$|E
