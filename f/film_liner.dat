Using the matched pairs approach, the houses were divided into three study groups of four houses each. Comparative data was recorded for each house to evaluate sub-metered heat pump energy consumption, relative humidity, wood moisture content, duct infiltration, house infiltration, temperature, radon, and bioaerosol levels. Findings indicated that in the humid conditions of the southeastern United States, a properly closed crawl space is a robust construction measure that produces a substantially drier crawl space and significantly reduces occupied space conditioning energy use on an annual basis...|$|E

40|$|The gap-fill {{performance}} and process of perhydropolysilazane-based inorganic spin-on dielectric (PSZ-SOD) film in shallow trench isolation (STI) with the ultra-low dispensation amount of PSZ-SOD solution {{have been investigated}} in this study. A PSZ-SOD <b>film</b> process includes <b>liner</b> deposition, PSZ-SOD coating, and furnace curing. For liner deposition, hydrophilic property is required to improve the contact angle and gap-fill capability of PSZ-SOD coating. Prior to PSZ-SOD coating, the additional treatment on liner surface is beneficial for the fluidity of PSZ-SOD solution. The superior film thickness uniformity and gap-fill performance of PSZ-SOD film are achieved due to the improved fluidity of PSZ-SOD solution. Following that up, the low dispensation rate of PSZ-SOD solution leads to more PSZ-SOD filling in the trenches. After PSZ-SOD coating, high thermal curing process efficiently promotes PSZ-SOD film conversion into silicon oxide. Adequate conversion from PSZ-SOD into silicon oxide further increases the etching resistance inside the trenches. Integrating the above sequence of optimized factors, void-free gap-fill and well-controlled STI recess uniformity are achieved even when the PSZ-SOD solution dispensation volume is reduced 3 to 6 times compared with conventional condition for the 28 [*]nm node NAND flash and beyond...|$|R

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is an important}} source of hydrocarbon and particulate emissions in modem automobile engines. Great efforts have been made by automotive manufacturers to minimize the impact of {{oil consumption}} on engine emissions. Research engineers in the last decade have been trying to study the sources and driving mechanism of oil consumption. In contrast to oil consumption mechanisms in the piston-ring-liner system of the engine, the Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) blowby-oil consumption mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Studies have shown that the blowby contribution to oil consumption could be significant under certain conditions. In this study, an experimental approach was taken in order to study the sources and characteristics of oil in the PCV blowby gases at different speeds and loads. An extensive diagnostic system was successfully integrated in a production spark ignition engine, to measure total oil consumption, blowby oil consumption and flow and in-cylinder variables, such as inter-ring pressures, oil <b>film</b> thickness and <b>liner</b> temperatures. Results showed an increase in blowby oil consumption with load and speed. Blowby flow was mainly dependent on the load of the engine. Oil concentration in the blowby varied with engine operating conditions. A strong relationship was observed between oil consumption and sump oil level, showing that the oil in the crankcase is {{an important source of}} oil in the blowby. Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to determine the blowby flow's oil characteristics, by varying the liner temperatures and analyzing the mass distribution of different oil particle size. It was found that the average oil droplet size decreased as the load and speed were increased. (cont.)

40|$|Gas turbine {{combustor}} design {{represents an}} ambitious task in numerical and experimental analysis. A {{significant number of}} competing criteria must be optimised within specified constraints {{in order to satisfy}} legislative and performance requirements. Currently, preliminary combustor flow and heat transfer design procedures, which by necessity involve semi-empirical models, are often restricted in their range of application. The objective of this work is the development of a versatile design tool able to model all conceivable gas turbine combustor types. A network approach provides the foundation for a complete flow and heat transfer analysis to meet this goal. The network method divides the combustor into a number of independent interconnected sub-flows. A pressure-correction methodology solves the continuity equation and a pressure-drop/flow-rate relationship. A constrained equilibrium calculation, incorporating mixing and recirculation models, simulates the combustion process. The new procedures are validated against numerical and experimental data within three annular combustors and one reverse flow combustor. A full conjugate heat transfer model is developed to allow the calculation of liner wall temperature characteristics. The effects of conduction, convection and radiation are included in the model. <b>Film</b> cooling and <b>liner</b> heat pick-up effects are included in the convection calculation. Radiation represents the most difficult mode of heat transfer to simulate in the combustion environment. A discrete transfer radiation model is developed and validated for use within the network solver. The effects of soot concentration on radiation is evaluated with the introduction of radial properties profiles. The accuracy of the heat transfer models are evaluated with comparisons to experimental thermal paint temperature data on a reverse flow and annular combustors.

40|$|Soot {{mediated}} oil thickening, normally {{referred to}} asoilsoot, {{is a well}} known problem that can cause increased wearon lubricated moving or rubbing components in diesel engines. The ambition of this thesis is to understand the mechanisms ofcombustion and soot formation that {{pave the way for}} thisproblem and use this knowledge in the development of apredictive model for soot contamination of the oil. Anadditional task, however, is the use of Computational FluidDynamics (CFD) as the platform for development of the oilsootmodel. A preliminary hypothesis for soot contamination of the oilis formulated from a combination of theoretical reasoning andprevious experimental evaluations. This states that the oilsootgrowth rate is the result of particle deposition in the oilfilm on the cylinder liner, followed by scraping ofcontaminated oil to the crank case by the piston rings. Acontrolling factor here is assumed to be thermophoresis, whichhas been identified in the past as the dominating particletransport mechanism within the viscous sublayer at combustionchamber surfaces and hence governs the rate of particledeposition in the oil <b>film</b> on the <b>liner.</b> A thermophoretic particle deposition model is suggested forthe calculation of soot deposition on the liner from local sootdistribution as predicted by the standard CFD code. The modelis evaluated through parameter studies comprising the influenceof injection timing, liner temperature, topland height,injected fuel quantity, equivalence ratio, boost pressure andspeed, and the agreement between simulations and measurementsis generally good. It is concluded that the peak in-cylindersoot concentration is more important to oilsoot growth than theexhaust soot level. Moreover, changes in in-cylinder sootdistribution has strong effect on soot mediated oil thickening. Consequently, an important practical guideline to reduce sootmediated oil thickening is to end injection 9 ̆ 3 ontime 9 ̆ 4, i. e. before the spray guided diffusion flame isdirected into the squish region rather than into the pistonbowl.
