5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|As {{with nearly}} all primates, strepsirrhines {{typically}} reside in tropical rainforests. These habitats allow strepsirrhines and other primates to evolve diverse communities of sympatric species. In the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, {{as many as}} 11 or 12species share the same forests, and prior to human arrival, some forests had nearly double that diversity. Several species of lemur are found in drier, seasonal forests, including the spiny <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> {{the southern tip of}} the island, although the lemur communities in these regions are not as rich.|$|E

5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted}} to a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake <b>Forest.</b> <b>On</b> 17April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|In the Upper Myall River region, B.serrata {{grows in}} dry sclerophyll <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> sandy soils that have {{recently}} formed (in the Holocene) or in shallow soils over differing substrates, while its close relative B.aemula grows on dry heath forest that occurs on ancient Pleistocene sands {{that have not}} been disturbed in 125,000 years.

5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> calcareous soil.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{pregnant}} {{when she decided}} to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> 17May 1395. Her horse tripped, threw her and landed on top of her. The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son. The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The gorge {{has over}} 225species of wildflowers, plants and trees, with {{scattered}} stands of old growth <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> {{some of its}} steepest walls. The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old. Since clearcutting, nearly 90percent of the forest land has burnt at least once. Typical south-facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees, while north-facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods. Large chestnuts and black cherry can also be found.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, {{is a common}} activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> a hill.|$|E

5|$|With {{new players}} and using Chapman's system, Huddersfield were transformed. They {{finished}} third in 1922–23 {{and went on to}} win their first League title in 1923–24. This success was by the narrowest of margins – equal on points with Cardiff City, Huddersfield won by a difference of 0.024 (1.818 to 1.794) in goal average. The final goal by Brown in a 3–0 win over Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> {{the final day of the}} season proved crucial, although ultimately it was Huddersfield's superior defensive record which had given them the advantage.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a <b>forest</b> <b>on</b> the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} first three matches of the 1906–07 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4–0 home win over Burton United, {{and went on to}} score three more goals in his next four appearances, {{including}} a late winner away at Leeds City. However, the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward Soldier Wilson had died after collapsing during the match. Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906–07, his highest return in a single season. His performances for Burnley led to a call-up from the England amateur team in April 1907, and he won his first cap in the 8–1 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague. In the match, he played alongside full England internationals Harold Hardman and Vivian Woodward, who, like Bell, was a professional architect.|$|E

5|$|After the 1954 World Cup, the {{selection}} committee resumed their duties, continuing until {{the appointment of}} Matt Busby in 1958. Busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to the serious injuries he sustained in the Munich air disaster, with Dawson Walker taking charge of the team while Busby recovered. Busby only took charge of two Scotland matches, but he did give a young Denis Law his first Scotland cap. In March 1959, Andy Beattie became Scotland manager for a second time. During his second spell as Scotland manager, Beattie combined those duties with managing a football club. He resigned in November 1960 in order to manage English club Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> a full-time basis.|$|E
5|$|Although not yet ordained, Gerard {{was rewarded}} with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his {{ordination}} as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of St Paul's Cathedral in London on 9 June 1096. He {{may have been a}} member of the hunting party in the New <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> 2 August 1100 when Rufus was killed, as he witnessed King Henry I's coronation charter– now known as the Charter of Liberties– three days later at Winchester, close by the New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry's coronation that same day, along with Maurice, Bishop of London. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{division}} {{between east and}} west Wessex continued to be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood <b>Forest</b> <b>on</b> the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.|$|E
