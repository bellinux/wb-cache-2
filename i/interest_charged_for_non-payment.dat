40|$|The credit {{crisis of}} 2007 - 2009 can be partly {{explained}} by the perverse incentives provided by both income and tax policies. Income policies {{have been designed to}} address the principal-agent problem but have ended up giving a strong incentive to maximize short term profits. Combined with asymetric pay-off structures, it led to risk-lover behaviors that turned to be detrimental to the organizations and their stakeholders. Tax policies have promoted indebtness through the tax deductibility of <b>interest</b> <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> coroporations and of mortgage for households. Differences in tax treatment have also led to the substitution of more lightly taxed stock options and capital gains to regular remunerations.

50|$|This is {{a special}} {{combination}} of a purchase and a loan. The seller gives the buyer the good or item as normal, but the buyer pays the seller using a credit card. In this way, the buyer is paying with a loan from the credit card company, usually a bank. The bank or other financial institution issues credit cards to buyers that allow any number of loans {{up to a certain}} cumulative amount. Repayment terms for credit card loans, or debts vary, but the interest is often extremely high. An example of common repayment terms would be a minimum payment of the greater of $10 or 3% every month and a 15-20% <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> any unpaid loan amount.

40|$|Payday advance outlets are the sweatshops of {{the lending}} industry. These {{businesses}} <b>charge</b> high fees <b>for</b> cash advances {{that must be}} repaid in full by the borrower's next payday. When calculated as an annual percentage rate, the <b>interest</b> <b>charged</b> <b>for</b> a two-week loan typically exceeds 400 %.

But this working paper examines a second method of sweating borrowers that has received less attention from critics of the industry. Since payday loans are advanced to wage-earners who run short of cash before payday, one might assume that each wage-earner would only be allowed to secure one payday loan at a time and for an amount less than the borrower's take-home pay. Mortgage lenders, after all, must assess a borrower's ability to pay and are not supposed to make loans regardless of other mortgage liabilities and in excess of an applicant's monthly income.

The emergence of cost of loan capital (as a moderating variable) introducing borrowed funds improved the explanatory power to 38. 1 %.
