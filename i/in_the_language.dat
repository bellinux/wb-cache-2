5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style.

In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.

The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics.

5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> of thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
