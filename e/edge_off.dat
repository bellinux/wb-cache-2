5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Edge against Batista in a Steel Cage {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, which could be won by pinfall, submission, or {{escaping}} the cage. During {{the first few minutes}} of the contest, Edge attempted to escape the cage many times but Batista stopped him and gained the advantage after a suplex to <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> the top rope. Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest, performing a spear to Batista, but didn't get the pinfall. Batista regained the advantage and attempted the Batista Bomb, but Edge reversed the move. Edge climbed {{over the top of the}} cage while Batista crawled towards the door. Edge's feet hit the arena floor first, and he was declared the winner and retained his title.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric <b>edge</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the August 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Vince McMahon officially {{announced}} Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky on the August 8 Raw. Seconds after the victory, Hardy {{was attacked by}} Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge in the locker room. On August 21 at SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto {{the top of a}} ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued fighting on Raw, including a Street Fight that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below. At Unforgiven, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg-drop {{off the top of the}} cage. Hardy and Edge faced each other at WWE Homecoming in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match. Edge's briefcase holding his Money in the Bank Contract for his WWE Championship opportunity was suspended above the ring. The winner of the match received the contract and the loser was forced to leave Raw. After a contentious match, Edge tied Hardy's arms in the ropes, and Lita trapped Hardy in a crucifix hold, leaving Hardy only able to watch Edge win. When the match ended, Edge and Lita gloated over the victory, but Hardy took it in stride and left the arena.|$|E
5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that it was because of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E

25|$|A left-handed batsman {{has more}} {{difficulty}} facing off break bowling, because the ball {{moves away from}} his body. This means that any miscalculation can more easily result in an outside <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A ball bowled by a left-arm orthodox spin bowler with an off break action spins in the opposite direction. Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a left-arm orthodox spinner.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, {{started off with}} a maiden over to Trescothick, and England {{struggled}} {{to get off the}} mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps â€“ England were six for three, and staring down the barrel.|$|E
25|$|He missed {{only one}} other Test in his career, that being the fourth Test of the 1932-33 Bodyline series. In the notorious third Test at Adelaide, the English Bodyline tactic of bowling fast balls {{directed}} at the Australian batsmen's bodies reached its most dramatic moment when fast bowler Harold Larwood hit Oldfield in the head, fracturing his skull (although this was from a top <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> a traditional non-Bodyline ball and Oldfield admitted it was his fault). Oldfield was carried from the ground unconscious. He recovered {{in time for the}} fifth Test of the series.|$|E

25|$|Some fielding {{positions}} are used offensively. That is, players are put {{there with the}} main aim being to catch out the batsman rather than to stop or slow down the scoring of runs. These positions include Slip (often there are multiple slips next to each other, designated First slip, Second slip, Third slip, etc., numbered outwards from the wicket-keeperâ€”collectively known as the slips cordon) meant to catch balls that just <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the bat; Gully; Fly slip; Leg slip; Leg gully; the short and silly positions. Short leg, also known as bat pad, is a position specifically intended to catch balls that unintentionally strike the bat and leg pad, and thus end up only a metre or two to the leg side.|$|E
25|$|In December 2001, CVW-14 {{participated in}} Operation Northern <b>Edge</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast of}} {{southern}} Alaska, honing their skills in final preparations for the 2002â€“2003 deployment. CVW-14 deployed aboard USS Abraham Lincoln again on 22 July 2002, supporting both on Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. This marked the first carrier deployment for the multi-mission F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. In the first 17 days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, CVW-14 aircraft dropped more than 1.3 million pounds of ordnance {{in support of the}} war. Prior to returning home, President George W. Bush made his historic landing on the deck of USS Abraham Lincoln in a S-3 piloted by CVW-14's own VS-35 Blue Wolves. This marked the first time a sitting President landed on a carrier in a fixed-wing aircraft and the first time a United States Navy aircraft radio callsign was changed to Navy One. CVW-14 returned home 6 May 2003 after nearly 10 months on deployment, the longest for a carrier in three decades.|$|E
25|$|Adam Gilchrist, Simon Katich and Shane Warne all {{played a}} part in getting Australia past 100, with their scores in the 20s, but Harmison â€“ coming back for a second spell â€“ wrapped them up with {{variations}} in length along with his ever-reliant pace. He finished with five for 43, allowing Glenn McGrath to be stranded on 10 not out, and McGrath was to take centre stage when England batted. They survived six overs until tea, scoring ten runs, but McGrath, who bowled his usual accurate line and length and got the odd ball to move, reaped massive rewards. Marcus Trescothick fell first ball after tea, edging to slip, and Strauss fell in similar fashion three balls later. Michael Vaughan and Ian Bell were shaken up, but survived six overs â€“ before McGrath started the torture again. They were both bowled, as was Andrew Flintoff, and England had lost five wickets for 21 runs, with five of their front line batsmen out in single figures. However, Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones gave England a glimmer of hope, pairing up for 58 before Brett Lee's reverse-swing with the old ball induced a backward <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Jones' bat to Adam Gilchrist. Ashley Giles hit two quick boundaries, but a short pacy ball from Lee undid him, and England were 92 for 7 overnight â€“ needing 98 for the last three wickets to get level with Australia.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss and captain Andrew Strauss {{chose to}} bat on a pitch quite uncharacteristic {{of what would}} be {{considered}} normal at The Oval. Although they lost Alastair Cook to an outside <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Peter Siddle early in the innings, England recovered to reach 108/1 at lunch, with Strauss making his fifty in just 89 balls. However, the captain put on just five more after the break before being caught behind by wicket-keeper Brad Haddin. The next two wickets fell to Siddle in relatively quick succession: Paul Collingwood was caught at mid-on by Michael Hussey, before Ian Bell â€“ who had reached his half-century off 73 balls â€“ inside-edged onto his own stumps for 72. In came debutant Jonathan Trott, who took 12 balls to open his Test scoring tally, and continued to score slowly as he lost partners in Matt Prior and Andrew Flintoff, who made just seven runs in the first innings of his final Test match to take England to 247/6. Trott himself was next to fall, run out by Simon Katich: Trott clipped the ball to the leg side, but Katich made a smart stop and, with just one to aim at, threw the ball at the stumps, catching Trott well out of his ground. The eighth wicket stood for another 39 runs, when Graeme Swann was caught behind off Siddle for the Australian's fourth wicket of the innings, and with that play was closed for the day with England at 307/8.|$|E

After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken the <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years."

500|$|While {{flying back}} from New York, A.B. Quintanillaâ€”the brother-producer of Selenaâ€”heard the Pretenders' 1983 single [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] on the radio. At the time, A.B. {{was having a}} nervous {{breakdown}} after realizing he {{was running out of}} materials to record for Selena's fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). He likened the idea of reworking [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] into a Spanish-language cumbia song. Keyboardist of the group, Ricky Vela wrote the Spanish lyrics into a cumbia-style that A.B. envisioned for the recording. The Amor Prohibido album was pressed for a release date of March 13, 1994, and was halted for distribution due to the copyrighting issues with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Vela retold in a 2002 interview how he was awaken by Selena and A.B. because they did not have the clearance for [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Singer-songwriter Chrissie Hynde's music producers reported the song to Hynde who did not allow Selena to continue with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] until she received an English-language writing of the song. It was only after Vela re-wrote the song into English that Hynde gave Selena the clearance for the recording. Musicologist James Perone, noticed how the song was the shortest track off of Amor Prohibido.
