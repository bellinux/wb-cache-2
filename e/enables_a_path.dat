In this paper, we study the algorithmic issues on path cooperative games {{that arise from}} the situations where some commodity flows through a network. In these games, a coalition of edges or vertices is successful if it <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> from the source to the sink in the network, and lose otherwise. Based on dual theory of linear programming and the relationship with flow games, we provide the characterizations on the CS-core, least-core and nucleolus of path cooperative games.

The tetramethylammonium (TMA) hexatantalate salt (TMA 6 [H 2 Ta 6 O 19]) yields dense Ta 2 O 5 films (~ 95 % of the bulk ß-Ta 2 O 5 density) with atomically smooth surfaces (< 4 Å root mean square surface roughness). This same precursor produces single-digit-nanometer thick films at low solution concentrations. The diprotonated cluster TMA 6 [H 2 Ta 6 O 19] cluster produces films much {{different from those of}} the triprotonated analog TMA 5 [H 3 Nb 6 O 19]. One additional proton in [H 3 Nb 6 O 19] 5 - yields rougher Nb 2 O 5 films with nanoparticles at the surface. A temperature-programmed desorption study of TMA 6 [H 2 Ta 6 O 19] elucidates the reaction pathway of precursor to solid oxide.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTV-MPC) using a sparse clothoid-based path description: a LTV-MPCC. Clothoids are used world-wide in road design since they allow smooth driving associated with low jerk values. The {{formulation of the}} MPC controller {{is based on the}} fact that the path of a vehicle traveling at low speeds defines a segment of clothoids if the steering angle is chosen to vary piecewise linearly. Therefore, we can compute the vehicle motion as clothoid parameters and translate them to vehicle inputs. We present simulation results that demonstrate the ability of the controller to produce a very comfortable and smooth driving while maintaining a tracking accuracy comparable to that of a regular LTV-MPC. While the regular MPC controllers use path descriptions where waypoints are close to each other, our LTV-MPCC has the ability of using paths described by very sparse waypoints. In this case, each pair of waypoints describes a clothoid segment and the cost function minimization is performed in a more efficient way allowing larger prediction distances to be used. This paper also {{presents a}} novel algorithm that addresses the problem of path sparsification using a reduced number of clothoid segments. The path sparsification <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> description using few waypoints with almost no loss of detail. The detail of the reconstruction is an adjustable parameter of the algorithm. The higher the required detail, the more clothoid segments are used. QC 20150826 </p...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} approach for creating miniature Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's) {{has been developed}} using folded MEMS fabrication. This <b>enables</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> toward a high-performance IMU with a chip-scale footprint of < 1 cm^ 2. The explored method of manufacturing chip-scale IMUs utilizes folded MEMS structures rather than chip stacking or single-die implementations. Inertial measurement units have previously been developed to detect translational and rotational motion, and miniaturization of such technology is desired for many applications. A fabrication process is developed in this work for creating chip-level IMU's utilizing a 3 -D SOI backbone which is suitable for high-performance single-axis sensors with an overall package volume of 1 cm^ 3 or less. Inertial sensor test structures are designed and implemented on prototype IMU structures. Conventional packaging methods are used such as wirebonding and flip-chip die attachment to connect the sensor bond pads to the overall package. Results indicate that the scale factors {{are found to be}} 0. 43 mV/°s for the gyroscopes and 3. 7 Hz/g for the accelerometers. Methods for providing reinforcement of the folded MEMS devices are explored including epoxy bonding, eutectic soldering, and silicon welding. Folded structures reinforced with silicon welding resulted in survival of up to 260 g of acceleration and experienced its first modes of resonance above 10 kHz. Performance estimation of the capabilities of the folded MEMS IMU devices is simulated with a mathematical error model. A coordinate transformation is defined to translate the inertial sensor vector axes to navigational frame coordinates. Transformations from the IMU body frame to the navigational frame are created for pyramidal and cubic folded IMU structures. The resulting calculated CEP rate values indicate that the device is capable of moderate navigational performance compared to current technology. This type of IMU shows an overall performance advantage compared to existing chip-scale IMU devices, and is capable of producing a moderate-performance chip-scale device that exceeds the currently available technology...|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} apprenticeship framework's {{purpose was}} to provide a supply of young people seeking to enter work-based learning via apprenticeships by offering structured high-value learning and transferable skills and knowledge. Apprenticeship training was enabled by linking industry with local technical colleges and professional engineering institutions. The apprenticeship framework offered a clear pathway and competency outcomes that addressed the issues facing the industry sector and specific companies. This system was in place since the 1950s. The system provided young people with an alternative to staying in full-time education post- 16/18 to gain purely academic qualifications without work-based learning. The apprenticeship system of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s provided the necessary preparation for young people to qualify as a Craft trade (Machinist, Toolmaker, Fitter, Plumber, Welder, Mechanic, Millwright etc.), or Technician (quality inspector, draughtsman, designer, planner, work study, programmer), or Technician Engineer (tool design, product design, methods, stress and structural analysis, machine design etc.) and even <b>enabled</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> to <b>a</b> fully qualified Chartered Engineer in a specific discipline (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Aeronautical, Chemical, Building, Structural, Manufacturing etc.).

40|$|Art {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{universal}} and oldest human activities; it is a human impulse rather than a skill. The invention of art and language occurred about 30, 000 to 70, 000 years ago. This “cognitive revolution”, going from homo sapiens to homo sapien sapiens, gave us the imaginative powers of language and art. No society as far as we know of thus far has been able to live without some form of art. Yet its exact definition is hard to jot down, much less explain. Art’s constant movement, transformations, its disappearances/reappearances, and even its proclaimed “death” throughout history has always challenged the theorists’ and aesthetes’ attempts to capture art’s essence. But art, at is most basic and cruel form, is still just a human expression upon a surface- any surface; a Lebenswelt captured in a Leinwand, that materializes such abstract human expressions into non-superficial and substantive narratives. With graffiti for example, which will be the main focus of this study, both the message and the surface that graffito is painted upon happen to be non-superficial and highly consequential, since graffiti’s own narrative rests upon the socio-political narrative of contemporary property relations and a capitalist mode of production. ^ Thus, all art forms, especially graffiti art, which is always at risk of being “buffed” by anti-graffiti state programs, are infinitely fleeting and in a state of becoming rather than in a state of being. Therefore, graffiti art must be seen as an open and never totalized process. This infinitely fleeting constitution of graffiti will enable us to understand the movement, separation, and distance necessary for a socially conscious critique of the subject-centered framework of Idealist aesthetics and Positivist epistemology. This critical (dis) stance will further <b>enable</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> to initiate my own theory of graffiti as a socially conscious moment in the lived-city. ...|$|R

Integration of GaAsP alloys on Si substrates would enable the creation of high efficiency dual-junction solar cells on low cost and light weight Si wafers and would also <b>enable</b> <b>a</b> <b>path</b> for yellow and green light emission devices on a Si platform. Our work focused on the materials integration problems for multiple pathways to integrate GaAsP alloys on Si substrates. We first addressed the direct integration of GaAsP alloys on Si substrates. Our results showed that despite the low lattice-mismatch conditions at the P-rich end of the GaAsP alloy spectrum, it was difficult to achieve thin films low defect density. We proceeded to focus on the integration of GaAsP alloys on Si via the use of SiGe compositionally graded layers. Through a combination of methods we addressed problems related to antiphase disorder and lattice mismatch between GaAsP and SiGe materials system. We demonstrated the epitaxial growth lattice-matched GaAsP on Si₀. ₈₈Ge₀. ₁₂, Si₀. ₅Ge₀. ₅, Si₀. ₄Ge₀. ₆ and Si₀. ₃Ge₀. ₇ virtual substrates with excellent interface properties. Our studies showed the effects of initiation conditions and intentional strain at the GaAsP/SiGe heterovalent interface. We have established strain-engineering methods at the GaAsP/SiGe heterovalent interface to prevent dislocation loop nucleation and expansion. We were able to attain GaAsP films on Si with a threading dislocation density as low as 1. 2 x 10 ⁶/cm². Our GaAsP/SiGe heterovalent interface research advanced the understanding of such structures. We developed methods to fabricate optimized GaAsP tunnel junction film, which would be necessary for any current-matched dual junction solar cell design. Prototype dual-junction GaAsP/Si solar cell test devices showed good preliminary performance characteristics and offer great promise for future devices integrated with the newly developed high quality GaAsP/Si virtual substrates. by Prithu Sharma.

At present, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and the many factors that contribute to disease progression heterogeneity. Novel therapeutic targets and trial designs that incorporate existing and new biomarkers to evaluate drug effects independently and in combination are required. The integration of robust clinical data sets is viewed as a powerful approach to hasten medical discovery and therapies, as is being realized across diverse disease conditions employing big data analytics for healthcare. The application of lessons learned from parallel efforts is critical to identify barriers and <b>enable</b> <b>a</b> viable <b>path</b> forward. <b>A</b> roadmap is presented for a regulatory, academic, industry and advocacy driven integrated initiative that aims to facilitate and streamline new drug trials and registrations in Parkinson’s disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel quantum Monte Carlo method based on <b>a</b> <b>path</b> {{integral}} in Fock space, {{which allows the}} computation of finite-temperature properties of a many-body nuclear system with a monopole pairing interaction in the canonical ensemble. It <b>enables</b> <b>an</b> exact calculation of the thermodynamic variables such as the internal energy, the entropy, or the specific heat, from the measured moments {{of the number of}} hops in <b>a</b> <b>path</b> of nuclear configurations. Monte Carlo calculations for a single-shell (h 11 / 2) ^ 6 model are consistent with an exact calculation from the many-body spectrum in the seniority model...|$|R

We have three goals: to <b>enable</b> <b>a</b> motivated reader to start on <b>a</b> <b>path</b> towards effective use of ACL 2; to provide ideas for other interactive theorem prover projects; and to elicit feedback on how we might incorporate features of other proof tools into ACL 2. ...|$|R
40|$|Basic Network {{transactions}} specifies that datagram from {{source to}} destination is routed through numerous routers and paths {{depending on the}} available free and uncongested paths which results in the transmission route being too long, thus incurring greater delay, jitter, congestion and reduced throughput. One of the major problems of packet switched networks is the cell delay variation or jitter. This cell delay variation {{is due to the}} queuing delay depending on the applied loading conditions. The effect of delay, jitter accumulation due to the number of nodes along transmission routes and dropped packets adds further complexity to multimedia traffic because {{there is no guarantee that}} each traffic stream will be delivered according to its own jitter constraints therefore there is the need to analyze the effects of jitter. IP routers <b>enable</b> <b>a</b> single <b>path</b> for the transmission of all packets. On the other hand, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) allows separation of packet forwarding and routing characteristics to enable packets to use the appropriate routes and also optimize and control the behavior of transmission paths. Thus correcting some of the shortfalls associated with IP routing. Therefore MPLS has been utilized in the analysis for effective transmission through the various networks. This paper analyzes the effect of delay, congestion, interference, jitter and packet loss in the transmission of signals from source to destination. In effect the impact of link failures, repair paths in the various physical topologies namely bus, star, mesh and hybrid topologies are all analyzed based on standard network conditions...|$|R
