5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online identities, {{and the existence of}} communication forums established {{for the sole purpose of}} giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
25|$|A public march, {{organised}} by Melbourne photographer Phillip Werner, {{took place}} on 30 September 2012, {{two days after the}} discovery and recovery of Meagher's body. Approximately 30,000 people walked along Sydney Road in her memory. The march also symbolised broader concerns about violence against women, with <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> on current issues websites. Afterwards, Edith McKeon, Jill Meagher's mother, publicly thanked the Melbourne community for its support.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussions</b> of {{the choice}} divided the lab into two factions. In February 1979, matters {{came to a}} head. The hackers sided with Noftsker, believing that a {{commercial}} venture fund-backed firm had {{a better chance of}} surviving and commercializing Lisp machines than Greenblatt's proposed self-sustaining start-up. Greenblatt lost the battle.|$|R

500|$|On July 24, 2006, Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt {{started a}} thread titled [...] "Who is Essjay?" [...] (later retitled [...] "Who is Essjay?, Probably he's Ryan Jordan" [...] after Jordan's self-disclosure) on the forum site Wikipedia Review. The <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> {{brought to light}} contradictions in claims Essjay made about his {{academic}} qualifications and professional experiences on his Wikipedia user page. Jordan claimed that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law {{and worked as a}} tenured professor at a private university. Five days later, The New Yorker published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the claims. Wikipedia Review found definitive proof that Jordan made false claims about his qualifications and experience, including that he was a [...] "tenured professor", a claim that was used to describe Essjay in the interview for The New Yorker. In January 2007, Daniel Brandt contacted the author of the article in The New Yorker about the discrepancies in Jordan's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content.|$|E
500|$|While {{many readers}} praised the division's publications, some members criticized the new histories. In {{a meeting with}} {{institute}} teachers, Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, obliquely criticized some of the terms used in The Story of the Latter-day Saints, like [...] "primitivist" [...] and [...] "communitarian". After the publication of Dean C. Jessee's Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons, Boyd K. Packer, then an apostle, {{wrote a letter to}} the first presidency objecting to the inclusion of Young's tobacco use and the fact that his descendants were unhappy with the way Young's will was carried out. Packer preferred that a sanitized version be published and believed that the History Division's work ought to be sent through the Correlation Program. However, President Kimball found The Story of the Latter-Day Saints a [...] "great work." [...] A University of Utah undergraduate wrote a research paper connecting the New Mormon History coming from the Church Division with secularism and the work of anti-Mormon historians Jerald and Sandra Tanner. The paper quoted interviews with Mormon historians that were very unlikely to have been real. A copy of the paper reached the Quorum of the Twelve via Mark Petersen, and as a result of the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion,</b> several LDS historians were barred from publishing in church sources. Other critics were similarly non-confrontational, but had enough influence to constrain and redirect the historical department.|$|E

50|$|In the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussions,</b> Washington {{told the}} {{committee}} {{of his plan}} to arm ships to prey upon British supply lines.

50|$|The shire {{was formed}} in 1978 {{as a result of}} the Queensland Government's {{decision}} to take over control of the islands from the Uniting Church. The local community sought the assistance of the Federal Government to overturn the decision. The establishment of self governance for the community under a Local Government model was the result of the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussions.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Gates camp then {{engaged in}} a series of actions that Arnold {{perceived}} to be an attack. [...] James Wilkinson wrote a letter to General Arthur St. Clair in Philadelphia in which he implied not only that Arnold was not involved in the battle, but that he was an impediment to Gates. [...] Gates' official report to Congress notably made no mention of Arnold, Morgan, or other officers involved in leading the action, and specifically mentioned Arnold's nemesis John Brown, who had made an attack against Fort Ticonderoga the day before the battle. [...] A decision by Gates concerning Morgan's unit then caused relationships between Gates and Arnold to break down completely. [...] Morgan's unit had technically been under Gates' command, but it had operated in the battle under Arnold's division and his direction. [...] Gates formally realigned the units to reiterate that Morgan reported to him and not Arnold. [...] The <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> between Gates and Arnold on September 22 escalated into a shouting match, and ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command. [...] Arnold requested a pass to rejoin Washington's army, which he was given. [...] However, for unknown reasons, he decided to stay in camp. [...] A common account of a memorial signed by Gates' field commanders encouraging him to stay has no basis in the documentary record; it is known that Brigadier Enoch Poor, who had been critical of Arnold during the court martial at Ticonderoga, and other officers openly considered the idea. [...] This support for Arnold may {{have played a role in}} his announcement on September 26 that he was staying in camp even though his differences with Gates had not been resolved.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the play}} is steeped in scriptural allusion. The boy from Act One {{mentions}} {{that he and his}} brother mind Godot's sheep and goats. Much can be read into Beckett's inclusion of the story of the two thieves from Luke 23:39–43 and the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> of repentance. It is easy to see the solitary tree as representative of the Christian cross or the tree of life. Some see God and Godot as one and the same. Vladimir's [...] "Christ have mercy upon us!" [...] could be taken as evidence that that is at least what he believes.|$|E
2500|$|Wilkos {{holding that}} the right to litigate could not be waived, O'Connor continued, [...] "can only be {{understood}} {{in the context of the}} Court's <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> explaining why arbitration was inadequate as a means of enforcing 'the provisions of the Securities Act, advantageous to the buyer' ... The conclusion in Wilko was expressly based on the Court's belief that a judicial forum was needed to protect the substantive rights created by the Securities Act." [...] The Court's pro-arbitration holding in Scherk, she wrote, [...] "supports our understanding that Wilko must be read as barring waiver of a judicial forum only where arbitration is inadequate to protect the substantive rights at issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quebec Premier Jean Charest, a federalist {{and former}} {{leader of the}} federal Progressive Conservative Party, {{condemned}} the [...] "anti-sovereigntist rhetoric" [...] of the prime minister, emphasizing that the Bloc MPs had been legitimately elected by Quebecers, and stating: [...] "I {{live in a society}} in which people can be sovereigntists or federalists, but they respect each other. The same thing should prevail in the federal parliament." [...] He also accused Parti Québécois leader Pauline Marois of using the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> about the coalition to attempt to build sovereigntist momentum. [...] Former Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau told Le Journal de Montréal that the deal was an [...] "impressive victory", showing how powerful the Bloc Québécois is in federal politics.|$|E
2500|$|Figaro's hearing follows, and the Count's {{judgment}} is that Figaro must marry Marcellina. Figaro argues that he cannot get married without his parents' permission, {{and that he}} does not know who his parents are, because he was stolen from them when he was a baby. The <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> reveals that Figaro is Rafaello, the long-lost illegitimate son of Bartolo and Marcellina. A touching scene of reconciliation occurs. During the celebrations, Susanna enters with a payment to release Figaro from his debt to Marcellina. Seeing Figaro and Marcellina in celebration together, Susanna mistakenly believes that Figaro now prefers Marcellina to her. She has a tantrum and slaps Figaro's face. Marcellina explains, and Susanna, realizing her mistake, joins the celebration. Bartolo, overcome with emotion, agrees to marry Marcellina that evening in a double wedding (sextet: Riconosci in questo amplesso – [...] "Recognize in this embrace").|$|E
2500|$|To combat what it saw as {{a coming}} crisis, the {{government}} now drafted the Rowlatt committee's recommendations into two Rowlatt Bills. Although the bills were authorised for legislative consideration by Edwin Montagu, they were done so unwillingly, with the accompanying declaration, [...] "I loathe the suggestion at first sight of preserving the Defence of India Act in peace time {{to such an extent}} as Rowlatt and his friends think necessary." [...] In the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion</b> and vote in the Imperial Legislative Council, all Indian members voiced opposition to the bills. [...] The Government of India was nevertheless able to use of its [...] "official majority" [...] to ensure passage of the bills early in 1919. However, what it passed, in deference to the Indian opposition, was a lesser version of the first bill, which now allowed extrajudicial powers, but for a period of exactly three years and for the prosecution solely of [...] "anarchical and revolutionary movements," [...] dropping entirely the second bill involving modification of the Indian Penal Code. Even so, when it was passed the new Rowlatt Act aroused widespread indignation throughout India and brought Mohandas Gandhi to the forefront of the nationalist movement.|$|E
40|$|Although {{often viewed}} as an action of last resort, going on strike remains a legal and often {{effective}} option for physicians seeking labor improvements and better working conditions. Indeed, in some countries, {{there have been reports}} of strikes by physicians (1, 2), followed by <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussions</b> of potential ethical implications (3 5).

Assurances were given that the expedition wouldn't trade with the neighboring Arikara, Mandan and the Gros Ventre nations, all three of whom the Sioux were at war with. After this the expedition was allowed to continue towards the Pacific Coast.|$|R

2500|$|Winters sends a list {{of demands}} to the world governments and gives them thirty minutes to comply, and {{subsequently}} orders Kettlewell to connect to the launch computers and prepare to send the launch codes. Kettlewell, who never expected their plan {{to get to this}} stage, hesitates, and in the <b>ensuing</b> <b>discussion,</b> Sarah Jane and Harry attempt to escape with Kettlewell's assistance. Winters orders K1 to stop the pair, but the robot, already conflicted to its programming, inadvertently fires the disintegrator gun at Kettlewell, killing him. The death of its creator puts K1 in a further confused state, falling to the ground and apparently shutting down. [...] Winters attempts to program the countdown, but the Doctor arrives and successfully counters it. As UNIT forces take Winters and Jellicoe away, K1 reactivates and begins to attack UNIT. K1 seeks out Sarah Jane to protect her, a result of an Oedipus complex it developed from Sarah Jane's previous compassion, according to the Doctor. UNIT fires the disintegrator gun at the robot but the blast is absorbed, causing the robot to grow to an enormous size. Realising the growth is due to the living metal that Kettlewell used in constructing K1, the Doctor races back to Kettlewell's lab to synthesize a batch of metal-biodegradable virus, a side discovery made by Kettlewell. The Doctor throws a bucket of solution containing the virus onto K1, and the robot slowly shrinks down in size before it vanishes.|$|E

We take issue with this view, and instead argue that the Dictator Game is potentially a very useful tool for experimental game theory, if properly used. It is particularly useful for investigating social norms, but economists have failed {{to take advantage of the}} Dictator Game because they still lack an adequate theory of norms. ...|$|R
