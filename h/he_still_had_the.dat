5|$|After leaving City, Trautmann played, for a month, for Wellington Town, {{who offered}} him £50 per match, signing in September 1964 to replace an injured regular keeper. Age had diminished his abilities, but his debut at Hereford showed <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability to draw crowds. However, {{he was sent}} off at Tonbridge for violent conduct in his second match, and never played again. For Wellington, he had saved two matches and been on losing side in five.|$|E
5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dry fever.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking some}} time off to re-evaluate, Darchinyan knocked out Pakpoom Hammarach in one round on 10 March 2017. The fight was taken by Darchinyan not for the money, but to see if <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> hunger and desire to {{continue}} his boxing career. Taking place in Perth, this {{would be his last}} fight in Australia. He has confirmed his next fight will be his last and expressed interest in one more big fight against Evgeny Gradovich in Russia or Carl Frampton in England.|$|E
25|$|Gifford's England career, however, was {{not quite}} over. He made his One Day International debut – {{extraordinarily}} as captain – {{in the absence of}} David Gower who was being rested, at the age of 44 in the 1984/85 'Rothmans Four-Nations Cup' contest in Sharjah. England lost both their matches, against Australia and Pakistan, but Gifford showed that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability in the second game when he took 4–23 including the prize wicket of Imran Khan for a first-ball duck. Despite this performance, however, these two games proved to be the extent of Gifford's brief ODI career.|$|E

25|$|A {{definite}} {{course of}} direction was needed after this incident and in 2010 {{he started his}} PE bachelor, he finished the four-year study in 2014 and also received the academic medal for being the student of his year. In {{the last two years}} of his study he combined playing for the national team. The World Cricket League games in Namibia proved that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> level to play at international level as he steered the Netherlands home with a 65 to win by 1 wicket. The Netherlands also played the English Lions in a 3-match series, which surprisingly the Dutch won 2-1. Van Bunge had his part to play with some solid scores.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} case {{reported}} {{is that of}} patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison's chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy (both of his MTLs were removed). As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened {{more than a few}} minutes earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to learn some new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Zamenhof {{would later}} {{say that he}} had dreamed of a world {{language}} since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled Швейцарская (švejtsarskaja, a porter's lodge – from швейцар švejtsar, a porter) and Кондитерская (konditerskaja, a confectioner's shop – from кондитер konditer, a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.|$|E

25|$|The way to Martaban was now open. Unlike before, Laukpya had not {{opened the}} western front. But Byattaba did not panic. <b>He</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{support of his}} other brothers, E Bya Bon and U-Lo, who were commanders in his army, and had {{collected}} enough men and arms. When the Martaban command heard that a Pegu army was taking a circuitous route through the woods to encircle the city from the east, the brothers planned a surprise attack outside the city. In the wee hours, the Martaban army, led by the three brothers themselves, ambushed and destroyed the five vanguard regiments of the Pegu army. But the Martaban command {{did not know that}} two Pegu rearguard regiments, led by generals Smim Than-Byat and Dein, were still in the area. While the Martaban army dispersed to mop up the remaining enemies in the area, Than-Byat launched a surprise attack targeting the battalions guarding the Martaban command. It worked. Byattaba, E Bya Bon and U-Lo all fled. The remaining Martaban forces surrendered.|$|E
25|$|In early 63 BC, {{shortly after}} Marcus Tullius Cicero took office as consul, Julius Caesar urged Titus Labienus, a tribune {{who had lost}} his uncle during the turmoils of 100 BC, to accuse Gaius Rabirius of {{participating}} {{in the murder of}} Saturninus and his followers. Caesar's true motive was to undermine the authority of the SCU, limiting its power and defending the sovereignty of the people against the senatorial interference made possible by the decree. The importance of the trial is illustrated by the fact that Cicero himself, even though he was incumbent consul, decided to lead the defense for Rabirius. The trial was carried out in the obsolete form of perduellio, with Caesar and his cousin Lucius Julius Caesar presiding. Cicero argued that even though Rabirius was a privatus (private man) and therefore not the addressee of the decree, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> duty as a Roman citizen to defend the state against its enemies, resorting to the ancient Roman principle of self-help. Labienus and Caesar argued the contrary: Even if the SCU gave the power to execute capital punishment, it should only be carried out by the highest magistrates. Rabirius was convicted but escaped punishment through a ruse during the appeal before the Concilium Plebis. The authority of the decree was nevertheless shaken and in no further cases did private persons act out a SCU.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E

Looking 4 Myself further explored those genres into progressive R, hip hop ballads and synth pop as the overall sound was coined [...] "hybrid pop" [...] for its additional incorporation of EDM, Dubstep, Neo soul and Funk as his most diverse work.
