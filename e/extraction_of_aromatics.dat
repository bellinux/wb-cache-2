As solvents, the ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium dicyanamide (P 666, 14 [N(CN) 2]) and ethyl acetate (EA) were compared. Two pyrolytic sugar solutions were created from acid-leached and untreated pinewood, with levoglucosan contents (most abundant sugar) of 29. 0 % and 8. 3 % (w/w), respectively. In a single stage extraction, 70 % of the aromatics were effectively removed by P 666, 14 [N(CN) 2] and 50 % by EA, while no levoglucosan was extracted. The IL was regenerated by vacuum evaporation (100 mbar) at 220 °C, followed by <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatics</b> from fresh pyrolytic sugar solutions.

In this study, capability of this IL for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatics</b> from aliphatic + aromatic mixtures via liquid–liquid extraction is evaluated. Therefore, the solubilities of the liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons (hexane, heptane) and the liquid aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene (= BTEX)) in [emim][FAP] have been measured at different temperatures. The ternary liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE) data for the ternary systems {hexane + benzene + [emim][FAP]}, {heptane + toluene + [emim][FAP]}, {octane + ethylbenzene + [emim][FAP]} and {octane + o-xylene + [emim][FAP]} have been measured at T/K = 293. 15 and atmospheric pressure.

It includes ultrasonic extraction, refluxing extraction, alkaline hydrolysis and accelerated solvent extraction [1]. Aromatic monomers could be used for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an annual herbaceous plant. The natural fractions resulting from the industrial transformation of hemp are hemp fiber and its two co-products hemp wood and hemp dust. 5, 500 tons of hemp wood and 2, 300 tons of hemp dust are produced from the transformation of 10, 000 tons of raw material. Hemp fiber is largely used in paper, for clothing and for the manufacture and reinforcing of every type of composites. Hemp wood and dust are used in gardening, stockbreeding and as litter for animals because of their high absorption capacity. Developing higher value-added applications from these natural by-products would secure the hemp sector. As these coproducts are rich in lignin, the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> monomers in particular ferulic and coumaric acids can represent an interesting valorization for hemp wood and dust. Characterization of this two coproducts using Van Soest method provided a value of 86. 8 % in lignocellulosic materials (50. 6 % cellulose, 18. 2 % hemicelluloses and 18. 0 % lignin) for hemp wood compared to 61. 7 % in lignocellulosic materials (43. 9 % cellulose, 10. 7 % hemicelluloses and 7. 0 % lignin) for hemp dust.

Only a small number of ionic liquids are able to combine higher mass-based distribution coefficients with selectivities comparable to or higher than those of sulfolane. The most suitable ILs from our analysis are [bmim]C(CN) 3, [3 -mebupy]N(CN) 2, [3 -mebupy]C(CN) 3, and [3 -mebupy]B(CN) 4. The mass-based distribution coefficients with these four ILs for benzene, toluene, and p-xylene are factors of 1. 2 - 2. 5 higher than those with sulfolane, and the aromatic/aliphatic selectivities are up to a factor of 1. 9 higher than with sulfolane. Based on the performed analysis, it can be concluded that industrial application <b>of</b> ILs for <b>aromatics</b> <b>extraction</b> has not yet materialized because only four of the total of 121 investigated ILs are considered suitable for aromatic/aliphatic separation. Most of the reported ILs do not provide higher mass-based aromatic distribution coefficients and/or higher aromatic/aliphatic selectivities than those achieved by conventional solvents such as sulfolane...|$|R
40|$|Pilot-plant {{experiments}} in a Kühni extractor for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> toluene from a heptane+toluene mixture {{by means of}} the ionic liquid [3 -mebupy][DCA] were performed. Previous work (Meindersma et al., 2010, 2012) has shown that [3 -mebupy][DCA] is a promising solvent for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> substances such as toluene. An alternative approach to performing time and material consuming pilot-plant experiments is modelling with the drop population-balance model ReDrop. Models in the ReDrop program accounting for different phenomena, such as drop sedimentation, drop breakage and coalescence as well as mass transfer, contain liquid-liquid system specific parameters that are fitted to lab-scale experiments with single drops. A single-drop sedimentation experiment with heptane (c) +toluene+[3 -mebupy][DCA] (d) was performed and the parameters of the sedimentation model fitted to the experimental data. Models accounting for the hindrance of drop sedimentation due to column internals and models for drop breakage were taken from the literature. On this basis, the Kühni extractor was then simulated with ReDrop. Hydrodynamic parameters such as hold-up and Sauter mean diameter are in good agreement with the experimental data. Also the mass-transfer performance of the [3 -mebupy][DCA] in combination with the Kühni extractor was modeled with good accuracy. It was shown that the ReDrop concept is a promising alternative to pilot-plant {{experiments in}} terms of need of materials and time to evaluate new ILs for their usability in extraction columns...|$|R
40|$|Malaysia, {{like many}} other {{developing}} countries, possesses abundant aromatic plant resources. Thus, the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>aromatic</b> plant essential oils offers an economic opportunity. Essential oil {{is one of a}} plant's primary metabolites, and this valuable product is in great demand in many industries and for numerous applications such as aromatic and fragrance products [1], food and flavorings [2], cosmetics [3], insect repellents and pesticides [4], medicine, and so forth. Moreover, public awareness of natural products has increased, and essential oils provide an alternative to synthetic chemicals and drugs. The consumer demand for essential oil products greatly depends on oil concentration and purity. Furthermore, for industrial standards, essential oil production must be maximized while maintaining reasonable quality, which can be achieved through the advancement <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> technology. Hence, many research efforts involving the distillation process, from advanced to conventional schemes, have aimed to establish and improve techniques for enhancing the quality and production volumes of essential oil. Based on common practice, the steam distillation technique is still preferred and applied in many industrial and research areas due to several factors such as system cost, cleanliness, productivity, and operational cost [5], and its reliability for the mass production of essential oil [6, 7]...|$|R
