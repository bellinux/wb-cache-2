For an estimation of influence of external influences on temperature <b>indicators</b> of <b>oils</b> ICE and transmission elements full factorial experiment which is directed on definition of temperature of oil ICE, a transmission and the main transfers has been realized. Modeling of influence of external influences on temperature <b>indicators</b> of <b>oils</b> ICE and transmission elements consisted in the following: the conceptual model was under construction; its formalization and research of modeled process was spent; necessary approximations were defined; the generalised scheme of process was under construction; under this generalized scheme the algorithm was created and the program complex was developed; calculations on the computer were spent; mathematical and graphic dependences of external influences on temperature <b>indicators</b> of <b>oils</b> ICE and transmission elements were defined; practical recommendations about heating process with reference to operational conditions of SNO OP were developed.

THe insistence on single shocks as the causes of recessions is erroneous: the older emphasis on movements in the growth of demand, money and credit, profits and investment deserve a revival. The relatively new but now widely held belief is that, for the recession-free stability to reign, real growth must be no more than moderate and inflation must stay quiescent but financial asset prices can rise indefinitely. The risk of overheating alone is being emphasized but downside as well as upside risks exist and both need to be continually considered. "...|$|R

The estimation results show that there are significant direct spillovers while indirect spillovers also matters in many cases. Based on these results, we show that growing LIC-BRIC ties have significantly helped alleviate the adverse impact of the recent global financial crisis on LIC economies.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} approach to fiscal policy analysis in oil producing countries (OPCs) geared towards addressing their unique and complex policy challenges. First, an accurate {{assessment of the}} fiscal stance in OPCs can be obscured by large and volatile oil revenue flows. Second, uncertain and volatile oil revenue flows can complicate the management of macroeconomic policies in these countries. Third, given the exhaustibility of oil reserves, OPCs need to address longer-term sustainability and intergenerational equity issues. The use of non-oil fiscal indicators, stress tests, medium-term frameworks, and permanent oil income models can greatly aid in addressing these challenges.
