25|$|The {{role of the}} gas is {{to prevent}} {{evaporation}} of the filament, without introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by heat conduction and <b>heat</b> <b>convection.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} that couples the electric field, velocity field, and temperature field is developed {{based on the}} commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics. The influences of several factors on convective heat transfer on a heated plate in the electric field generated by a needle electrode are observed.

5000|$|Convective heat {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the major types of {{heat transfer}}, and convection is also a major mode of mass transfer in fluids. Convective heat and mass transfer take place both by diffusion - the random Brownian motion of individual particles in the fluid - and by advection, in which matter or heat is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the context of heat and mass transfer, the term [...] "convection" [...] is used to refer to the sum of [...] and diffusive transfer. In common use the term [...] "convection" [...] may refer loosely to heat transfer by convection, as opposed to mass transfer by convection, or the convection process in general. Sometimes [...] "convection" [...] is even used to refer specifically to [...] "free heat convection" [...] (natural <b>heat</b> <b>convection)</b> as opposed to forced <b>heat</b> <b>convection.</b> However, in mechanics the correct use of the word is the general sense, and different types of convection should be qualified for clarity.|$|E

30|$|The {{implications}} of the Fe snow regime for the core dynamics and magnetic field evolution are controversial. Hauck et al. (2006) proposed that the sinking iron particles may cause motions within the fluid of the stable snow zone and, thereby, provide the driving force for the magnetic field of Ganymede. By applying the magnetic field strength scaling law of Christensen and Aubert (2006), they found surface magnetic field strengths between 600 and 1600  nT. However, Hauck et al. (2006) failed to explain why particle settling in a stably stratified fluid would cause the large-scale fluid motions that are necessary for a dynamo (Christensen and Wicht 2007). Zhan and Schubert (2012) used a magneto-hydrodynamic dynamo model and assumed that the sinking of iron crystals in the snow zone would be equivalent to internally <b>heated</b> <b>convection.</b> They found multipolar solutions for the magnetic field, at variance with the observed strong dipolarity of the field (Kivelson et al. 2002). Their main assumption that Fe snow resembles internally <b>heated</b> <b>convection</b> is questionable, {{because they did not}} model the particular flow. These authors suggested that dipole-dominated magnetic fields are only possible for FeS floating dynamos and inner-core growth, the latter implying a low concentration of sulfur.|$|R

The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen.|$|E

Based on a general heat absorption equation without chemical reaction, this study was focused on some crucial factors which influence pulverized coal {{ignition time}} to theoretically explain the mechanism of heat absorption of pulverized coal. The influences of recirculated flue gas (RFG) temperature, flame temperature, primary air temperature, and coal particle diameter on ignition time were discussed. The importance of radiation <b>heat</b> and <b>convection</b> <b>heat</b> was analyzed. The {{results show that the}} higher temperatures of RFG, flame, and primary air can lead to the shorter ignition time respectively. The increase of the coal particle diameter greatly increases the ignition time, and as the diameter goes up, the amount of the ignition delay becomes greater. For high accuracy of ignition time calculation, both radiation <b>heat</b> and <b>convection</b> <b>heat</b> should be taken into account. When flame temperature is very high and RFG temperature is very low, radiation is the dominant factor, otherwise convection is more crucial...|$|R
