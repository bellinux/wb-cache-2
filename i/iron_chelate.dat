5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with <b>iron</b> <b>chelate</b> or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. Tough enough {{to be used as}} a street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with <b>iron</b> <b>chelate</b> or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied seed to Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the detail study of <b>iron</b> <b>chelating</b> {{property}} of malic acid has not yet been reported. Due to low biodegradability (e.g., BOD 5 of EDTA: 0.01 %), the disposal of <b>iron</b> <b>chelates</b> used in Lo-CAT process raised serious environmental concern [28]. In order to overcome this environmental pollution, there is need to look for alternative <b>iron</b> <b>chelating</b> agents. The carboxylic acids are known to possess high rate of biodegradation (e.g., BOD 5 of malic acid: 65 %) along with good <b>iron</b> <b>chelating</b> property. The results of the present investigation indicated that Fe+ 3 –malic acid <b>iron</b> <b>chelates</b> in w/o microemulsion can effectively oxidize hazardous H 2 S gas to produce sulfur nanoparticles. Besides reduction in environmental pollution (use of biodegradable chelating agents) and waste utilization (H 2 S abatement), the described process also has high commercial significance.|$|R

50|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>chelate</b> is {{commonly}} used for agricultural purposes to treat chlorosis, {{a condition in which}} leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll.

It is recommended in ornamental horticulture for feeding ericaceous plants like Rhododendrons if they are growing in calcareous soils. The Sequestered iron is available to the ericaceous plants, without adjusting the soil's pH, and thus lime-induced chlorosis is prevented.|$|E

40|$|Ferritins are iron-storage {{proteins}} that accumulate in plastids during seed formation, {{and also in}} leaves during senescence or iron overload. Iron release from ferritins occurs during growth of seedlings and greening of plastids. Depending on the concentration of the reducing agent ascorbate, either an overall iron release or uptake by ferritins from iron(III) citrate may occur. We have designed methods to measure these simultaneous and independent uptake and release fluxes. Each individual step of the exchange was studied using different <b>iron</b> <b>chelates</b> and an excess of ligand. It is shown that: (i) the <b>chelated</b> form of <b>iron,</b> and not ionic Fe 3 +, is the substrate for iron reduction, which controls the subsequent uptake by ferritin; (ii) iron uptake by ferritins is faster at pH 8. 4 than at pH 7 or 6 and is inhibited by an excess of strongly binding free ligands; and (iii) strongly binding free ligands are inhibitory during iron release by ascorbate. When reactions are allowed to proceed simultaneously, the <b>iron</b> <b>chelating</b> power is {{shown to be a}} key factor in the overall exchange.
