40|$|<b>Immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> is an {{integral}} part of the final settlement of a foundation resting on a clay soil. This paper compares the results based on three assumptions, that are, rigid footing, distributed loading on an open pit and distributed loading in a soil layer. Relatively large differences are observed between these three assumptions. In estimating the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> of an embedded footing, it is preferred that a loading condition that approximates the real condition is selected. Coefficients of <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> presented in the paper can also be used to estimate the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> of embedded foundation in an isotropic elastic soil.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite layer procedure for Biot's consolidation analysis of layered soils using a cross-anisotropic elastic constitutive model. The program is first verified using published results. Then, using this program, {{the influences of}} cross-anisotropy on the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement,</b> the final settlement, and the consolidation behaviour are investigated by changing one model parameter at one time. The results obtained using the cross-anisotropic elastic model are compared with results using an isotropic elastic model. It is found that the cross-anisotropy has very large influences on the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement,</b> the final settlement, and the consolidation behaviour. Curves or tables of the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> coefficients, the final settlement coefficients, and the average degree of consolidation are obtained and presented in the paper. These curves or tables can be easily used to estimate the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement,</b> the final settlement, and the consolidation settlement of a cross-anisotropic soil.

40|$|The paper reports some {{experimental}} studies {{carried out on}} hydraulic fills, {{in an attempt to}} understand their settlement pattern which is quite different to what has been reported for clays and sands. The <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> in hydraulic fills is about 60 % of the total settlement, and the remaining 40 % of the time-dependent settlement includes primary and secondary compression components which are difficult to separate. The inter-relationship among permeability, effective stress and settlement is also investigated. It appears that the coefficient of secondary compression Cα increases with the applied loading but is independent of time. Settlement (s) is a bilinear function of logarithm of time, taking the form of s = s 0 + a log t, where s 0 is approximately the <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhile many spread {{footings}} {{constructed on}} clayey soils are designed using consolidation settlement analyses for the serviceability limit state (SLS), <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement,</b> or undrained displacement, of the footing may also contribute {{a significant portion}} of the total and/or differential settlement. Owing to possible magnitudes in <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement,</b> and with regard to stress history, assessment of the contribution of <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> comprises an essential task for the understanding of the performance of a foundation system. This study proposes a simple reliability-based design (RBD) procedure for assessing the allowable immediate displacement of a spread footing supported on clay in consideration of a desired serviceability limit state. A relationship between the traditional spread footing bearing capacity equation and slope tangent capacity is established, then incorporated into a bivariate normalized bearing pressure–displacement model to estimate the mobilized resistance associated with a given displacement. The model was calibrated using a high quality database of full-scale loading tests compiled from various sources. The loading test data was used to characterize the uncertainty associated with the model and incorporated into an appropriate reliability-based performance function. Monte Carlo simulations were then used to calibrate a resistance factor with consideration of the uncertainty in the bearing pressure–displacement model, bearing capacity, applied bearing pressure, allowable displacement, and footing width. An example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed procedure to estimate the bearing pressure for an allowable immediate displacement of a footing at the targeted probability and serviceability limit state...|$|R

40|$|In {{consolidation}} {{tests on}} compacted soils as embankment materials, the curve representing the time versus settlement relationship has a characteristic shape, due partly {{to the great}} amount of <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement.</b> On {{the basis of this}} phenomenon, the author derived a consolidation equation for unsaturation using a stress-strain relation employing a viscoelastic (Voigt's) model. In order to approximate experimental values to the equation for the degree of consolidation, the author developed a method for determining several parameters of consolidation, which govern the behavior of compacted soils consolidation. It was concluded that the application of this method gave satisfactory agreement for the time versus consolidation settlement relationships in case of both sudden settlement just after consolidation loading and without such <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement.</b> For the application of this method, the computed parameters indicated are Young's modulus, the coefficient of viscosity, the compressibility of the pore fluid, the unsaturated permeability and so on, for an example consolidation of pressure p= 6. 4 kgf/cm 2.

40|$|The paper investigates typical Baltic sea-shore sand along Klaipėda and diagnoses {{the level}} of {{particle}} crushing after different loading steps. An oedometer test is done applying to drained loose (e 0 = 0, 764) and dense (e 0 = 0, 604) sand. The used loading steps are 0, 0; 200, 0; 400, 0; 600, 0; 800, 0 kPa. Investigation into {{the level of}} particle crushing is made conducting a sieve test employing spherical balls on the sieves of a different size. The sieve test is done following different loading levels. The results of the grading curve show that 800, 0 kPa vertical stress does not crushes the particles of the oedometer sample. The analysis of the compression results of loose and dense sand shows that a determined <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> of sample appears when vertical stress makes from 50, 0 kPa to 120, 0 kPa and where <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> values {{do not belong to}} the density of the sand sample.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Shallow {{foundations}} are extensively used {{to support}} structures of all sizes and derive their support from near surface soils. Thus, they are typically embedded up to a few meters into the soil profile. Designers of shallow foundations are required to meet two limit states: overall failure of the soil beneath the foundation (bearing capacity) and excessive settlement. Existing bearing capacity design methods use an assumed shearing plane within the soil and perfectly plastic soil behavior to estimate the ultimate resistance available. The <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> of a shallow foundation is typically approximated using an elasticity-based method that {{does not account for}} actual, nonlinear soil behavior. A load test database was developed from footing load tests reported in the literature to assess the accuracy and uncertainty in existing design methodologies for calculating bearing capacity and <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement.</b> The assessment of uncertainty in bearing capacity and <b>immediate</b> <b>settlement</b> was accomplished through the application of a hyperbolic bearing pressure-displacement model, and the adaptation of the Duncan-Chang soil constitutive model to footing displacements. The prediction of bearing capacity using the general bearing capacity formula was compared to the bearing capacity extrapolated from the load test database using a hyperbolic bearing pressure-displacement model. On average the general bearing capacity formula under-predicts the bearing capacity and exhibits a significant amount of variability. The comparison was used to develop resistance statistics that were implemented to produce resistance factors for an LRFD based design approach using AASHTO load statistics. The Duncan-Chang model was adapted to predict bearing pressure displacement curves for footings in the load test database and used to estimate governing soil parameters. Bearing pressure-displacement curves fitted to the observed curves were used to back calculate soil stiffness. The soil stiffness was used with an elasticity-based displacement prediction method to evaluate the accuracy of the method. Finally, the back-calculated modulus from the fitted Duncan-Chang model was used to assess the accuracy and uncertainty associated with the elasticity-based K-factor, a correlation based stiffness parameter. In general the comparisons indicate that the current design procedures over-predict the bearing pressure associated with a given displacement and exhibit a significant amount of uncertainty...|$|R
