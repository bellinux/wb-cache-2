However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E

Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while <b>dropping</b> <b>her</b> off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways.

25|$|In {{the first}} book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully {{his very first}} time on a broom, she {{recommends}} him to fill the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her <b>dropping</b> <b>her</b> usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry she would do everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and she keeps her promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{that her}} {{success in the}} music {{industry}} was attributed to {{being a member of the}} Jackson family and a producer-dependent artist led her to write all lyrics for the album, in addition to co-producing every song and co-writing each of their arrangements with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its title, read [...] "Janet, period.", is meant to disassociate her public image from her family, <b>dropping</b> <b>her</b> surname. A pop and R record, Janet incorporated hip hop, opera, house and jazz, eliminating the rigid, industrial sound of her previous records. Lyrically, the theme of Janet is sexual intimacy—an abrupt departure from her conservative image. Much of her lyrics emphasize a woman's perspective on sexuality and the demand for practicing safe sex.|$|E
