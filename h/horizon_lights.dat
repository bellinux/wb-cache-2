50|$|Apparent horizons are not {{invariant}} {{properties of}} a spacetime, {{and in particular}} they are distinct from event horizons. Within an apparent <b>horizon,</b> <b>light</b> is not {{moving away from the}} black hole, whereas in an event <b>horizon,</b> <b>light</b> cannot escape from the black hole. It is possible for light to be currently moving away from the black hole (and so outside the apparent horizon), but in the future {{will not be able to}} escape (e.g. because the mass of the black hole is growing) and therefore inside the event horizon. Thus the apparent horizon can be thought of as the boundary of black hole for light at this instant, whereas the event horizon is the boundary of the black hole for light in the future.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the variability properties of blazars in the GeV band using {{the data of}} the Fermi/LAT telescope. We find that blazars exhibit variability on the scales down to the minimal timescale resolvable by Fermi, which {{is a function of}} the peak photon count rate in the LAT. This implies that the real minimal variability timescales for the majority of blazars are typically shorter than those resolvable by the LAT. We find that for several blazars these minimal variability timescales reach those associated to the blazar central engine, the supermassive black hole. At the same time, none of the blazars exhibits variability on the timescale shorter than the black hole <b>horizon</b> <b>light</b> crossing time and/or the period of rotation around the last stable circular orbit. Based on this fact, we argue that the timing properties of the gamma-ray signal could be determined by the processes in the direct vicinity of the supermassive black hole.

In this paper we present a method to render very large forest scenes in realtime, with realistic lighting at all scales, and without popping nor aliasing. Our method is based on two new forest representations, z-fields and shader-maps, with a seamless transition between them. Our first model builds on light fields and height fields to represent and render the nearest trees individually, accounting for all lighting effects. Our second model is a location, view and light dependent shader mapped on the terrain, accounting for the cumulated subpixel effects.

However, linkages between PHC biodegradation and microbial community dynamics in the mycorrhizosphere of boreal forest soils are poorly understood.

Genotypic profiles of root-associated bacterial communities were generated using length heterogeneity-PCR of 16 S rDNA. Most plant–soil treatments showed significant loss in the smaller fraction PHCs indicating an inherent capacity for biodegradation. Concentrations of total PHCs declined significantly only in planted (pine-woody debris and birch-humus) systems (averaging 59 % and 82 % loss between 1 and 16 weeks respectively), reinforcing the importance of the mycorrhizosphere for enhancing microbial catabolism. Bacterial community structure was correlated more with mycorrhizosphere type and complexity than with PHC contamination. However, results suggest that communities in PHC-contaminated and pristine soils may become distinct over time...|$|R
50|$|Light {{from the}} sky {{is a result of}} the {{scattering}} of sunlight, which results in a blue color perceived by the human eye. On a sunny day Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue gradient — dark in the zenith, <b>light</b> near the <b>horizon.</b> <b>Light</b> that comes in from overhead encounters 1/38th of the air mass that light coming along a horizon path encounters. So, fewer particles scatter the zenith sunbeam, and therefore the light remains a darker blue. The blueness is at the horizon because the blue light coming from great distances is also preferentially scattered. This results in a red shift of the far lightsources that is compensated by the blue hue of the scattered light in the line of sight. In other words, the red light scatters also; if it does so at a point a great distance from the observer it has a much higher chance of reaching the observer than blue light. At distances nearing infinity the scattered light is therefore white. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops will seem yellow for that reason; that effect is not obvious on clear days, but very pronounced when clouds are covering the line of sight reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.|$|R
