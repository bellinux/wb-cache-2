5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> was supposed to be in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits {{what appears to be the}} visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1849, the French Ballet Master Jules Perrot arrived in St. Petersburg, having {{accepted}} the position of premier maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. He was accompanied by his chief collaborator, the prolific Italian composer Cesare Pugni, who was appointed Ballet Composer of the Imperial Theatres, a position created especially for him. Aside from dancing the principal rôles in many of Perrot's productions, Petipa rehearsed older works with the company and assisted Perrot in staging revivals (such as Giselle in 1850, and Le Corsaire in 1858), all the while learning a great deal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{was at that time}} the most celebrated choreographer in Europe. Although Petipa did not create his own original works during this period, he nevertheless staged many dances for various operas, and on occasion revised dances for Perrot's many revivals of older works.|$|E
500|$|Station to Station {{is often}} cited as a {{transitional}} album in Bowie's career. Nicholas Pegg, author of The Complete David Bowie, called it a [...] "precise halfway point on the journey from Young Americans to Low", while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it [...] "effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of Ziggy Stardust and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with Low." [...] In terms of Bowie's own output, Station to Stations Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like [...] "Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] (1973), while its funk/disco elements were a development of the soul/R sound of Young Americans (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to soak up the influence of [...] krautrock and electronic music by bands like Neu!, Can, and Kraftwerk. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as [...] "The Supermen" [...] <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Sold the World (1970) and [...] "Quicksand" [...] from Hunky Dory (1971): Nietzsche's 'Overman', the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Nazi fascination with Grail mythology, and the Kabbalah. Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of [...] "occultism and Christianity".|$|E

500|$|During Brain's {{tenure at}} de Havilland, the company {{manufactured}} sixty-nine Vampire T35 jet trainers at its Bankstown factory for delivery to the RAAF, {{as well as}} Sea Venoms for the RAN. Leaving deHavilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, he gave up full-time work and joined the board of East-West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961. In August 1964, he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company (now Toll IPEC), which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC-4 Skymasters; the government rejected the proposal later that year. Along with Arthur Coles, Brain was a guest {{at the opening of}} TAA's new headquarters at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with adventurer Dick Smith, who was about to launch an expedition to recover the Kookaburra from the Tanami Desert. Smith was keen to get directions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had found the missing plane in 1929, in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the [...] "cap and goggles" [...] era. He rediscovered the Kookaburra in August that year [...] "exactly where Lester Brain had said...Lester was completely chuffed when I got back and told him I'd found the Kookaburra thanks to his directions and how thankful I was that, despite everyone else's suggestions, I'd taken Lester's advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, police searched several {{properties}} in Joplin, Missouri {{associated with a}} local photographer and businessman {{in connection with the}} West Mesa cases.

The easy option would be the other one. To do what Enrique does you need extreme intellectual abilities and extreme emotional commitment. He takes the perfectly-laid, common foundations, defined by tradition, and on them builds with all the conceivable potential of flamenco." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buckley was {{particularly}} concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB were doing was morally equivalent. He wrote in his memoirs, [...] "To say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices {{is the equivalent of}} saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{transmission}} of the first episode, the BBC's Head of Drama Sydney Newman personally congratulated Peter Bryant on what he had seen, which Bryant later recalled: [...] "Coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> created Doctor Who that was the ultimate compliment, even more so seeing as {{it was my first}} job as producer." [...] However, the serial also attracted controversy. On 26 September 1967, Kit Pedler appeared on the BBC series Talkback, hosted by David Coleman, to defend the serial against parents who thought it was too violent.|$|E
2500|$|Hecht {{wrote the}} first {{screenplay}} for Ian Fleming's first novel, Casino Royale. Although the final screenplay and film {{was made into a}} comedy spoof, Hecht's version was written as a straight Bond adventure, states spy novelist Jeremy Duns, who recently discovered the original lost scripts. According to Duns, Hecht's version included elements hard to imagine in a film adaptation, adding that [...] "these drafts are a master-class in thriller-writing, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> arguably perfected the form with Notorious." [...] Hecht wrote that he has [...] "never had more fun writing a movie", and felt the James Bond character was cinema's first [...] "gentleman superman" [...] in a long time, as opposed to Hammett and Chandler's [...] "roughneck supermen".|$|E

2500|$|Allin, {{it must be}} stressed, was a planter, {{and neither}} an indentured nor enslaved worker, and the [...] "freedom and honour" [...] he sought was {{independence}} rather than manumission. Neither was Allin of noble blood, nor was his cause against Willoughby based on love. Therefore, {{the extent to which}} he provides a model for Oroonoko is limited more to his crime and punishment than to his plight. However, if Behn left Surinam in 1663, then she could have kept up with matters in the colony by reading the Exact Relation that Willoughby had printed in London in 1666, and seen in the extraordinary execution a barbarity to graft onto her villain, Byam, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> might have been her real employer, Willoughby.|$|E
2500|$|While {{making the}} Bond films, Connery also starred in other {{acclaimed}} {{films such as}} Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964) and The Hill (1965). Having played Bond six times Connery's global popularity was such that he shared a Golden Globe Henrietta Award with Charles Bronson for [...] "World Film Favorite – Male" [...] in 1972. Apart <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> Would Be King and The Wind and the Lion, both released in 1975, and Robin and Marian (1976) where he played Robin Hood and starred opposite Audrey Hepburn who played Maid Marian, most of Connery's successes {{in the next decade}} were as part of ensemble casts in films such as Murder on the Orient Express (1974) with Vanessa Redgrave and John Gielgud, and A Bridge Too Far (1977) co-starring Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Olivier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{killing of}} Ebru Soykan, a {{prominent}} transgender human rights activist, on March 10, 2009, [...] "shows a continuing climate of violence {{based on gender}} identity that authorities should urgently take steps to combat," [...] Human Rights Watch said on 13 March 2009. News reports and members of a Turkish human rights group said that an assailant stabbed and killed Ebru, 28, in {{her home in the}} center of Istanbul. Members of Lambda Istanbul, which works for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and transsexual (LGBTT) people, told Human Rights Watch that in the last month Ebru had asked the Prosecutor's Office for protection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had beaten her on several occasions and threatened to kill her. Lambda Istanbul was told that a few weeks ago police detained the man but released him two hours later. The same man is under police custody as the murder suspect.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Guardian in 2013, Jon Boone termed Sharif's [...] "desire for {{improved}} diplomatic and {{trade relations with}} India and a reduced role of the army in national life has won over some liberal-minded Pakistanis who were once suspicious of the religious leanings {{of a man who}} tried to introduce Sharia Law in the late 90s before a military coup sent him into exile in Saudi Arabia". In another column, The Guardian described Sharif's first two terms in the 1990s as [...] "(he) locked up journalists, tried to enact sharia law and sacked the supreme court" [...] adding that [...] "a billionaire steel magnate, he was dogged by allegations that some of his wealth had come through kickbacks on government contracts, illegal write-offs of loans and blatant tax evasion". Further adding that [...] "but old foes and longstanding friends say Sharif is a changed man" [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> [...] "went into politics in the late 1970s to defend family interests after his father's metal factories were nationalised by the PPP".|$|E
