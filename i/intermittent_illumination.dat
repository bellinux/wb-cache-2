30|$|The {{increased}} PC {{density and}} the enhanced photoelectrochemical activity {{can also be}} ascribed to {{a large number of}} electron-hole pairs formed under the illumination of the light around 380 nm the energy of whose photons is nearly resonant with the band gap of ZnO. As described above, however, the presence of the ZnO coatings on the TiO 2 NTs results in a red shift of absorption edge and allows the ZnO-coated TiO 2 NTs to absorb visible light. In order to investigate the influence of the ZnO coverage on the photoelectrochemical activity under visible illumination, PC measurements were also performed under <b>intermittent</b> visible <b>illumination</b> with a wavelength cutoff of 420 nm. Although the corresponding PC densities are generally lower than those obtained under the illumination with the wavelength cutoff of 380 nm, the ZnO-covered TiO 2 NTs present enhanced photoelectrochemical activities compared with the bare TiO 2 NTs. For the 10 -cycle ZnO-covered TiO 2 NTs, in particular, a significant enhancement of photoelectrochemical activity is observed. The PC density increases from ~ 1.4 μA/cm 2 for the bare TiO 2 NTs to ~ 2.2 μA/cm 2 for the 10 -cycle ZnO/TiO 2 NTs, as shown in Fig. 9 b. An increase of nearly 60 % in photoelectrochemical activity is therefore obtained for the TiO 2 NTs covered by a 10 -cycle deposit of ZnO, or by a 2.1 -nm ZnO coating, compared with the bare TiO 2 NTs. In contrast, the 25 -cycle ZnO/TiO 2 NTs just show a slight increase of PC density compared with the bare TiO 2 NTs. One of the factors unfavorable for the enhancement in the photoelectrochemical activity of the 25 -cycle ZnO/TiO 2 NTs should be the thicker ZnO coating, which presents a longer pathway for the generated electrons to migrate to the TiO 2 surface and the generated holes to the ZnO surface, and hence increases the recombination of electrons and holes, not conducive to the separation of electrons and holes. Apparently, the higher photoelectrochemical activity of the 10 -cycle ZnO/TiO 2 NTs is consistent with the suppressed recombination of electrons and holes in the heterogeneous nanostructures composed of TiO 2 NTs and ultrathin ZnO coating. The above results suggest that from the view of enhancing photoelectrochemical activity, ZnO coatings of about 2 nm in thickness are optimal for heterostructured ZnO/TiO 2 NTs [19, 40, 48, 49].|$|R

Extraction of useful information without viewing or exposing inside details of an environment through an active vision system is proposed. Reasoning based conclusions are drawn for optimum searching. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using an experiment. Three reasoning criteria are developed and experimentally tested for identifying the states of seats, States of seat can be vacant state, occupied state, or a state with an object placed on the seat. First criterion basically uses binary image analysis and {{with the introduction of}} white reference value it can also be applied for environments where there are <b>intermittent</b> variations of <b>illumination</b> level. Second criterion is based on the analysis of color image and it can be basically used for identifying objects placed on seats. Third criterion based on the analysis of intensity image.

40|$|When the {{illumination}} of {{a visual}} field is interrupted with sufficiently high frequency, {{it appears to}} the human eye as continuous. Talbot (1834) first {{pointed out that the}} brightness of such a field now corresponds to the original illumination multiplied by the fraction which the actual duration of illumination is of the total duration of a complete cycle of illumination and darkness. Thus, a reduction in the time of action of the light is equivalent visually to a corresponding reduction in its intensity. Talbot, himself, records no measurements in terms of which the validity of his law may be judged, though his paper clearly indicates that he made such measurements. These were first given by Plateau (1835) who compared the brightness of rotating white discs containing black sectors with the brightness of the same white cardboard at different distances from a source of light. At equal brightness, he found that the square of the distance of the rotating disc from the light is to the square of the distance of the white paper as the angle of the white sector is to 360 °. The measurements are limited, but adequate. Later, Helmholtz (1865) described several additional ways of demonstrating Talbot's law, and appears to have tried them; but he gives no measurements.

Corresponding energy charges were 0. 85 ± 0. 02 and 0. 81 ± 0. 02.

Bacterial inactivation in the absence of catalyst was more affected than that with catalyst when increasing light intensity from 400 to 1000 W/m(2). TiO 2 concentrations higher than 1 g/l do not significantly increase the initial inactivation rate for both intensities. However, at 1000 W/m(2) a modification of TiO 2 concentration ranging between 0. 25 and 1. 5 g/l did not affect the total inactivation time, as with 400 W/m(2). Water turbidity negatively affects the photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria. TiO 2 immobilized on Nafion((R)) membranes inactivates E. coli with efficiencies close to those observed for bacterial suspension containing the same concentration of suspended TiO 2. For fixed TiO 2 on glass, the dose (W min/m(2)) necessary for the total inactivation decreases by increasing the fixed TiO 2 amount. Fixed TiO 2 P- 25 was more active to photocatalytic inactivation when compared with immobilized rutile and anatase. However fixed rutile enhances E. coli inactivation as anatase. The effect of temperature and turbidity were made using wastewater sample. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|To date, optical {{lithography}} {{has been extensively}} used for in situ patterning of hydrogel structures in a scale range from hundreds of microns to a few millimeters. The two main limitations which prevent smaller feature sizes of hydrogel structures are (1) the upper glass layer of a microchip maintains a large spacing (typically 525 mu m) between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, leading to diffraction of UV light {{at the edges of}} mask patterns, (2) diffusion of free radicals and monomers results in irregular polymerization near the illumination interface. In this work, we present a simple approach to enable the use of {{optical lithography}} to fabricate hydrogel arrays with a minimum feature size of 4 mu m inside closed microchips. To achieve this, we combined two different techniques. First, the upper glass layer of the microchip was thinned by mechanical polishing to reduce the spacing between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, and thereby the diffraction of UV light at the edges of mask patterns. The polishing process reduces the upper layer thickness from similar to 525 to similar to 100 mu m, and the mean surface roughness from 20 to 3 nm. Second, we developed an <b>intermittent</b> <b>illumination</b> technique consisting of short illumination periods followed by relatively longer dark periods, which decrease the diffusion of monomers. Combination of these two methods allows for fabrication of 0. 4 x 10 (6) sub- 10 mu m sized hydrogel patterns over large areas (cm(2)) with high reproducibility (similar to 98. 5 % patterning success). The patterning method is tested with two different types of photopolymerizing hydrogels: polyacrylamide and polyethylene glycol diacrylate. This method enables in situ fabrication of well-defined hydrogel patterns and presents a simple approach to fabricate 3 -D hydrogel matrices for biomolecule separation, biosensing, tissue engineering, and immobilized protein microarray application...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has indicated that the pupil diameter (PD) in humans varies with their affective states. However, this signal has not been fully investigated for affective sensing purposes in human-computer interaction systems. This {{may be due to the}} dominant separate effect of the pupillary light reflex (PLR), which shrinks the pupil when light intensity increases. ^ In this dissertation, an adaptive interference canceller (AIC) system using the H∞ time-varying (HITV) adaptive algorithm was developed to minimize the impact of the PLR on the measured pupil diameter signal. The modified pupil diameter (MPD) signal, obtained from the AIC was expected to reflect primarily the pupillary affective responses (PAR) of the subject. Additional manipulations of the AIC output resulted in a processed MPD (PMPD) signal, from which a classification feature, PMPDmean, was extracted. This feature was used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM), for the identification of stress states in the subject from whom the pupil diameter signal was recorded, achieving an accuracy rate of 77. 78 %. ^ The advantages of affective recognition through the PD signal were verified by comparatively investigating the classification of stress and relaxation states through features derived from the simultaneously recorded galvanic skin response (GSR) and blood volume pulse (BVP) signals, with and without the PD feature. The discriminating potential of each individual feature extracted from GSR, BVP and PD was studied by analysis of its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve found for the PMPDmean feature encompassed the largest area (0. 8546) of all the single-feature ROCs investigated. ^ The encouraging results seen in affective sensing based on pupil diameter monitoring were obtained in spite of <b>intermittent</b> <b>illumination</b> increases purposely introduced during the experiments. Therefore, these results confirmed the benefits of using the AIC implementation with the HITV adaptive algorithm to isolate the PAR and the potential of using PD monitoring to sense the evolving affective states of a computer user. ...|$|E

The use of patterned hydrogels in closed fluidic microchips for different research fields depends crucially on the ease and accessibility of their fabrication technology.

As the first major application of hydrogels, we describe a novel method for concurrent continuous flow fractionation and purification of DNA fragments in a microfluidic device filled with agarose gel. We exploit the variation in the field-dependent mobility of DNA molecules with DNA length for the fractionation. Since this new mechanism can be applied using agarose gel, it provides a low-cost, robust, and versatile separation matrix. We propose and demonstrate an in vitro microfluidic cell culture platform that consists of periodic 3 D hydrogel structures as the second major application of hydrogels. The unique architecture of the microchip enables culturing of human intestine cells, which spontaneously grow into 3 D structures on the 3 rd day of cell culturing. On the 8 th day of culture, Caco- 2 cells are co-cultured for 36 hours with intestinal bacteria E. coli, which adhered to the cells without affecting the cell viability. Different compartment geometries lead to a difference in the proliferation and cell spread profile of Caco- 2 cells.

Gross, and C. J. Arntzen. 1976. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 175 : 64 - 70) that pea seedlings which {{were exposed to}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>illumination</b> contained incompletely developed chloroplasts. These plastids were photosynthetically competent, but did not contain grana. We now demonstrate that the incompletely developed plastids have a smaller photosynthetic unit size; this is primarily due {{to the absence of}} a major light-harvesting pigment-protein complex which is present in the mature membranes. Upon exposure of intermittent- light seedlings to continuous white light for periods up to 48 h, a ligh-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex was inserted into the chloroplast membrane with a concomitant appearance of grana stacks and an increase in photosynthetic unit size. Plastid membranes from plants grown under intermediate light were examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The membrane particles on both the outer (PF) and inner (EF) leaflets of the thylakoid membrane were found to be randomly distributed. The particle density of the PF fracture face was approx. four times that of the EF fracture face. While only small changes in particle density were observed during the greening process under continuous light, major changes in particle size were noted, particularly in the EF particles of stacked regions (EFs) of the chloroplast membrane. Both the changes in particle size and an observed aggregation of the EF particles into the newly stacked regions of the membrane were correlated with the insertion of light-harvesting pigment- protein into the membrane. Evidence is presented for identification of the EF particles as the morphological equivalent of a "complete" photosystem II complex, consisting of a phosochemically active "core" complex surrounded by discrete aggregates of the light-harvesting pigment protein. A model demonstrating the spatial relationships of photosystem I, photosystem II, and the light-harvesting complex in the chloroplast membrane is presented...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels are {{considered}} to be in the class of smart materials that find application in diagnostic, therapeutic,and fundamental science tools for miniaturized total analysis systems. In this thesis, the focus is on three major applications of patterned hydrogels, which are explored as an alternative strategy to expensive and low throughput systems for preparative DNA fractionation, in vitro compartmentalization of human gut epithelium, and desalination by microelectrodialysis. The use of patterned hydrogels in closed fluidic microchips or different research fields depends crucially on the ease and accessibility of their fabrication technology. In this work, two simple fabrication procedures are developed to pattern hydrogel microarrays. First, <b>intermittent</b> <b>illumination</b> is applied on mechanically polished microchips or the photopatterning of hydrogels. Second, capillary pressure barriers are used for controlling the position of the liquid-air meniscus in microchip channels, allowing the subsequent patterning of hydrogels by photopolymerization and thermo-gelation. Both fabrication techniques differ from previous studies in terms of versatility and high reproducibility. Preparative fractionation and purification of small-sized DNA fragments play an important role for second-generation sequencing and personalized medicine, and it is the first major application of hydrogels explored. We describe a novel method for concurrent continuous flow fractionation and purification of DNA fragments in a microfluidic device filled with agarose gel. The innovation of this work is twofold. Firstly, a new principle for continuous flow DNA fractionation is demonstrated. We exploit the variation in the field-dependent mobility of DNA molecules with DNA length for the fractionation, which is a separation mechanism that has hitherto gone unnoticed. Secondly, since this new mechanism can be applied using agarose gel, it provides a low-cost, robust, and versatile separation matrix. The theoretical advancement in combination with the practical advantages can lead to new developments in the gield of sample preparation of biological samples. Baseline fractionation of a 0. 5 - 10 kbp DNA ladder is achieved within 2 minutes, which is ~ 15 times faster than in commercially available devices. Furthermore, the gel technology is easily adaptable; for example, changing the gel type can enable the fractionation of protein molecules. Thus, the microfluidic device is of broad interest for second generation sequencing and clinical diagnosis applications. The second major application of hydrogels reported in this thesis is the use of multicompartmental hydrogel arrays for 3 D culturing of human intestine epithelial cells. Engineering in vitro microenvironments that mimic in vivo tissue systems is crucial for improving our understanding of tissue physiology, as well as curtailing the high costs and complexities associated with the existing techniques. We propose and demonstrate an in vitro microfluidic cell culture platform that consists of periodic 3 D hydrogel structures. The compartmentalized nature of the microchip architecture and fluid delivery enable culturing of human intestine cells which spontaneously grow into 3 D structures on the 3 rd day of cell culturing. On the 8 th day of culture, Caco- 2 cells are co-cultured for 36 hours with intestinal bacteria E. coli, which adhered to the cells without affecting the cell viability. Continuous fluidic perfusion also enables the preliminary screening of chloramphenicol treatment on the intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, we find that different compartment geometries with large and small hydrogel interfaces lead to a difference in the proliferation and cell spread profile of Caco- 2 cells. The microchip enables facile fluidic control that allows dynamic regulation of culture conditions. Microelectrodialysis is explored as the last major application of hydrogels in this thesis. Common methods used to construct microelectrodialysis devices rely on incorporation of membranes into microchips, which is challenging in terms of robustness, consistency, and ease of fabrication. Hydrogels are more promising candidates for desalination by electrodialysis, than membranes due to their ion selective and hydrophilic matrix, which is also versatile, inexpensive, and easily tailorable. Patterning ion selective hydrogels at small scales is therefore used to miniaturize the electrodialysis process in microfluidic devices, and subsequently provides more insight into the ion transport phenomena. In this work, we firstly show that parallel streams of concentrated and ion-depleted water are formed in continuous flow when a potential difference is applied across the microchip containing alternating rows of patterned cation- and anion-selective hydrogels. The device could remove approximately 75 % of the 1 mM sodium chloride salt introduced via the inlet streams. We demonstrate different currents and flow rates in the microchip for desalination purposes. Secondly, the microchip enables ion transport visualization in the ion selective hydrogels and microchannels when a charged fluorescent dye is utilized. For sufficiently high potential differences, vortex formation is observed near the hydrogel-liquid interfaces, contributing to an enhanced convective transport towards the hydrogels in the overlimiting current regime...|$|E
