50|$|The Dragon Fire {{system is}} {{designed}} {{to be able to use}} all NATO types of rifled and smoothbore 120 mm mortar ammunition. However, the USMC awarded Raytheon a contract to design, develop and demonstrate a new 120mm long-range, guided-mortar munition for use with the M327 mortar. The new Precision Extended Range Munition (PERM) is expected to be ready for a live-fire demonstration by the summer of 2015. The 120mm rifled mortar PERM round will give the EFSS a reach of 17 km, with a CEP of 20 m. The prototype PERM rounds have a <b>GPS</b> <b>antenna</b> and small fins, canards, that provide lift and extend the range of the weapon. The Marine Corps acquisition program performed a shoot-off of the prototype mortar rounds developed by Raytheon and ATK. In December 2015, the Marine Corps awarded a five-year contract to Raytheon Missile Systems to deliver about 4,300 rounds. Each round, weighing 35 pounds each, costs $18,000 each, about $16,000 more than the non-precision rounds.|$|E
5000|$|From 2003 to 2006 DOLLx8 {{was also}} {{developed}} for embedded systems within aviation through Aeronautical Software and Technology Lab (ASLT) [...] in Thailand where ASLT developed a DOLLx8 streaming {{system for the}} transfer of GPS-, navigation (navaid), terrain, and MEMS gyroscope data for Electronic Map Display (EMD) and Primary Flight Display (PFD). The system could then receive GPS data in NMEA and binary formats, along with other aircraft data and transmit this along with the flight plan, terrain and navigation data so that both instruments could use the same flight data over one or two DOLLx8 data lines. The advantage of such technology was that the aircraft or helicopters would need only one <b>GPS</b> <b>antenna</b> for two or more GPS based instruments. The streaming system that was developed back then by ASLT was also used in later versions {{and is now a}} permanent part of DOLLx8 in connection with sensor streaming technologies and GSM data transfer via GPRS.|$|E
50|$|Sharipov {{conducted}} {{his second}} career spacewalk on 28 March 2005. The spacewalk, in Russian Orlan suits using the airlock of the Pirs Docking Compartment began at 1:25 a.m. EST. After opening the hatch and assembling equipment, Sharipov and astronaut Leroy Chiao {{moved to the}} small-diameter forward end of the Zvezda module. There the two spacewalkers installed the final three antennas on the Zvezda Service Module of a six-antenna set for the resupply spacecraft ATV. Installation of the antennas and their associated cabling took about two hours. Sharipov and Chiao also installed a Global Positioning System (<b>GPS)</b> <b>antenna</b> for the ATV. During this spacewalk, Sharipov and Chiao deployed a small Russian experiment called Nanosatellite. Sharipov deployed it from the ladder at Pirs, giving it a push in the direction opposite the direction the ISS was traveling. The tiny satellite was about a foot long, weighs 11 pounds and contained a transmitter. The two spacewalkers activated the satellite before leaving the Pirs airlock and stowed it {{on the outside of}} the docking compartment. The object of the experiment was to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite operations and develop new attitude system sensors. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 30 minutes.|$|E
