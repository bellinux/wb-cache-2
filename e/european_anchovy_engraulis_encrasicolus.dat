40|$|AbstractAnisakid {{nematodes}} {{belonging to}} the species Anisakis pegreffii are distributed {{in a wide variety}} of fishes from the Mediterranean Sea and they are known to cause the human zoonosis anisakiasis. The present study investigated, for the first time, the response of A.  pegreffii larvae (identified to species level by allozymes and mtDNA cox 2 sequence analysis) to the storage temperature of <b>European</b> <b>anchovies,</b> <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus.</b> The larval motility of A.  pegreffii was studied in 1300 fish specimens, captured from a highly infested area (FAO 37. 2. 1, 43 ° 8 ′N, 14 ° 16 ′E), maintained under different temperatures (2  °C, 5  °C, 7  °C), and examined at different time intervals (immediately after fishing, 24  h, 48  h and 72  h). Parasitological analysis was carried out with the UV-press method. The results showed that the increase of infection values with A.  pegreffii in the fillets of anchovies was statistically positively related to the increase of the temperature (at 5  °C and 7  °C) and time of storage (after 24  h, 48  h, and 72  h). Accordingly, a significant statistical correlation between the increasing of the worm burden in the fillets and a decreasing of A.  pegreffii in the viscera was observed. In contrast, those fish constantly maintained at 2  °C showed no statistically significant variation in infection either in the viscera or the fillets, after 24, 48 and 72  h. In the same batches of anchovies, larvae of the non-zoonotic nematode parasite Hysterothylacium aduncum (identified to the species level by ITS rDNA sequences analysis) were found, but they were never observed infecting the musculature of the anchovies. Our results suggest that temperature plays an important role in the post-mortem motility of A.  pegreffii larvae in anchovies. In addition, the presence of A.  pegreffii in the fillets inspected immediately after their capture indicates that intra-vitam migration may also occur. As a consequence, the importance of the adoption of rules to prevent human anisakiasis, as the deep freezing to − 20  °C for 24  h, was underlined...|$|R

Lebanese Science Journal, 17 (1) : 77 - 92. 			This study evaluated diet variation of <b>European</b> <b>anchovy</b> <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> in productive and oligotrophic areas. The diet of the European anchovy was studied at 13 different sites along its geographic distribution range. In all sites, the diet was mainly based on copepods that represented 33 to 98 % of the prey identified and were found in over 80 % of the stomachs analyzed. The dominant copepod species and the various secondary preys such as ostracods, gastropods, and eggs varied among locations. Multivariate analyses (AFC, CAH, nMDS) distinguished three groups according to sites: group 1 in the Northwestern Mediterranean, Atlantic, Channel/North Sea; group 2 in the Algero-Provençal Basin (Ghazaouet, Bénisaf and Bejaia); and group 3 in the Eastern Mediterranean (Lebanon and Turkey). The differences among groups {{were based on the}} presence of specific prey types, such as, zooplankton, cyprid larvae, barnacles in the first group, bivalves and amphipods in the second group, and ostracods, mysids, and euphausiids in the third group. These groupings reflected the dissimilarities of hydrographic characteristics and biological productivity between regions.

Anchovy was generally most abundant, reaching 13 852 larvae 10 [*]m− 2 in 2003 and occurred in more stations compared to round sardinella. Despite the spawning of both species occurring across the entire gulf, the general spatial distribution of their larvae was different, with European anchovy larvae occupying the entire gulf and round sardinella larvae mainly concentrated at offshore stations.

Stocks have fluctuated greatly over the past few decades, and the Adriatic fishery collapsed in 1987.

In addition, estimates of effective population size (Ne) are much smaller than those expected in a fishes with large population census sizes (Nc). Estimates of Ne indicate low effective population sizes, even before the population collapse.

Therefore, anchovy populations may be more vulnerable to fishery effort and environmental change than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|Fish larvae were {{collected}} in two surveys, carried out {{at the beginning of}} July 2002 and 2003 in Kavala Gulf (northern Aegean Sea) aimed at studying ichthyoplankton species assemblages and station groupings. The similarity dendrograms revealed the existence of four species assemblages associated with three station groups in 2002 and five species assemblages associated with four station groups in 2003. These groupings were confirmed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis. Analysis of similarity showed that the station groups were significantly different for 2002 (global R= 0. 748; P< 0. 001) and 2003 (global R= 0. 931; P< 0. 001).
