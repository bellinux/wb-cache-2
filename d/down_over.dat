5|$|McCudden was now {{closing in}} on the tally of Albert Ball who was {{credited}} with 44 enemy aircraft. A further nine in January 1918 elevated his tally from 37 to 46. In February, 11 aircraft brought his tally to 57—four fell on the 16th. After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th—a Hannover CL.III—but it went <b>down</b> <b>over</b> enemy lines under control as McCudden's guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} the new year. He dispatched a two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving {{out of the sun}} to blind the gunner, he shot it <b>down</b> <b>over</b> the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy.

5|$|North from Nethermost Pike is the {{depression}} of Swallow Scarth, above {{the head of}} Nethermost Cove. From here the ridge climbs again, turning to the west as the long plateau of Helvellyn top is reached. Southwards the ridge steps <b>down</b> <b>over</b> High Crag, and narrows as it swings east around Ruthwaite Cove to Dollywaggon Pike. A heavily eroded path runs along the ridge, but actually bypasses the top of Nethermost Pike to the west, as it leads to Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then <b>down</b> <b>over</b> steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot <b>down</b> <b>over</b> Goražde by Serb forces.

5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary {{quite a bit}} in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning <b>down</b> <b>over</b> 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E
