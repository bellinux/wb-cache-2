5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called <b>isozymes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as <b>isozymes)</b> available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase <b>isozymes</b> in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E

40|$|GA 3 stimulated {{incorporation}} of radioactive methionine into an acid phosphatase <b>isozyme</b> possessing an isoelectric pH at 4. 0 (pi 4 <b>isozyme).</b> This effect of GA 3 was completely inhibited by cycloheximide, {{but not by}} cordycepin. The results suggest the existence of preformed mRNA coding for pi 4 <b>isozyme</b> in the wheat aleurone layer and the stimulation of its translation by GA 3. Key words: Acid phosphatase — De novo synthesis (acid phosphatase) — Gibberellic acid — <b>Isozyme</b> (acid phosphatase) — Triticum aestivum — Wheat seed. We have reported that GA 3 enhances acid phosphatase activity in the aleurone layers of wheat half-seeds by causing {{the formation of the}} acidic enzyme (Akiyama and Suzuki 1980, 1981). We demonstrated that the increased activity is largely due to an <b>isozyme</b> of pi 4. 0 and that the increase of this particular <b>isozyme</b> is also found in the endosperm of germinating wheat seeds (Akiyama et al. 1981). We developed an efficient procedure for fractionation of the pi 4 <b>isozyme</b> and used it to conduct experiments to answer the question of whether this <b>isozyme</b> is synthesized de novo or activated in GA 3 -treated wheat half-seeds...|$|R
30|$|Human {{carbonic}} anhydrase <b>isozyme</b> II (hCAII) is {{the most}} efficient <b>isozyme</b> in CO 2 hydration and is a highly abundant CA <b>isozyme</b> in cells (Supuran and Scozzafava 2000). Furthermore, hCAII is the only <b>isozyme</b> so far reported in which its overexpression can complement the growth defect of the yeast Δnce 103 null mutant strain (Clark et al. 2004). Thus, in this study, we aimed to develop a novel yeast-based assay in a 96 -well format for the high throughput screening of CAIs against hCAII.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of hammerhead shark {{evolution is}} that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a requiem shark ancestor, and later {{gave rise to}} species with larger cephalofoils. Under this interpretation, the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead, as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic research based on <b>isozymes,</b> mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA have found the opposite pattern, with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family. This result supports the counterintuitive idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil. It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic (including all descendants of a single ancestor). The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged {{from the rest of}} the hammerheads some 15–20 million years ago during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD <b>isozymes</b> are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E

25|$|Whilst <b>isozymes</b> may {{be almost}} {{identical}} in function, they may differ in other ways. In particular, amino acid substitutions {{that change the}} electric charge of the enzyme (such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid) are simple to identify by gel electrophoresis, and this forms {{the basis for the}} use of <b>isozymes</b> as molecular markers. To identify <b>isozymes,</b> a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer, and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis. Historically, this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch, but acrylamide gels provide better resolution.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the karyotype of the interspecific fusants of twoPleurotus species. Auxotrophic mutants derived from the cultivated strain ofP. ostreatus andP. cornucopiae were used. Protoplasts were fused electrically, and the fusants were selected under auxotrophic complementation. Esterase <b>isozyme</b> analysis showed that several fusants had <b>isozyme</b> bands originating from both parental strains, and others had unilateral <b>isozyme</b> bands. The fusant that had expressed <b>isozyme</b> bands of both parental strains showed chromosomal DNA bands of both of the parental strains in pulsedfield gel electrophoresis analysis. Despite the above results, the chromosomal composition of the fusants obtained by the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis did not exhibit all of the bands of both fusion parents.|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic control}} of eight <b>isozyme</b> loci {{revealed}} by starch gel electrophoresis was studied through {{the analysis of}} three progenies derived from four tetraploid cultivars of Solanum tuberosum (groups Andigena and Tuberosum). Duplicate gene expression was found in seven (Got-A, Got-B, Pgd-C, Pgi-B, Pgm-A, Pgm-B and Pox-C) <b>isozyme</b> loci. In another <b>isozyme</b> gene (Adh-A), the parental genotypes were not adequate to distinguish between a monogenic or a digenic model of genetic control. Tetrasomic inheritance was demonstrated in four (Got-A, Got-B, Pgd-C and Pgi-B) <b>isozyme</b> loci. In the remaining duplicate genes, the parental genotypes precluded discrimination between disomic or tetrasomic models. Tetrasomic segregations of the chromosomal type were generally found; however, the <b>isozyme</b> phenotypes shown by three descendants from selfing cv. Katahdin indicate the occurrence of chromatid segregations, although aneuploidy cannot be ruled out.

25|$|Buprenorphine is metabolised by the liver, via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 {{seems to}} be involved) <b>isozymes</b> of the {{cytochrome}} P450 enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation). The glucuronidation of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, and that of norbuprenorphine by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into the bile. The elimination half-life of buprenorphine is 20–73 hours (mean 37). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, there is no risk of accumulation in people with renal impairment.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{origin of}} {{cultivated}} papaya is not clear. Wild relatives of papaya (Carica papaya) from central southern America were investigated using <b>isozyme</b> and RAPD analysis. Seven other species (including six from the genus Carica) {{were found to}} be relatively distant from papaya providing no indication of the genetic origin of papaya. <b>Isozyme</b> and RAPD data gave similar measures of genetic similarity within this group. C. papaya was about 70 % dissimilar to the other Carica species by both methods. The other Carica species had average dissimilarities around 50 %. Two species, C. pubescens and C. stipulata were much closer to each other with similarities of 87 % by <b>isozyme</b> analysis and 82 % by RAPD analysis. Although both methods gave similar measures for genetic distance the large number of RAPD markers available made RAPD analysis more reliable for analysis of the extremes (e. g. closely related taxa may show no <b>isozyme</b> differences and distant taxa may show no <b>isozyme</b> similarities) ...|$|R

Although G. soja is agronomically undesirable, it {{is a potential}} source of new germplasm for breeding programs. Marker loci {{may be useful in}} an introgression program to enhance the recovery of desirable traits of the cultivated species by decreasing the number of segregants that must be evaluated in the field. <b>Isozyme</b> loci have a number of characteristics that make them desirable as markers. Before developing marker-based selection schemes, it is necessary to understand the relationships that exist between <b>isozyme</b> loci and genes involved in the expression of the desired traits. Two crosses between G. max and G. soja parents were used to study the association between <b>isozyme</b> marker loci and quantitative traits. The parents possessed different alleles at six <b>isozyme</b> loci for Cross 1 (A 80 - 244036 x PI 326581) and at eight <b>isozyme</b> loci for Cross 2 (A 81 - 157007 x PI 342618 A). A total of 480 lines from the two crosses were evaluated in two replications at two locations for time of maturity (MAT), lodging, plant height, vining, plant type, seed yield, content of seed protein, oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. Lines were grouped in locus classes, from 0 to 5, according to the number of loci homozygous for the G. soja alleles they possessed. Within each locus class, {{there were a number of}} <b>isozyme</b> genotypes, each represented by five random lines.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the genetic {{diversity}} among the major cuban rice cultivars was conducted using <b>isozyme,</b> RAPD and AFLP markers. Polymorphisms were detected for esterases, peroxidases, alcohol dehydrogenases and polyphenoloxidases systems; 21 RAPD primers and four AFLP primer combinations. Heterozygosity arithmetic mean value (Hav(p)), the effective multiplex ratio (EMR) and the marker index (MI), were calculated for <b>isozyme,</b> RAPD and AFLP markers. The mean value of genetic similarity among the different varieties was 0. 92 for <b>isozyme,</b> 0. 73 for RAPD and 0. 58 for AFLP analyses. Thus, AFLP were able to detect polymorphisms with higher efficiency than RAPD (+ 15 %) and <b>isozyme</b> (+ 34 %). Data from the <b>isozyme,</b> RAPD and AFLP analyses were used to compute matrices of genetic similarities. The efficiency of the UPGMA for the estimation of genetic relatedness among varieties was supported by cophenetic correlation coefficients. The resulting values indicated that the distortion level for the estimated similarities was minimal. The correlation coefficients obtained by the Mantel matrix correspondence test, which {{was used to compare}} the cophenetic matrices for the different markers, showed that estimated values of genetic relationship given for <b>isozyme</b> and RAPD markers (r = 0. 89), as well as for AFLP and RAPD markers (r = 0. 82) were properly related. However, AFLP and <b>isozyme</b> data showed only moderate correlation (r = 0. 63).

Among them, cellulose acetate membrane is currently used in the routine laboratory study because it is simple to handle. The author has been using a Titan III-Iso (cellulose acetate) plate as a supporting medium concurrent with the determination of pNPP/PMP ratio as a supplement. Unsuspected data were obtained which suggested the existence of intestine-type Al-P <b>isozyme</b> by electrophoresis but not by the pNPP/PMP ratio. To explain the discrepancy, an investigation was carried out. It was subsequently found that this phenomenon occurred when CELLOGEL, one kind of cellulose acetate, {{was used as a}} supporting medium, but not with agar gel. Therefore, this phenomenon was peculiar to cellulose acetate membrane. Since the intestine-type of Al-P <b>isozyme</b> is detected sensitively by pNPP/PMP ratio, further study was conducted using column gel filtration to demonstrate another unusual <b>isozyme</b> suspected. As a result, a fraction which has a higher molecular weight relative to the ordinary liver-type II Al-P <b>isozyme</b> was found by gel filtration. This fraction contained Al-P bound to IgG (λ) when studied by enzyme-immunoelectro-phoresis expecting an Al-P bound to other proteins.
