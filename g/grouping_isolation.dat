40|$|A {{study was}} made {{of the effects of the}} {{photoperiod}} on female reproductive activities in grouped and isolated specimens of the hermaphrodite freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Isolation of snails rapidly increased ( 14 days). In comparison with a medium day (MD) (12 hr light/ 12 hr dark), a long day (LD; 16 hr light/ 8 hr dark) stimulated egg production whereas a short day (SD) (8 hr light/ 16 hr dark) lowered egg production. The LD effects were clearer in grouped than in isolated snails, but SD effects were clearer in isolated than in grouped snails. It is argued that the effects of <b>grouping,</b> <b>isolation</b> and photoperiod on egg production are mediated by the neuroendocrine system. It is suggested that the photoperiod plays an important role in the control of the egg laying season. Mating is probably important in the control of fecundity in relation to population densit...|$|E

One year before on 24 May 2000, HRW published the report Small <b>Group</b> <b>Isolation</b> in Turkish Prisons: An Avoidable Disaster. The organization expressed two primary concerns: [...] (1) to the extent the cell-based system is accompanied by an isolation regime that provides prisoners with no access to educational or recreational activities or other sources of mental stimulation, the system may itself amount to ill-treatment, and (2) a regime of isolation that severely limits access to other inmates as well as the outside world may also increase the risk of ill-treatment of prisoners by prison staff.|$|R

These patients are often cared {{in an adult}} supportive care setting where {{the special needs of}} adolescents are not met. Aim: To identify special issues in adolescents with cancer and to determine whether special needs of adolescents are met in an adult cancer setting Materials and Methods: 10 adolescents with cancer were randomly chosen and retrospectively studied for physical, psychoscocial and emotional issues using an internally validated tool. Results: Pain was the most common physical symptom seen in all 10 patients. 3 out of 10 patients were involved in decision making, 3 out of 10 patients had identity issues and 4 out of 10 patients had peer <b>group</b> <b>isolation</b> issues. Only 3 were aware of diagnosis and none were aware of treatment outcomes and mortality. 4 out of 10 had anxiety and depression and 3 out of 10 had body image issues.

Conclusion: The outcomes of the study were in an adult oncology setting there was a poor recognition of key adolescent issues such as sexuality, body image, identity and peer <b>group</b> <b>isolation.</b> The psychosocial supports to these adolescents were minimal and spiritual and existential issues were not explored. The inferences drawn from this study suggested a need for multidisciplinary team approach oriented in handling adolescent care needs and preferably to have a dedicated space that will help the peer group to interact, bond and cope better with the illness...|$|R

The role of nutrition, {{especially}} nucleotide supplementation, {{has become an}} area of intensive research and significant interest in immunomodulation for maintenance of cellular immune responses. The studies presented here evaluate the plausibility of administering nucleotides to obviate immune dysfunction in an Earth-based in vivo analog of microgravity as studied in anti-orthostatic tail suspension (AOS) of mice. Mice were divided into three housing groups: <b>group,</b> <b>isolation,</b> and AOS. Mice were fed either control chow diet (CD), or RNA-, adenine-, or uracil-supplemented CD for the 1 -wk duration of the experiments. In AOS mice, supplemental nucleotides significantly increased in vivo lymph node proliferation and ex vivo lymphoproliferation response to alloantigen and mitogens, respectively, and interleukin- 2 and interferon-gamma production. A lower corticosterone level was observed in uracil-supplemented CD compared with CD. These results suggest that exogenous nucleotide supplementation, especially uracil, of normal diet is beneficial in the maintenance and restoration of the immune response during the microgravity analog conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of fault for analog circuits. A two-dimensional (2 D) fault model is first proposed based on collaborative analysis of supply current and output voltage.

Furthermore, {{in order to reduce}} the difficulty of fault location, an improved fault model in three-dimensional (3 D) complex space is proposed, which achieves a far better fault detection ratio (FDR) against measurement error and parametric tolerance. To address the problem of fault masking in both 2 D and 3 D fault models, this paper proposes an effective design for testability (DFT) method. By adding redundant bypassing-components in the circuit under test (CUT), this method achieves excellent fault isolation ratio (FIR) in ambiguity <b>group</b> <b>isolation.</b> The efficacy of the proposed model and testing method is validated through experimental results provided in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Ultracentrifugal {{studies of}} the α 2 -proteins of normal human serum {{before and after the}} {{addition}} of hemoglobin have revealed three separate and clearly distinguishable patterns based on the three major serum haptoglobin <b>groups.</b> <b>Isolation</b> of the three haptoglobin hemoglobin complexes disclosed characteristic patterns for each group. The heterozygote was found to possess electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal components not seen in either homozygote. Separation of normal human serum, to which hemoglobin had been added, by conventional starch zone electrophoresis resulted in three characteristic patterns which also permitted the ready identification of the serum haptoglobin group. The haptoglobin hemoglobin complex from Group 1 - 1 had the fastest mobility and that of Group 2 - 2 the slowest. The heterozygote Group 2 - 1 had an intermediate mobility. Immunologic differences between the haptoglobin hemoglobin complexes of the three groups could not be detected. Some of the variations in the reported electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal patterns of normal human serum could be reasonably ascribed to the group variation of the haptoglobins in man. The physical studies imply that the proteins characteristic of the heterozygote differ in size and charge from those present in either of the two homozygotes and indicate that the genetic control of the synthesis of the serum haptoglobins is probably exceedingly complex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the clinical relevance of Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus <b>group</b> <b>isolation</b> from clinical samples. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical files of all patients from whom these mycobacteria were isolated between January 1999 and January 2005 and re-identified the isolates by rpoB sequencing. We applied the American Thoracic Society (ATS) diagnostic criteria to establish clinical relevance. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were traced (56 M. chelonae, 25 Mycobacterium abscessus, 8 Mycobacterium massiliense, 6 Mycobacterium bolletii). Most isolates were cultured from pulmonary samples {{in patients with}} pre-existing pulmonary disease. Among patients with pulmonary isolates, 27 % (20 / 74) meets ATS criteria; M. abscessus is most relevant (50 %; 9 / 18), followed by M. massiliense (29 %; 2 / 7), M. bolletii (20 %; 1 / 5) and M. chelonae (18 %; 8 / 44). Extrapulmonary disease presented as disseminated skin disease, eye disease specific for M. chelonae and otomastoiditis for M. abscessus. Treatment, especially for pulmonary M. abscessus disease, yielded limited results. CONCLUSIONS: One-fourth of the patients with pulmonary M. chelonae-abscessus group isolates met the ATS criteria; this percentage differs by species. Species distribution and clinical relevance differ from other regions. M. abscessus isolation in cystic fibrosis patients warrants special attention. Current ATS criteria might be too lenient to diagnose M. chelonae-abscessus group disease...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} isolation on two isolated groups: the young boys in William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, and the backpackers in Alex Garland’s The Beach. Through discussing the novels from different perspectives, such as the circumstances of their <b>isolation,</b> the <b>group</b> constellations and the threats that endanger their lives, {{it is possible to}} draw conclusions regarding the extent to which isolation in itself influences the two groups. The groups are in similar situations, alone on a desert island, but the circumstances under which they became isolated contribute to the different perceptions both groups have of isolated life. The group constellations are also key factors in understanding the influence isolation has on the groups. Both collectives include key individuals such as a strong, dictator-like leader and social outcasts. Regarding the threats that face the groups, the essay discusses two different types of threats: threats that originate from outside the group and threats that originate from within the <b>group.</b> <b>Isolation</b> influences {{the extent to which these}} threats pose a real danger to the collectives. Through comparing the two novels, looking for differences as well as similarities, and relating these to the fact that the groups are isolated it is concluded that isolation in itself plays a major part in the final outcome of the two groups: violence and disintegration.
