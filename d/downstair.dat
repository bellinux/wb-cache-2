2500|$|Richard Barbieri and Colin Edwin met Steven Wilson {{to play on}} a few songs he {{was working}} on. Again, there was an amount of songs written that would {{perfectly}} fit on a double album, but one of these songs saw the light prior {{to the release of}} their second studio album on the Voyage 34 (1992) single, thereafter followed by [...] (1993), and the other material ended up on the Staircase Infinities (1994) EP. Finally, ten tracks were chosen for their next studio album, Up the <b>Downstair</b> (1993), which Melody Maker described as [...] "a psychedelic masterpiece". At the end of 1993, Chris Maitland joined the band for live shows and would later record some drums and percussions for three songs of Porcupine Tree's third studio album, The Sky Moves Sideways (1995), an album that made the press refer them as the [...] "Pink Floyd of the nineties". They did not record as a full band until Signify (1996), the first Porcupine Tree album to be performed entirely by the four members. It contained shorter compositions and less improvisation than its predecessors.|$|E

60|$|Darkness had descended {{before there}} had been time {{to do more than}} shake into the <b>downstair</b> rooms and {{bedrooms}} and be refreshed with the evening meal, but with morning began the survey of the new home.|$|E
6000|$|There was a lease to be signed, and, as soon {{as might}} be, Mr. Bulfinch, the Redcastle solicitor, brought it up, {{and had to be}} entertained at luncheon. While he was waiting in the drawing-room for Mr. Egremont to be made ready for him, he looked with deep {{interest}} on the little heir, whom Ursula presently led off {{to the other end of}} the room to the hoard of <b>downstair</b> toys; and an elaborate camp was under construction, when by the fireside, the Canoness inquired in a low confidential tone, 'May I ask whether you came about a will?' ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{not very}} encouraging, but she was told that she could come every day and sit {{as long as she}} liked in the waiting-room. There were always several girls and women there--a row of them sitting chatting {{together}} on chairs ranged against the wall--house, parlour, and kitchen-maids out of places; and a few others of a better description, modest-looking, well- dressed young women, who came and stood about {{for a few minutes and}} then went away again. Of the girls of this kind Fan alone remained patiently at her post, taking no interest in the conversation of the others, anxious only to avoid their bold inquisitive looks and to keep herself apart from them. Yet their conversation, to anyone wishing to know something of the lights and shadows of <b>downstair</b> life, was instructive and interesting enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} {{the other day}} of having shutters put to all these <b>downstair</b> rooms. Some of them have got them, and some have not; still, even with shutters, burglars can always get in {{if they want to}} do so. They have only to cut round the lock of a door or to make a hole in a panel to give them room to put an arm through and draw back a bolt, and the thing is done. I know that all the silver is locked up every night in the safe, for Ramoo sees to that, and I have never known him neglect anything under his charge. Well, Mark, I don't know that it is any use sitting up longer, we {{have plenty of time to}} talk the matter over; it is four years yet before Millicent comes of age, though, of course, there is nothing to prevent your setting out in quest of the treasure as soon as you like. Still, there is no hurry about it." ...|$|E
50|$|Originally, Staircase Infinities was {{intended}} to be released on a double album version of Up the <b>Downstair</b> but was not completed in time. Up the <b>Downstair</b> was therefore released as a single album in 1993 but was reissued in an expanded version in 2005 (with live drums by Gavin Harrison), this time including the EP Staircase Infinities.|$|E

5000|$|The EP {{was also}} {{released}} by C+S Records in the United States {{under the name}} of Stars Die and included the song [...] "Always Never" [...] from the Up The <b>Downstair</b> album as an extra track.|$|E
50|$|CMJ - Up The <b>Downstair</b> {{retains the}} band's willowy roots in Albion psychedelia but expands the brief, {{dropping}} its cheesy self-consciousness while infusing some contemporary dance auras (from acidic mesmerism to almost funky syncopation) with more 'group-like' interaction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received. AllMusic praised it for [...] "...continuing the excellence of Up the <b>Downstair</b> while achieving a new liquid sense of drama and overall flow.", specifically praising the stand out track [...] "Stars Die".|$|E
5000|$|Staircase Infinities is {{a studio}} EP by British {{progressive}} rock band Porcupine Tree, first released in December 1994 as a limited 2,000-copy 10" [...] vinyl by Lazy Eye and reissued on CD by Blueprint in the UK in October 1995. It contains outtakes from the Up the <b>Downstair</b> sessions.|$|E
50|$|Imaginary Records was an {{independent}} record label based in Heywood, Greater Manchester, England, which specialised mainly in indie rock and post-punk. It {{was started in}} 1985 by Alan Duffy, known for his lyrical contributions to Porcupine Tree's first two albums, On the Sunday of Life and Up the <b>Downstair,</b> and Andy Hopkins.|$|E
50|$|For its seventh year, {{the festival}} honed in on its more {{technological}} side. Three different installations were included at the Middlesex Lounge, including the incredible Lumen Octangula programmed by Theresa Silver. <b>Downstair</b> at the Middle East, meanwhile, featured an LED {{wall behind the}} stage for the first time. Other outstanding technologists participated all week-long. Finally, the riveting and electric performance of the Floating Points live show at The Sinclair for the launch party was a perfect set-up for the week to come.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{full-length}} album, Up the <b>Downstair</b> (though Wilson {{considers it}} the first 'proper' PT album since it was made as such and not simply compiled), was released in 1993 and {{had a very good}} reception, praised by Melody Maker as [...] "a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year". This was the first album to include ex-Japan member, keyboardist Richard Barbieri and Australian-born bassist Colin Edwin. About the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a full band {{for the first time with}} the inclusion of Chris Maitland on drums.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1993 {{the second}} Porcupine Tree album, Up the <b>Downstair,</b> was released, another {{prospective}} double album that was finally slimmed {{down to a}} single record. [...] "Voyage 34" [...] was actually going {{to take up the}} second disc, but it was last decided to be released alone as a single. The album was highly praised, Melody Maker describing it as [...] "a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year." [...] The album continued the fusion of electronic music and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, Richard Barbieri, of 1970s-80s art rock band Japan, and Colin Edwin.|$|E
5000|$|No-Man's debut {{full-length}} release - {{a compilation}} of EP tracks called Lovesighs - An Entertainment - followed in 1992, as did Porcupine Tree's infamous LSD-themed maxi-single [...] "Voyage 34" [...] which made the NME indie chart for six weeks. No-Man also toured England with a six-piece band including three ex-members of the glam-pop band Japan - Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and (most significantly) keyboardist Richard Barbieri. 1993 saw Wilson consolidating his initial success with albums from both Porcupine Tree (Up the <b>Downstair)</b> and No-Man (Loveblows And Lovecries - A Confession). At the end of 1993, Porcupine Tree was launched as a four-piece live band featuring Wilson, Barbieri, bass player Colin Edwin and former No-Man live drummer Chris Maitland.|$|E
5000|$|Tracks 1 through 7, an edited {{version of}} track 10 and tracks 11, 16 and 18 were {{released}} on the band's official debut album, On the Sunday of Life, in 1992. The {{rest of the}} songs except [...] "Sinatra Rape Scene" [...] were released on Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape, a collection of the leftovers from On the Sunday of Life, in 1994, however [...] "Colours Dance Angels Kiss" [...] was stripped of its title, being listed as [...] "Track Eleven", and [...] "Hokey Cokey" [...] was retitled [...] "Execution of the Will of the Marquis de Sade". An edited version of [...] "Sinatra Rape Scene" [...] was released on Up the <b>Downstair,</b> the band's second album, in 1993 under the title [...] "Monuments Burn into Moments".|$|E
50|$|During 2003 Porcupine Tree set {{up their}} own label, Transmission, with an online store hosted by Burning Shed record label. The first release on the Transmission label was a studio session {{recorded}} for XM Radio, Washington, D.C., followed in 2004 by a recording from Polish radio in 2001. The band used the label to issue supplemental content, such as EPs, demos, and live recordings. Additionally, a reissue/remaster campaign also began in 2003, with many of the early albums expanded to double CDs. These reissues included re-recorded/remixed double CD versions of the Up the <b>Downstair,</b> The Sky Moves Sideways and Signify albums, and the reissue of Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, both comprising a CD with a new stereo mix of the album plus a DVD-Audio with a 5.1 surround mix.|$|E
50|$|In late 1993 Barbieri {{joined the}} {{progressive}} rock band Porcupine Tree (having previously played {{as a guest}} performer on the album Up the <b>Downstair).</b> The band released eight studio albums to increasingly greater chart success, and toured in support of many of them. Initially employing many aspects of psychedelic rock, they later transitioned to a more pop oriented style before settling on progressive metal. Their first major success was the album In Absentia, which enjoyed chart success around Europe with sales of over 120,000. The following studio albums Deadwing and Fear of a Blank Planet met even greater success, charting highly worldwide. Increased radio airtime and favourable mainstream magazine reviews and interviews further increased their public exposure. The band transitioned somewhat away from metal with their last album, The Incident, with leader Steven Wilson expressing a desire to enter a different genre. The band members are currently concentrating on solo projects and have no immediate plans {{to work together in}} the future.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{originates}} from {{a single}} track, titled [...] "Voyage 34", {{which was to be}} part of the Porcupine Tree's second studio album, Up the <b>Downstair.</b> Originally a 30-minute track intended to be the second disc of a double album, Wilson eventually decided to release [...] "Voyage 34" [...] independently of the rest of the album. Instead, it was released in two parts, as singles, as [...] "Voyage 34 (Phase 1)" [...] and [...] "Voyage 34 (Phase 2)" [...] in 1992. In 1993, Voyage 34: Remixes was released, containing two remixes of the originals. [...] "Voyage 34 (Phase 3)" [...] was a remix by the British electronic music group Astralasia, while [...] "Voyage 34 (Phase 4)" [...] was a remix by Wilson himself, along with future band member Richard Barbieri. A voice sample of Dead Can Dance's song [...] "As the Bell Rings the Maypole Spins" [...] is repeated throughout all four tracks.|$|E
5000|$|Later that night, Crow {{spends the}} night with Candy {{although}} they don't have sex. Early the next day, Melissa wakes the two by playing a flute underneath Candy's window. The three head to yet another club from there. Bones and Geoff show up and Bones, who has become jealous of the attention that Candy is showing to Crow, elbows Crow {{in the back of}} the head. The two men argue for a bit before Candy and Melissa lead Crow out of the club. The trio catches a cab to Melissa's house, a five story townhouse. The three sleep for a few hours before Melissa wakes Crow up and asks him to paint more paintings for the showing that Geoff arranged for him. Although Crow momentarily worries that he will be found out, he goes <b>downstair</b> in Melissa's studio and, drawing on the information that Danny has imparted to him previously, paints three pictures.|$|E
5000|$|Porcupine Tree's frontman, Steven Wilson, {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the EP's title and commented about its relationship with the concept of Fear of a Blank Planet: “I just thought it was an interesting idea I had. I had this instrumental, and I didn’t have a title, so I called it [...] "Nil Recurring". It’s always quite hard to name instrumentals, because obviously there’s no subject matter to relate it to. I just thought the idea was quite funny. I kind of like absurd titles. I kind of have a history of having these titles that make no sense, like Up the <b>Downstair.</b> I mean, Nil Recurring is another paradox-like statement. You cannot have the number nil recurring. So it’s just a bit of fun really. And of course, it seemed to fit in with the lyrical concept of some of the other pieces that featured on Fear of a Blank Planet. It was that idea of blankness, of not being there, or negativity that helped gave that piece - and the EP - its title.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Up the <b>Downstair</b> is {{the second}} studio album by British {{progressive}} rock band Porcupine Tree, first released in May 1993. It was originally {{intended to be a}} double album set including the song [...] "Voyage 34", which was instead released as a single in 1992, and other material that ended up on the Staircase Infinities EP (1994). In 2005, it was partially re-recorded, fully re-mixed, remastered and re-released along with the Staircase Infinities EP as a double album. The re-release contains a new mix by Steven Wilson, along with recorded drums by Gavin Harrison that replace the electronic drums of the original version. Steven Wilson has stated that the title of the album came from a line in the song [...] "Voyage 34." [...] There is still a title track, however. Another re-release on double vinyl was pressed on 14 August 2008 on Kscope records. This is identical to the 2005 release, except it is printed on coloured vinyl and the Staircase Infinities disc contains the song [...] "Phantoms".|$|E
