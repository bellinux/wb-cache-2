5000|$|A {{commonly}} held misconception concerning {{the rules of}} marine navigation is that by following specific rules, a vessel can gain certain rights of <b>way</b> over other <b>vessels.</b> No vessel ever has absolute [...] "right of way" [...] over other vessels. Rather, {{there can be a}} [...] "give way" [...] (burdened) vessel and a [...] "stand on" [...] (privileged) vessel, or there may be two <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>vessels</b> with no stand on vessel. A stand on vessel does not have an absolute right of <b>way</b> over any <b>give</b> <b>way</b> <b>vessel,</b> for if there is a risk of collision, a stand on vessel may still be obliged under Rule 2 and Rule 17 to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> so as to avoid it, if doing so will be effective and is practicable.{} {} Two power-driven vessels approaching each other head to head, are both deemed to be [...] "give way" [...] and both are required to alter course so as to avoid colliding with the other. Neither vessel has [...] "right of way".{} ...|$|R

50|$|The canal's {{navigation}} {{channel is}} only {{wide enough to}} pass a single ship at a time, and vessels proceeding up the lake must <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to <b>vessels</b> proceeding downstream.

5000|$|Unsure port <b>gives</b> <b>way.</b> If a <b>vessel,</b> {{with the}} wind on the port side, sees a vessel to {{windward}} and cannot determine whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or the starboard side, they must <b>give</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "rules of the road" [...] for {{ships and}} boats declare that when the courses of two sailing vessels converge, the vessel on port tack must <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to a <b>vessel</b> on {{starboard}} tack.|$|R
2500|$|Frosta's pilot, Nicholas Colombo, {{correctly}} {{assessed the}} risk of collision and sought agreement on a safe passage for both vessels. Local custom was for small <b>vessels</b> to <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to large <b>vessels</b> in stream traffic, due to the relative difficulty in maneuvering ships in the channel, but could not absolve him of the legal requirement to yield to traffic approaching from his starboard. According to the investigators, [...] "This casualty {{is a classic example}} of the tragic consequences which can result from conflict between established custom and the law when each mandates a different response by the persons involved." ...|$|R
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must <b>give</b> <b>way</b> to commercial <b>vessels.</b> 600 tonne vessels, designed to make maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|R
60|$|Erling knew, however, {{that these}} were sure {{to be picked up}} by the King's ships, so he once more ordered the rowers to <b>give</b> <b>way,</b> and the <b>vessel</b> sprang forth on her voyage some time before the pursuers reached the boom. When these did so, most of them {{attempted}} to leap it as the fugitives had done--for none of the Norsemen there lacked spirit. Some, however, failed to get on to it at all, others got on a short way and stuck fast, while two or three ships broke their backs, as Glumm's had done, and threw their crews into the water--but not one got over.|$|R
25|$|The {{poor quality}} of the crew {{came to the fore}} on 21 June when Hippomene was {{cruising}} off Antigua. Taking advantage of Hippomenes Dutch design, Mackenzie had disguised her as a Guinea trader. A Guadeloupe privateer, the Buonaparte, of 18 long 8-pounders and a crew of 146 men, sighted Hippomenes and sailed to take her. The two vessels exchanged fire until Buonaparte ran into Hippomenes. Mackenzie had his crew lash the privateer's bowsprit to the mainmast and jumped on board the privateer, followed by his officers and a few men, some 18 in all. Unfortunately, {{the rest of the crew}} remained behind. In the fight on the privateer, the British lost five dead and eight wounded; only nine of the original 18 managed to escape back to Hippomenes (two officers and two men remained on board Buonaparte as prisoners). The boarding party barely got back in time before the lashings <b>gave</b> <b>way</b> and the <b>vessels</b> parted, at which time the privateer sailed away. On Hippomenes his wounds rendered Mackenzie himself senseless for a while. In the engagement prior to the boarding, the Buonaparte had lost five dead and 15 wounded.|$|R

Mackenzie had his crew lash the privateer's bowsprit to the mainmast and jumped on board the privateer, followed by his officers and a few men, some 18 in all.

50|$|Playboaters still {{generally}} follow {{right of}} way conventions that are commercially established. The vessel upstream of a feature has right of <b>way</b> over a <b>vessel</b> in the feature.
