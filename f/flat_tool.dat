40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} have replaced traditional plowing and conventional seedbed tillage in some dry areas in Western Canada and the USA. The planter or seed drill {{is an important}} piece of equipment used in crop production systems. Because of time constraints and large cropped areas, high-speed seeding operations are desirable. However, the increased draft and power requirements associated with high operating speeds are major factors limiting the speeds at which it is feasible to use tillage tools. Dynamic effects on soil-tool cutting forces are important when operating at elevated speeds. The rate-dependent behaviour of narrow tillage tools was investigated in this study. A 9 -m long linear monorail system was developed to carry narrow tools through a linear soil bin at high speeds. Steady-state speeds from 0. 5 to 10. 0 m/s over 1 to 3 m were attained using this system. The performance of tools with rectangular, triangular and elliptical cross sections were studied.

40|$|Abstract. Processing through {{volumetric}} cold {{plastic deformation}} (cold rolling) with <b>flat</b> wedge <b>tools</b> is a procedure used in mass production to process profiles (circular, threads, grooves, teeth) on revolution pieces. Complex profiles obtained by cold plastic deformation with <b>flat</b> wedge <b>tools</b> have important advantages: material economy, high productivity, continuous fibre, superior mechanic properties, low {{values of the}} roughness parameters, low costs. In recent years, the simulation of processes of volumetric plastic deformation by the finite element method is used to obtain the optimization of the deformation process and {{the improvement of the}} product quality even from the design stage. By numerical simulation there is observed the evolution during the process of different parameters such as: stress and deformations in the deformed body, mode of material flow, final shape and sizes of the product etc. Therefore, it becomes possible to analyse the process even from the design stage by identifying the problems which can appear and their influence on some characteristics of the product obtained: geometry, state of deformations and stress. This paper presents the experimental determination of the deformation force at the processing of complex profiles with <b>flat</b> wedge <b>tools</b> and the influence of the friction coefficient between tool and semi-product on its value; influence established by simulating the deformation process. The process also has been simulated by means of finite element calculations using the Abaqus/Explicit code. The material behaviour is described by using a 5 -parameter strain-hardening law and by accounting for thermal effects at high strain-rates. The comparison between the values and the variation of the deformation force recorded experimentally and at simulation allows establishing the optimal value of the friction coefficient and validating the numerical model developed...|$|R

A detailed analysis of experimental cutting forces and the identification of empirical cutting force equations similar to that usually used for <b>flat</b> <b>tools</b> are proposed. The main focus of this work is on the study of chip flow angle deduced here from experimental cutting forces, considering that the chip flow direction is collinear to the friction force.

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of the compaction process specially with using high-speed tablet presses necessitates the use of robust monitoring tools during the process. The use of an instrumented compaction simulator in the early stage of development has a significant benefit for product development and scaling-up. Up to now, in tableting research rare {{attention has been paid}} to the measurement of die-wall pressure. Die-wall instrumentation would be essential to understand the deformation of particles under axial pressure during the compaction cycle. It would be also of great help to investigate particle–die-wall shear stresses or friction, which is the cause of many tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking. Purpose: To investigate the effect of compaction process variables ((pre) compression pressure, speed, ejection angle, tooling shape), formulation variables (filler, lubricant, binder, drug loading), powder physico-chemical properties (particle size and shape, water activity) on the compaction process through radial die-wall monitoring. Common tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking were also investigated. Materials and Methods: Using a fully instrumented compaction simulator, the Presster™ guided by mathematical modeling and experimental design. Materials with different compaction behaviors: viscoelastic, plastic, brittle, plastic/brittle. Results and Discussion: Regarding tablet press parameters, by increasing compaction pressure radial die-wall pressure was increased for all materials (RDP and MDP), while with increasing pre-compaction residual die-wall pressure (RDP) was decreased for plastic materials, whereas by increasing speed maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) was decreased for all materials. Plastic and brittle materials showed increased tendencies for friction because of high radial relaxation. An increasing RDP value during compaction would indicate higher tendency for friction, whereas a high constant value of MDP would provide an evidence for plastic behavior. High compaction force combined with high speed should be avoided to prevent capping. Increasing ejection angle increased friction tendencies and ejection force for powders. Effective Fall Time (EFT) derived from decompression time was a reliable tool for sticking prediction. Moreover, radial die-wall monitoring was a more sensitive tool to detect sticking in comparison to take-off force. <b>Flat</b> shape <b>tooling</b> increased radial die-wall pressure while it was reduced by concave tooling due to more homogeneity in density distribution as well as greater area of contact. However, concave tooling showed higher friction and capping in comparison to <b>flat</b> <b>tooling</b> due to more radial movement for the powder, which resulted in higher densification at the edges in comparison to <b>flat</b> <b>tooling.</b> Concerning formulation variables, additives enhancing the elasticity or weakening the bonds such as lubricants or increasing drug loading promoted the occurrence of capping, while additives improving the mechanical strength such as binders reduced capping. The RDP/MDP ratio was not suitable as a sensitive parameter for the evaluation of lubricants, since it was only changed for plastic and/or brittle materials. Also, MDP was a good predictor for axial pressure transmission to the die-wall. External lubrication reduced the die-wall-compact friction without affecting the deformation behavior of the formulation. High RDP values were not always responsible for capping, because MCC exhibited low RDP values and still showed capping, therefore, other parameters such ER 0 and tensile strength should also be considered. Regarding physico-chemical properties of powders, small / irregular particles acted more plastically at high compression, showed better axial pressure transmission, more porous and stronger compacts, and had higher tendency for friction and sticking than bigger particles. On the other hand, high water activity resulted in a low RDP and friction for all materials, and a high MDP for plastic materials. This was due to the lubricating and plasticizing effects of water, respectively. Conclusion: Radial die-wall pressure monitoring is recommended as a valuable tool to assess the deformation behavior of materials and detect friction and adhesion at early stages of development and during production as well, which would be of great help to predict common scaling-up tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking...|$|R
