25|$|Cowell's {{interest}} in harmonic rhythm, {{as discussed in}} New Musical Resources, led him in 1930 to commission Léon Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch. The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> patterns simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.|$|E

Therefore, the ensemble grew from the traditional Tiple and Güiro, to a one that included: guitar, [...] "bandurria", Cuban lute, claves, and other instruments such as the"tumbandera", the [...] "marímbula", the [...] "botija", the bongoes, the common [...] "machete" [...] (cutlass) and the accordion.|$|E
2500|$|Mbenga–Mbuti Pygmy music {{consists}} {{of up to}} four parts and {{can be described as}} an [...] "ostinato with variations" [...] similar to a passacaglia in that it is cyclical. It is based on repetition of periods of equal length that each singer divides using <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This creates a detailed surface and endless variations not only of the same period repeated but of various performances of the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan music these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or think of their music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up.|$|E

2500|$|The Solesmes monks also determined, {{based on}} their research, {{performance}} practice for Gregorian chant. Because of the ambiguity of medieval musical notation, the question of rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested by scholars. Some neumes, such as the pressus, do indicate the lengthening of notes. Common modern practice, following the Solesmes interpretation, is to perform Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, in which time is free, allowing the text to determine the accent and the melodic contour to determine phrasing. By the 13th century, with {{the widespread use of}} square notation, it is believed that most chant was sung with each note getting approximately an equal value, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened. [...] The Solesmes school, represented by Dom Pothier and Dom Mocquereau, supports a rhythm of equal values per note, allowing for lengthening and shortening of note values for musical purposes. A second school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, supports <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> realizations of chant by imposing musical meter on the chant in various ways. [...] Musicologist Gustave Reese said that the second group, called mensuralists, [...] "have an impressive amount of historical evidence on their side" [...] (Music in the Middle Ages, p.146), but the equal-note Solesmes interpretation has permeated the musical world, apparently due to its ease of learning and resonance with modern musical taste.|$|E
2500|$|As the yet unnamed genre evolved, {{the use of}} sampled funk breakbeats became {{increasingly}} complex. Most notable and widely spread is the Amen break taken from a b-side funk track [...] "Amen, Brother" [...] by the Winston Brothers (The Winstons). During this time producers began cutting apart loops and using the component drum sounds to create new rhythms. [...] To match the complex drum lines, basslines which had less {{in common with the}} patterns of house and techno music than with the phrasings of dub and hip hop began to be used. As the beat-per-minute range rose above 165, the emerging drum and bass sound became incompatible for straightforward DJ mixing with house and techno, which typically range dozens of beats-per-minute less (making it impossible to play the tracks at the same speed on club equipment). This sonic identity became highly distinctive for both the depth of its bass and the increasingly complex, rapid-fire breakbeat percussion. [...] Vastly <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> patterns were distinctively being used, as well as new types of sampling, synthesis and effects processing techniques, resulting in a greater focus on the intricacies of sampling/synthesis production and rhythm. This notably included early use of the time stretching effect which was often used on percussion or vocal samples. As the influences of reggae and dub became more prominent, the sound of drum and bass began to take on an urban sound which was heavily influenced by ragga and dancehall music as well as hip hop, often incorporating the distinctive vocal styles of these musical genres. [...] This reggae/dancehall influenced sound is most commonly associated with the term jungle.|$|E

The questionnaire assessed athletes’ perception about their parental involvement (directive behavior, praise and understanding, active involvement, pressure) and their desired parental involvement. The results showed that athletes in rhythmic, artistic gymnastics and swimming scored higher in praise and understanding, rhythmic and artistic gymnastics athletes perceived higher active involvement than desired and rhythmic gymnastics athletes perceived higher directive behavior than desired. Athletes in specializing phase desired more parental praise and understanding. Finally, pressure was predicted from all parental involvement variables. As parental involvement differs between sports, the results are discussed in order to minimize the negative influence of parental involvement in each sport...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The later-period {{structure}} of Fuyang oil layer is very complex, and the reservoir mainly consists of river-way sand. The {{form of the}} reservoir is narrow and distributed differently, so {{it is very hard}} to identify. To accurately predict sand bodies, the sand bodies in the river way are comparatively studied using multiple post-stack seismic attributes, and finally a conclusion is made as follows: the reservoir interpretation technology based on frequency possesses a high spatial resolution and can test the spectrum lateral variation caused by different deposits, and then the plane distributions of the river-way and other deposits are described using equifrequent slices, and the combination characteristics of <b>different</b> deposit <b>rhythmic</b> layers are quantitatively analyzed, and also the thickness change of the river-way can be quantitatively analyzed under the ideal condition. Meanwhile, spectrum imaging is implemented using the tuning frequency of the different thickness of the sand bodies, and the reservoir is identified through the spatial changes of amplitude energy, facies values, and frequency attenuation attributes under the different chosen frequency, so that the spatial discontinuity of the deposits is effectively described. Therefore, it can meet the exploration and development needs of the oil field to a certain extent. The actual demand to identify the sand bodies in riverwa...|$|R

Therefore, it was surprising when studies of circadian rhythmic behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila suggested that the normal operations of circadian clock cells, which house the molecular oscillator, in fact depend on non-cell-autonomous effects — interactions between the clock cells themselves. Here we review several genetic analyses that broadly extend that viewpoint. They support a model whereby the approximately 150 circadian clock cells in the brain of the fly are sub-divided into functionally discrete rhythmic centers. These centers alternatively cooperate or compete to control the <b>different</b> episodes of <b>rhythmic</b> behavior that define the fly's daily activity profile...|$|R
