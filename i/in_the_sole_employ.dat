Two approaches were undertaken to establish the characteristics of <b>the</b> receptors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole.</b> Psychophysical vibrotactile thresholds (range 25 - 400 Hz) were determined across <b>the</b> unloaded <b>sole</b> <b>in</b> young and elderly subjects. Thresholds were lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ball and arch of <b>the</b> <b>sole,</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heel and toe regions. Elderly subjects demonstrated significantly elevated thresholds for high-frequency vibration. Secondly, microneurographic recordings were made from skin afferents of <b>the</b> unloaded <b>sole</b> <b>in</b> young subjects. Results indicated that while similar types of cutaneous receptors exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sole</b> of <b>the</b> foot and hand, there appear to be differences in receptor density and distribution. Our results demonstrate that cutaneous afferent inputs from <b>the</b> foot <b>sole</b> provide useful information for the control of posture and locomotio...|$|R
