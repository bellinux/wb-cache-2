Para isso, a área experimental, com 1000 plantas do clone RRIM 600, foi dividida em 100 parcelas de dez plantas cada uma. As amostragens foram {{realizadas}} de dezembro de 2007 a junho de 2008 em intervalos de aproximadamente dez dias. Em cada data foram amostradas duas plantas por parcela, coletando-se de cada uma, uma extremidade de ramo com aproximadamente 30 cm de comprimento. No laboratório, os ácaros foram avaliados com o uso de lupa de bolso de 20 X de aumento, em seis folíolos por parcela, sendo três de cada ramo. A contagem de C. heveae foi realizada em duas áreas de 1 cm 2 na página superior dos folíolos. Para T. heveae a contagem foi realizada em duas áreas de 1 cm 2 na página inferior dos folíolos, sendo uma sobre a nervura principal e outra sobre a nervura lateral. Para medir a distribuição espacial foram calculados os índices de dispersão: razão variância média (I), índice de Morisita (d I), coeficiente de Green (Cx) e expoente k da distribuição Binomial Negativa. O plano de amostragem seqüencial foi desenvolvido de acordo com o Teste Seqüencial da Razão de Verossimilhança (TSRV). Foi pré-estabelecido o valor de 0, 10 para e que representam o Erro Tipo I e Erro Tipo II, respectivamente. O nível de controle adotado foi de 17 % de infestação para C. heveae e 39 % de infestação para T. heveae. Foi determinada a Curva Característica de Operação [CO(p) ] e a Curva do Tamanho Máximo Esperado de Amostra [Ep(n) ].

The {{objective of}} this work was to study the spatial distribution and developing a sequential sampling plan for the mites Calacarus heveae Feres and Tenuipalpus heveae Baker on rubber tree crop. For this reason, the experimental area, with 1000 plants of RRIM 600 clone, was divided into 100 plots of ten plants each. Samples were taken from December 2007 to June of 2008 at intervals of about ten days. On each date were sampled two plants per plot, capturing of each, one end of class with about 30 cm in length. In the laboratory, the mites were evaluated using a magnifying <b>glass,</b> <b>pocket</b> of 20 X to increase in six leaves per plot, three of each branch. The counting of C. heveae was conducted in two areas of 1 cm 2 in the upper leaflets. For T. heveae the counting was done in two areas of 1 cm 2 in the lower leaflets, one on the main vein and one vein on the side. To measure the spatial distribution were calculated rates of dispersal: variance/mean relationship (I), index of Morisita (I), coefficient of Green (Cx) and k exponent of negative binomial distribution. The sequential sampling plan was developed {{in accordance with the}} Sequential Test of the Likelihood Ratio (TSRV). First was pre-established value of 0. 10 for and representing the Error Type I and Type II error, respectively. The level of control adopted was 17 % of infestation for C. heveae and 39 % of infestation for T. heveae. It was determined the Operation Characteristic Curves [CO(p) ] and Curve of the High Expected Sample Size [Ep(n) ]. These results and as the indices of distribution used was found that C. heveae and T. heveae present distribution of rubber tree crop in the aggregate, is adjusting to the Negative Binomial distribution model. For the sequential sampling plan of C. heveae were obtained two lines: an upper (S 1 = 17, 0106 + 2, 0949 N), from which control is recommended, and another lower (S 0 = - 17, 0106 + 2, 0949 N), until [...] .

40|$|Silicon carbide based {{materials}} are being increasingly {{used as a}} room temperature structural material. Unfortunately, there have been very few studies of the mechanical behaviour of SiC at room temperature especially studies incorporating slow crack growth. In order to address this gap, this thesis will focus on room temperatures only. SiC {{materials are}} produced {{with a wide range}} of grain boundary chemistries and grain morphologies with the aid of sintering additives. Therefore, in this thesis two different chemistries were produced using solid state (SS-SiC) sintering with carbon and boron or liquid phase sintering (LP-SiC) using alumina and yttria, materials with fine and coarse grains were produced for each chemistry. The fracture toughness at room temperature is improved by a factor of two using LP- sintering and by introducing elongated grains. The toughening mechanisms responsible for this improvement are discussed. The magnitude of the short range closing forces becomes larger as grain size increases irrespective of chemistry. This was expected for materials with intergranular failure, but not for materials that exhibit transgranular failure. FIB technique was used to investigate the toughening mechanisms of short range cracks and new findings are proposed. Slow crack growth (SCG) investigations in air and in water at room temperature show that the presence of <b>glass</b> <b>pockets</b> and oxide complexions makes LP-SiC materials prone to stress corrosion, while materials such as SS-SiC with no glass or oxides in their microstructure are immune to SCG. Possible suggestions are discussed to quantify the effect of grain size on SCG. For all the studied materials no apparent cyclic fatigue in air was observed. This was expected for brittle materials such as SS-SiC, but not for LP-SiC. In order to clarify the significance of the measured mechanical properties, a lifetime analysis in the presence of artificial and natural defects is presented. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{discovery}} of a new shergottite from Tunisia, Ksar Ghilane (KG) 002. This single stone, weighing 538 g, is a coarse-grained basaltic shergottite, mainly composed of maskelynitized plagioclase (approximately 52 vol%) and pyroxene (approximately 37 vol%). It also contains Fe-rich olivine (approximately 4. 5 vol%), large Ca-phosphates, including both merrillites and Cl-apatites (approximately 3. 4 vol%), minor amounts of silica or SiO_ 2 -normative K-rich glass, pyrrhotite, Ti-magnetite, ilmenite, and accessory baddeleyite. The largest crystals of pyroxene and plagioclase reach sizes of approximately 4 to 5 mm. Pyroxenes (Fs_(26 – 96) En_(5 – 50) Wo_(2 – 41)). They typically range from cores of about Fs_(29) En_(41) Wo_(30) to rims of about Fs_(68) En_(14) Wo_(17). Maskelynite is Ab_(41 – 49) An_(39 – 58) Or_(1 – 7) in composition, but some can be as anorthitic as An_(93). Olivine (Fa_(91 – 96)) occurs mainly within symplectitic intergrowths, in paragenesis with ilmenite, or at neighboring areas of symplectites. KG 002 is heavily shocked (S 5) as indicated by mosaic extinction of pyroxenes, maskelynitized plagioclase, the occurrence of localized shock melt <b>glass</b> <b>pockets,</b> and low radiogenic He concentration. Oxygen isotopes confirm that it is a normal member of the SNC suite. KG 002 is slightly depleted in LREE and shows a positive Eu anomaly, providing evidence for complex magma genesis and mantle processes on Mars. Noble gases with a composition thought to be characteristic for Martian interior is a dominant component. Measurements of ^(10) Be, ^(26) Al, and ^(53) Mn and comparison with Monte Carlo calculations of production rates indicate that KG 002 has been exposed to cosmic rays most likely as a single meteoroid body of 35 – 65 cm radius. KG 002 strongly resembles Los Angeles and NWA 2800 basaltic shergottites in element composition, petrography, and mineral chemistry, suggesting a possible launch-pairing.

40|$|Basaltic shergottites such as Shergotty, Zagami and EET 79001 contain impact melt <b>glass</b> <b>pockets</b> {{that are}} rich in Martian {{atmospheric}} gases [1] and are known as gas-rich impact-melt (GRIM) glasses. These glasses show evidence {{for the presence of}} a Martian regolith component based on Sm and Kr isotopic studies [2]. The GRIM glasses are sometimes embedded with clusters of innumerable micron-sized iron-sulfide blebs associated with minor amounts of iron sulfate particles [3, 4]. These sulfide blebs are secondary in origin and are not related to the primary igneous sulfides occurring in Martian meteorites. The material comprising these glasses arises from the highly oxidizing Martian surface and sulfur is unlikely to occur as sulfide in the Martian regoilith. Instead, sulfur is shown to occur as sulfate based on APXS and Mossbauer results obtained by the Opportunity and Spirit rovers at Meridiani and Gusev [5]. We have earlier suggested that the micron-sized iron sulfide globules in GRIM glasses were likely produced by shock-reduction of iron sulfate occurring in the regolith at the time when the GRIM glasses were produced by the meteoroid impact that launched the Martian meteorites into space [6]. As a result of high energy deposition by shock (approx. 40 - 60 GPa), the iron sulfate bearing phases are likely to melt along with other regolith components and will get reduced to immiscible sulfide fluid under reducing conditions. On quenching, this generates a dispersion of micron-scale sulfide blebs. The reducing agents in our case are likely to be H 2 and CO which were shock-implanted from the Martian atmosphere into these glasses along with the noble gases. We conducted lab simulation experiments in the Lindhurst Laboratory of Experimental Geophysics at Caltech and the Experimental Impact Laboratory at JSC to test whether iron sulfide globules can be produced by impact-driven reduction of iron sulfate by subjecting Columbia River Basalt (CRB) and ferric sulfate mixtures to shock pressures between 40 and 50 GPa under reducing conditions.

Normal oscillatory zoning is often characterized by {{a sharp increase in}} FeO (Δ ~ 2 wt%) accompanied by a drop in Al 2 O 3 on the outermost 30 μm. Reverse oscillatory zoning, by contrast, exhibits a drop in FeO, Al 2 O 3 (Δ ~ 2 wt%), and a remarkable crystal rim increase in MgO (up to 5 wt%).

Cpx with reverse zoning and dusty rims has low Sr, La, Zr, and REE contents toward crystal rims. Thermometers and barometers, based on equilibrium cpx-melt pairs, suggest that cpx cores start nucleating at 720 MPa, with the majority of them forming between 600 and 400 MPa but continuing to crystallize until very shallow depths (< 100 MPa).

Glasses vary widely in composition depending on the textural domains and attain Si- and alkali-rich compositions (SiO 2 = 47. 0 - 68. 3 wt. %; Na 2 O+K 2 O= 5. 8 - 12. 2 wt. %). Incompatible trace element patterns of glasses in anhydrous xenoliths are closely {{similar to those of the}} host alkali basalts, whereas the compositions of interstitial and vein glasses in the hydrous xenoliths indicate that a compositional control has been exerted by the local mineral assemblage (plainly amphibole). The delta O- 18 values of carbonate from the <b>glass</b> <b>pockets</b> and veins in the xenoliths, as well as of carbonate globules and amygdales in the host basalts are in the range 19. 62 to 21. 04 parts per thousand. Corresponding delta C- 13 values are - 9. 25 to - 10. 12 parts per thousand and - 7. 59 to - 9. 32 parts per thousand, respectively. These values are very different from those of primary carbonatites and the delta O- 18 values clearly exceed those expected for minerals and glasses from mantle assemblages. The similarity of isotopic ratios of carbonates from both xenoliths and host lavas and their shift towards low delta C- 13 and high delta O- 18 values may be the result of basalt-peridotite interaction during ascent of the mantle xenoliths. Our study points to a close relationship between the infiltration of carbonic fluid together with fractions of the host alkali basalt, and melting of hydrous peridotite-forming minerals. Assuming an initial average content of 1. 5 - 2 wt. % CO 2 in the primary alkaline melt and considering that the dissolved amounts of CO 2 and H 2 O in such a melt at 400 MPa can be in the order of 0. 3 wt. % and 3. 5 % respectively, approximately 75 to 50 % of the total carbon dioxide load was released by the uprising host magma. This process led to infiltration and entrapment of high-density CO 2 inclusions in the GG mantle rocks, to hydrous phase breakdown and to carbonate precipitation in veins and at some reaction sites after the primary mantle minerals. We propose that formation of CO 2 inclusions, glass and carbonate in hydrated mantle xenoliths is not unique of carbonatite metasomatism: comparable effects can be produced by degassing alkaline magmas.

40|$|The angrites are a {{small and}} {{heterogeneous}} group of achondritic meteorites with highly unusual chemical and mineralogical features. The abundant presence of glasses in D'Orbigny makes this rock a unique member of the angrite group. Glasses fill open spaces, form pockets, and occur as inclusions in olivines. Their physical settings exclude an incorporation from an external source. Major and trace element (rare earth elements [REE], Li, B, Be, transition elements, N and C) contents of these glasses and host olivines were measured combining laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA), and EMP techniques. Based on the major element composition, glasses filling voids could represent either a melt formed by melting an angritic rock or a melt from which angrites could have crystallized. Trace element contents of these glasses strongly indicate a direct link to the D'Orbigny bulk meteorite. They are incompatible {{with the formation of}} the glasses by partial melting of a chondritic source rock or by shock melting. The refractory elements (e. g., Al, Ti, Ca) have about 10 × CI abundances with CaO/TiO 2 and FeO/MnO ratios being approximately chondritic. Trace element abundances in the glasses appear to be governed by volatility and suggest that the refractory elements in the source had chondritic relative abundances. Although the glasses (and the whole rock) lack volatile elements such as Na and K, they are rich in some moderately volatile elements such as B, V, Mn, Fe (all with close to CI abundances), and Li (about 3 – 5 × CI). These elements likely were added to the glass in a sub-solidus metasomatic elemental exchange event. We have identified a novel mechanism for alteration of glass and rock compositions based on an exchange of Al and Sc for Fe and other moderately volatile elements in addition to the well-known metasomatic exchange reactions (e. g., Ca-Na and Mg-Fe). Because glass inclusions in olivine were partly shielded from the metasomatic events by the host crystal, their chemical composition is believed to be closer to the original composition than that of any other glasses. The relative trace element abundances in glasses of glass inclusions in olivine and <b>glass</b> <b>pockets</b> are also unfractionated and at the 10 to 20 × CI level. These glasses are chemically similar to the common void-filling glasses but show a much wider compositional variation. Inclusion glasses demonstrate that at least olivine grew {{with the help of a}} liquid. In analogy to olivines in carbonaceous chondrites, initial formation could also have been a vapor-liquid-solid condensation process. At that time, the glass had a purely refractory composition. This composition, however, was severely altered by the metasomatic addition of large amounts of FeO and other moderately volatile elements. The presence of volatile elements such as carbon and nitrogen in glasses of glass inclusions is another feature that appears to give these glasses a link with those hosted by olivines of carbonaceous chondrites. All these features point to an origin from a vapor with relative abundances of condensable elements similar to those in the solar nebula...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} the Guin ungrouped iron meteorite inclusions have been investigated experimentally. The structural characteristics of polished and etched slabs of the meteorite were studied microscopically in reflected light. Modal abundances of troilite nodules and silicate inclusions were determined by weighing paper traces. The bulk composition of the silicate inclusions was calculated by combining modal phase abundances and mineral compositions. It is found that the largest silicate inclusion (2 x 4 cm) consists mostly of a shock-melted plagioclase-rich matrix surrounding large, partly melted augite grains. The oxygen isotopic composition of the inclusion is near that of LL chondrites. The inclusion is found to be similar in composition to selected melt <b>pocket</b> <b>glasses</b> in ordinary chondrites produced in situ by preferential melting of plagioclase rock due to shock compression. It is suggested that the Guin assemblage was formed by impact melting on a chondritic parent body. Silicate inclusions in IIE irons share many of the compositional and petrological characteristics of the Guin inclusions, indicating that IIE irons also formed by impact-melting of chondritic materials. Black and white photomicrographs of the silicate inclusions are provided...|$|R
