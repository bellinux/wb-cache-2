Harvey had been an Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) member for more than 50 years, and would {{occasionally}} talk about flying to his radio audience. He {{was a member of}} the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA), and was frequently seen at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in the Duluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturing company, Cirrus Aircraft. According to AOPA Pilot contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term skyjack, and is credited with popularizing the terms Reaganomics and <b>guesstimate.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{inferred}} from the probable number of languages and the <b>guesstimate</b> of pre-contact population levels {{that there may}} have been from 3,000 - 4,800 speakers on average for each of the 250 languages. A number of these languages were almost immediately wiped out within decades of colonization, the case of the Aboriginal Tasmanians being one notorious example of precipitous linguistic ethnocide. Tasmania had been separated from the mainland at the end of the Quaternary glaciation, and indigenous Tasmanians remained isolated from the outside world for around 12,000 years. Claire Bowern has concluded in a recent study that there were twelve Tasmanian languages, and that those languages are unrelated (that is, not demonstrably related) to those on the Australian mainland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Guesstimate</b> is an {{informal}} English portmanteau of [...] and estimate, first used by American statisticians in 1934 or 1935. It {{is defined as}} an estimate made without using adequate or complete information, or, more strongly, as an estimate arrived at by guesswork or conjecture. Like the words estimate and guess, <b>guesstimate</b> {{may be used as}} a verb or a noun (with the same change in pronunciation as estimate). A <b>guesstimate</b> may be a first rough approximation pending a more accurate estimate, or it may be an educated guess at something for which no better information will become available.|$|E

50|$|Guess values can be {{determined}} a number of ways. Guessing is one of them. If one {{is familiar with the}} type of problem, then this is an educated guess or <b>guesstimate.</b> Other techniques include linearization, solving simultaneous equations, reducing dimensions, treating the problem as a time series, converting the problem to a (hopefully) linear differential equation, and using mean values. Further methods for determining starting values and optimal values in their own right come from stochastic methods, the most commonly known of these being evolutionary algorithms and particularly genetic algorithms.|$|E
50|$|The 1991 Census {{recorded}} 9,301 Brazilian born {{people in}} the UK, and the 2001 Census recorded 15,215. In 2004, the Brazilian Consulate in London had 13,000 Brazilians registered as living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics estimates suggest that there were 56,000 Brazilian-born people resident in the UK in 2008. Several <b>guesstimates</b> of the current Brazilian British population, including those of Brazilian descent, put the number of Brazilian British people at around 200,000.|$|R
40|$|Analyzing US {{economic}} and foreign aid data from 1967 to 2007, this paper investigates whether adverse {{economic and}} financial conditions are negatively linked to official development assistance (ODA). It finds empirical evidence that US ODA has tended to decline as its economic conditions worsen. A 1 unit increase in the misery index (sum of inflation and unemployment) {{is associated with a}} roughly 0. 01 percentage point decline in US ODA expressed as a share of GNI. Furthermore, an increase in financial volatility from 1 percent to 2 percent (measured by the standard deviation of the rate of return of the S&P 500) is associated with a decrease in US ODA by about $ 2. 78 billion. Informed by the empirical results in this paper, and based on very rough <b>guesstimates,</b> a potential decline in US ODA of anywhere from 13 to 30 percent could occur depending on the severity of the economic conditions in 2009. This predicted decline in ODA is much lower than some of the <b>guesstimates</b> so far by different analysts. Based on the US historical pattern, ODA is indeed at risk; nevertheless, it need not decline significantly during adverse economic times. ODA, foreign aid, financial crisis, misery index...|$|R
30|$|As {{with all}} {{statistics}} on intra-European migration {{in the era}} of free movement, {{estimates of the number of}} Italians living in the UK are no better than informed guesses. The 2011 Census recorded 130, 000 Italian-born, but many of these are long-resident and now elderly labour migrants who arrived in the 1950 s and 1960 s. <b>Guesstimates</b> put the real scale of the Italian presence as at least 200, 000 – the opposite situation to the German case where the Germany-born total exceeds the ‘real’ German presence by roughly similar numbers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{heuristic}} technique ( [...] ; εὑρίσκω, [...] "find" [...] or [...] "discover"), {{often called}} simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not {{guaranteed to be}} optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods {{can be used to}} speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, <b>guesstimate,</b> stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.|$|E

40|$|Because {{information}} on the livelihoods of indigenous groups is often missing from colonial records, their presence usually escapes attention in quantitative estimates of colonial growth, inequality and productivity.

5000|$|For University of Sydney {{historian}} Vicki Grieves, Windschuttle's approach {{reads as}} though indigenous people [...] "were not the intentional {{targets of the}} colonisers but accidental targets, mostly through their inability to be realistic, objective, logical and moral, and thus the [...] "seeds of their own destruction" [...] lay within their own [...] "psyche and culture". Even were one to concede Windschuttle's <b>guesstimate</b> for the pre-white population of Tasmania, by his own figures, the death-rate for his plausible deaths still works out as higher in percentage terms than the mortality risk of the Australian population during WW1, when 60,000 soldiers died. Windschuttle shows, she argues, a predilection for old colonial explanations, and Darwinist values, as though nothing had happened in between. Regarding native treatment of women, who in his account were viciously brutalized, Windschuttle appeals to the reader's moral outrage at the way a 14-year-old native girl was traded. In doing so, he {{ignores the fact that}} the age of consent in Britain at that time was 12, and whites themselves on the frontier exchanged wives or traded them for tobacco and rum.|$|E
5000|$|In a Cramer-Bopp plot for Lewis bases, the {{parameter}} Ra {{reflects the}} mode of bonding of a potential Lewis acid partner, from purely electrostatic interactions (Ra = &minus;1) to purely covalent interactions (Ra = +1). The parameter [...] reflects {{the strength of the}} bonding interaction. The plot shown here allows comparison of three chosen Lewis bases: acetonitrile, ammonia, and dimethyl sulfide. The Lewis acid iodine (Ra = 0.6) will interact most strongly with dimethyl sulfide and least strongly with acetonitrile, whereas triethylgallium (Ra = &minus;0.65) will interact most strongly with ammonia and least strongly with dimethyl sulfide. The plot also shows that ammonia is a stronger Lewis base than acetonitrile irrespective of its Lewis acid partner, whereas the relative strengths of ammonia and dimethyl sulfide as Lewis bases depends on the bonding characteristics of the Lewis acid, swapping order when Ra = &minus;0.4. (NB: <b>Guesstimate).</b> The Cramer-Bopp plot was developed as a visual tool for comparing Lewis base strength with the range of possible Lewis acid partners, and a similar plot can be constructed to examine selected Lewis acids against the range of possible Lewis bases. References 3,6,10 & 11 contain graphical presentations that define the ranking order of strength of many Lewis acids and bases.|$|E
