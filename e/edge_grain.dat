5000|$|Glue {{is highly}} {{effective}} for joining timber when both {{surfaces of the}} joint are <b>edge</b> <b>grain.</b> A properly glued joint may be as strong or stronger than {{a single piece of}} wood. However, glue is notably less effective on end-grain surfaces. Animal glue is soluble in water, producing joints that can be disassembled using steam to soften the glue.|$|E

End grain cutting boards showcase the tree's natural rings and hide knife marks and wear.

Here, we present a support method to detect the edge from structure images. We make blurry images clear by solving non-linear partial differential equations numerically. Combining ordinary image analysis methods, we can detect <b>edges</b> of <b>grains</b> easily. In this note, we introduce the results of our method and discuss the possibility of this method...|$|R

5000|$|Sunburst is a {{style of}} {{finishing}} for musical instruments such as electric and acoustic guitars and electric basses. At {{the center of a}} sunburst-finished surface is an area of lighter color (often showing the wood grain underneath) that darkens gradually towards the edges before hitting a dark rim. Among the best known examples of a sunburst finish are the Gibson Les Paul guitars and the Fender Stratocaster. It was originally intended to imitate an aged French polish finish, as applied to classical string instruments such as violins, as well as to enable the use of wood with less attractive <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> on high-end instruments.|$|E
50|$|Both shakes and {{shingles}} must be <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> cut, {{to prevent}} warping and splitting as the wood dries. When splitting blocks and manufacturing shakes or shingles particular {{care must be}} taken to consider the orientation of the grain in the wood. Likewise when bucking, {{care must be taken}} to ensure cuts are precisely perpendicular to the grain, to minimize waste and maintain product quality. When bucking, the log must be cleared off well, so the grain can be seen clearly, allowing straight cuts perpendicular to the grain. When splitting, the ringers are typically split from the bark to the heart, perpendicular to the grain. The heart wood is removed by splitting parallel to the grain, and the bark and sap-wood is removed, as well as any imperfections such as rot or bug holes. The initial split is always made on a knot, burl, check or other imperfection, to allow the blocks to be made as large as possible while disposing of any waste. The blocks should never be split where there is clear wood, or imperfections will be left in the block; or the block will have to be split too small in the process of removing flaws.|$|E

40|$|The atomic {{structure}} of a material influences its electronic, chemical, magnetic and mechanical properties. Characterising carbon nanomaterials, such as fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene, at the atomic level is challenging due to their chemical reactivity and low atomic mass. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy {{are two of the}} leading methods for imaging graphene at the atomic level. Here, we report on recent advances in atomic resolution imaging of graphene using aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy and how it has revealed many of the structural deviations from the pristine monolayer form.

30|$|An {{air-dried}} <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> {{board with}} the pith {{in the center}} was cut from a 20 -cm length of trunk at 1.2  m above ground. After the <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> surface was made smooth with a planer, {{the color of the}} heartwood in the <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> surface was evaluated by colorimeter (Tokyo Denshoku, TC-PIII) and with an L*a*b* color system. Color index values indicating the brightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) were obtained from the L*a*b* system based on JIS Z 8729. The spot size of color index measurement was 20  mm. For color index measurement, 3 different points with no defects on the <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> surface of heartwood were randomly selected.

30|$|To meet {{objective}} (1)—assess {{variations of}} wood {{properties in the}} rings from juvenile to mature—the tracheid length, MFA, and density of each tree were measured from the second logs. The 20 -cm-length <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> boards with the pith in the center were cut into three parts, in the longitudinal direction. Latewood tracheid length (TL) was measured from small specimens cut from the latewood of every three rings from pith to bark {{on one side of}} <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> specimens. The small specimens were macerated for measurement of TL. Density was measured from 9 to 12 small specimens of <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> wood cut from pith to bark continuously on each side. Heartwood extractives were removed by immersing samples in methanol (72  h, room temperature) and hot water (48  h, 90  °C). Density was calculated from green volume and kiln dry weight. Variation in density was measured from pith to bark on both sides. In this study, basic density is simply described as “density”. MFA of the tangential wall was measured from 24 -μm-thick tangential sections cut from latewood of every 3 – 5 rings from pith to bark on one side of <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> specimens. MFA was measured by the iodine-staining method [27]. I 2 crystallizes in gaps between microfibrils and sections were observed with a light microscope.

40|$|The {{semiconducting}} two-dimensional {{transition metal}} dichalcogenides MX 2 show {{an abundance of}} one-dimensional metallic <b>edges</b> and <b>grain</b> boundaries. Standard techniques for calculating edge states typically model nanoribbons, and {{require the use of}} supercells. In this paper, we formulate a Green's function technique for calculating edge states of (semi-) infinite two-dimensional systems with a single well-defined <b>edge</b> or <b>grain</b> boundary. We express Green's functions in terms of Bloch matrices, constructed from the solutions of a quadratic eigenvalue equation. The technique can be applied to any localized basis representation of the Hamiltonian. Here, we use it to calculate edge states of MX 2 monolayers by means of tight-binding models. Aside from the basic zigzag and armchair edges, we study edges with a more general orientation, structurally modifed <b>edges,</b> and <b>grain</b> boundaries. A simple three-band model captures {{an important part of the}} edge electronic structures. An 11 -band model comprising all valence orbitals of the M and X atoms is required to obtain all edge states with energies in the MX 2 band gap. Here, states of odd symmetry with respect to a mirror plane through the layer of M atoms have a dangling-bond character, and tend to pin the Fermi level...|$|R
30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the porosity slowly moves towards the <b>grain</b> boundary <b>edges</b> and vertices, which is energetically favourable due to the increase in interfaces. Edge and vertex adherence is therefore implicitly captured within the model. This phenomenon is observed experimentally in post-irradiation examination of irradiated fuel samples, where rounded prismatic tunnels form along the <b>grain</b> <b>edges</b> (White and Tucker 1983). With sufficient <b>grain</b> <b>edge</b> porosity, these tunnels can form an interconnected network connecting to macroscopic cracks venting the fission gas accumulated on the grain boundary faces to the free volume.|$|R
40|$|Magnetism {{arising from}} edge spins is highly interesting, {{particularly}} in 2 D atomically thin materials {{in which the}} influence of edges becomes more significant. Among such materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2; one of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family) is attracting significant attention. The causes for magnetism observed in the TMD family, including in MoS 2, have been discussed by considering various aspects, such as pure zigzag atomic-structure <b>edges,</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries, and vacancies. Here, we report the observation of ferromagnetism (FM) in few-layer MoS 2 nanomeshes (NMs; honeycomb-like array of hexagonal nanopores with low-contamination and low-defect pore edges), which have been created by a specific non-lithographic method. We confirm robust FM arising from pore edges in oxygen(O) -terminated MoS 2 -NMs at room temperature, while it disappears in hydrogen(H) -terminated samples. The observed high-sensitivity of FM to NM structures and critical annealing temperatures suggest a possibility that the Mo-atom dangling bond in pore edge is a dominant factor for the FM...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of mobile charge carriers in the space-charge regions at grain boundaries {{of ceramic materials}} was modeled. Delocalization effects are neglected, i. e., we consider ionic defects or polarons. The calculations were performed for cubic- shaped grains of equal size. When considering the size dependence, the standard free chemical potentials of the defects rather than the specific grain-boundary charge density or the defects' boundary concentration were set to be constant {{in accordance with the}} core space-charge model. Although specific edge and corner effects are neglected in the present analysis and hence the structural potentials are invariant along grain boundaries, the accumulation or depletion of charge carriers turns out to be inhomogeneous along the grain boundary and to be particularly pronounced near <b>grain</b> <b>edges</b> and <b>grain</b> corners if the grain size was smaller than four Debye lengths. Especially the accumulation near <b>grain</b> <b>edges</b> can have a strong influence on the effective conductivity (though being a purely geometric effect). The modeling also predicts that a contact of two grains that differ only in size, leads to a re{{distribution of}} mobile ions between grains, provided that either one or both grain sizes are smaller than the double width of space-charge layers.

In recent years, for effective utilization method of Japanese cedar, the functions of air purification [1] and humidity conditioning [2 – 4] of Japanese cedar have been noted.

However, Japanese cedar materials generally are often used by exposing the <b>edge</b> <b>grain</b> or flat grain surface in room.

So, the slit material of Japanese cedar is utilized in various products such as furniture and interior materials.|$|E
