50|$|<b>Gator</b> McKlusky is a {{southern}} moonshiner {{who has been}} convicted of at least four moonshining/bootlegging charges and has served two terms (a total of at least four years) in prison.

In White Lightning, <b>Gator</b> is incarcerated in Arkansas, where his parents also live, while in <b>Gator,</b> the McKluskies now live in Georgia (as evidenced by opening scenes depicting the Georgia state flag and the Georgia state capitol building).
