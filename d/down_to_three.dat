5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, maintain that this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The idea to {{construct}} a new airport for Hyderabad was first conceived around 1997 by the N. Chandrababu Naidu administration. The existing commercial airport, Begumpet Airport, was unable to handle rising passenger traffic. The State Government initially considered converting Hakimpet Air Force Station to civilian use; however, the Air Force refused. When the State proposed {{the construction of a}} new airport for the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport. By October 1998, the State had narrowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> possible locations for the new airport: Bongloor, Nadergul and Shamshabad. Due to its convenient location near two highways (NH 44 and NH 765) and a railway line, Shamshabad was selected in December 1998.|$|E

5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

Engine offerings were <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three,</b> a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch V6, or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel.|$|E

25|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{sighting of}} mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> individuals. According to various sources, three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, a {{captain in the}} Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the Royal Navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Murphy {{stepped down}} as head coach to become the team general manager, with {{assistant}} coach Mike Riley (son of former Winnipeg coach Bud Riley) taking over head-coaching duties. Then, {{just prior to the}} start of the 1987 season, the Montreal Alouettes folded. With the East Division suddenly <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> teams compared to five in the West, the league moved the Blue Bombers to the East to balance the divisions.|$|E

25|$|One {{matter of}} contention, as became visible during {{previous}} consultation, {{is the future}} building height of the residential areas. After 10–16 storey buildings proposed in 2006 met strong opposition, the July 2007 design envisages {{only a small number}} of 14-storey towers, with the main apartment strips along the eastern side of Wynyard Wharf being no higher than seven storeys at the road, stepping <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> storeys at the water's edge.|$|E

Allen missed the week three game against the Packers due to suffering from pneumonia and having lost 18 pounds. As a result, his streak of games played dating back to week two of 2007 ended. He finished 2014 with 52 tackles, 5.5 sacks, 4 passes defended, 2 forced fumbles, and 2 fumble recoveries.|$|E

25|$|In March 1945, {{the white}} majors created the Major League Committee on Baseball Integration. Its members {{included}} Joseph P. Rainey, Larry MacPhail and Branch Rickey. Because MacPhail, {{who was an}} outspoken critic of integration, kept stalling, the committee never met. Under the guise of starting an all-black league, Rickey sent scouts all around the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico, looking for the perfect candidate to break the color line. His list eventually was narrowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three,</b> Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe and Jackie Robinson.|$|E

25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, {{would be a more}} reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|E

In {{subsequent}} years, Raymond James Stadium in Tampa {{was chosen as the}} site for Super Bowl XLIII and the West Side Stadium was briefly designated as the venue for Super Bowl XLIV. However, this game was later moved to Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, {{when it became clear that}} the new stadium in New York City would not be built in time for the February 2010 game.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} pitta genera has varied considerably, ranging {{from one to}} as many as nine. In his 1863 work A Monograph of the Pittidae Daniel Elliot split the pittas into two genera, Pitta for the species with {{comparatively}} long tails and Brachyurus for the shorter tailed species. Barely two decades later, in 1880/81, John Gould split the family into nine genera, to which he also included the lesser melampitta (Melampitta), where it was kept until 1931 when Ernst Mayr demonstrated it had the syrinx was of an oscine bird. Soon afterwards Philip Sclater's Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum brought the number back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1858, Queen Victoria {{selected}} Ottawa as {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada, and Barrack Hill was chosen as the site for the new parliament buildings, given its prominence over both the town and the river, as well as {{the fact that it was}} already owned by the Crown. On 7 May, the Department of Public Works issued a call for design proposals for the new parliament buildings to be erected on Barrack Hill, which was answered with 298 submitted drawings. After the entries were narrowed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>three,</b> Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate, and the winners were announced on August 29, 1859.|$|E
