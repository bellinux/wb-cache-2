5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle</b> of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle</b> (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle</b> that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of limited arc movement on isokinetic muscle performance of the knee extensor and <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles.</b> Subjects were 10 healthy volunteers. We measured peak torque per body weight (%BW), angle of peak torque (PA), and torque acceleration energy (TAE) in each subject, under each of the following 6 conditions: isokinetic velocities of 60, 180 °/sec; range of isokinetic movement from 90 °of knee flexion to full extension, 10 °and 30 °of knee flexion. The results demonstrated significant differences in (1) %BW of the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> at 180 °/sec (p< 0. 05), (2) PA of <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> at 60 and 180 °/sec (p< 0. 01), and (3) TAE of <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> at 180 °/sec (p< 0. 05).

25|$|The various {{movements}} of the wings, especially in insects that flex their wings horizontally over their backs when at rest, demand a more complicated articular structure at the wing base than a mere hinge of the wing with the body. Each wing {{is attached to the}} body by a membranous basal area, but the articular membrane contains a number of small articular sclerites, collectively known as the pteralia. The pteralia include an anterior humeral plate {{at the base of the}} costal vein, a group of axillaries (Ax) associated with the subcostal, radial, and vannal veins, and two less definite median plates (m, m') at the base of the mediocubital area. The axillaries are specifically developed only in the wing-flexing insects, where they constitute the flexor mechanism of the wing operated by the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle</b> arising on the pleuron. Characteristic of the wing base is also a small lobe on the anterior margin of the articular area proximal to the humeral plate, which, in the forewing of some insects, is developed into a large, flat, scale-like flap, the tegula, overlapping the base of the wing. Posteriorly, the articular membrane often forms an ample lobe between the wing and the body, and its margin is generally thickened and corrugated, giving the appearance of a ligament, the so-called axillary cord, continuous mesally with the posterior marginal scutellar fold of the tergal plate bearing the wing.|$|E

40|$|Background: It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that neuromuscular function is temperature sensitive. Changes in muscle temperature may affect muscle force development. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of temperature on wrist <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> endurance. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects (mean age 21. 13 ± 1. 30 years) participated in the present study. The wrist <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> endurance was measured before and after applying ice and hot packs over the forearm for 15 minutes. Paired t tests were used to compare differences between pre and post intervention endurance. Results: The results showed a significant increase in wrist <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> endurance after heating. (P= 0. 04). We also found that, cooling the forearm muscles leaded to significant decrease of wrist <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> endurance (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: These results suggest that hand function is temperature sensitive. Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of cold on muscular function in people working in workplaces with extreme temperature...|$|R

This research aimed {{to determine the}} strength of deep and superficial cervical <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> in female students with forward head posture compared to the normal group. Methods: From the total of 724 female students in Shahid Bahonar University taking physical education I course, 60 students were enrolled into the two equal groups of with and without forward head posture. For selecting subjects, Posture screen test, New York test and lateral photography in stand position were used. Pressure Biofeedback device was applied to investigate the strength of cervical muscles during two craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) and combination test. To ensure proper performance of tests, Surface Electromyography was used. Results: The two groups showed significant difference in deep cervical muscles strengths (P= 0. 002), while {{there was no significant}} difference between the two groups in superficial <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> strength (P= 0. 803).

500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle,</b> but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle,</b> which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{quantify}} the stiffness of the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> of the elbow in spastic patients using REA plan, a robotic device used in rehabilitation that can mobilize the patient's upper limb in a horizontal plane. PatientsTwelve chronic stroke patients with hemiplegia were recruited. Spasticity of the elbow <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> was assessed with Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Their scores were greater than 1. MethodsPatients received an anaesthetic block of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, {{to reduce the}} spasticity of the elbow <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles.</b> Each patient was assessed {{before and after the}} injection of the anaesthetic block and a third time the next day. During each session, stiffness was measured with the REA plan. The robot passively mobilized the patient's upper limb at various speeds (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm/s) in a back-and-forth trajectory (30 cm). For each speed condition, ten movements were performed. We recorded the force required to passively mobilize the patient's upper limb. For the ten extension movements, the strength peaks (SP) were computed and averaged. ResultsThe results showed that the SP was significantly higher in the impaired upper limb than in the unaffected arm (p 0, 6). These last results suggested that the SP reflected the spasticity of the elbow <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles.</b> ConclusionThis study develops and validates a protocol to {{quantify the}} stiffness of the <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> of the elbow, using the robot REA plan.

2500|$|When {{a muscle}} contracts, it pulls a tendon, which acts on the horse's bones to move them. Muscles are {{commonly}} {{arranged in pairs}} so that they oppose each other (they are [...] "antagonists"), with one flexing the joint (a <b>flexor</b> <b>muscle)</b> and the other extending it (extensor muscle). Therefore, one muscle of the pair must be relaxed {{in order for the}} other muscle in the pair to contract and bend the joint properly. A muscle is made up of several muscle bundles, which in turn are made up of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers have myofibrils, which are able to contract due to actin and myosin. A muscle together with its tendon and bony attachments form an extensor or flexor unit.|$|E

This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 44 patients with chronic neck pain in 2016. The patients were randomly divided into two SE and (PNFE) groups (each containing 22 subjects). The pain of patients was assessed using VisualAnalogScale(VAS) questionnaire(VAS) and the disability was assessed using Neck Disability Index(NDI) questionnaire, and cross-sectional area of deep cervical <b>flexor</b> <b>muscles</b> in the right side was assessed using ultrasonography before treatment training and 8 weeks after the start of training. Treatment program for both groups was 8 weeks (6 sessions per week and two sessions per day) with repetition of specified trainings. Variance analysis, independent t-test, and paired t-test were used to compare results before and after treatment between groups and within groups. The mean pain score in both SE (P< 0. 001) and PNFE (P< 0. 001) groups was declined. Mean NDI in both SE (P< 0. 001) and PNFE (P< 0. 001) groups showed a significant decrease.
