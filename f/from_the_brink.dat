25|$|The genre took a huge dip in {{popularity}} {{with the emergence}} of Arabesque music. However, with Aksu backing emerging stars such as Sertab and Tarkan in the early 1990s, Turkish pop came back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink.</b> In particular, Tarkan's song Şımarık, which was both written and composed by Aksu, was a hit in Europe and Latin America in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{boycott of}} Colt {{gradually}} faded out after William M. Keys, a retired U.S. Marine Lt. General, took {{the helm of}} the company in 2002. Keys salvaged Colt's reputation and brought Colt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of bankruptcy to an international leader in Defense production. In 2010 Gerald R.

The reservoir is also seen end on to the south. The Benn and Castle Crag provide a close-up view of Raven Crag from the north.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{was among}} the first zoos in the world to breed white tigers and the common {{reticulated}} giraffe. While it has successfully bred some megafauna, its rate of breeding rare species had not been very successful, often due to lack of initiative and funding. One notable exception is the breeding programme of the Manipur brow-antlered deer, or thamin which has been brought back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction by the breeding program at the Alipore Zoo.|$|E

50|$|The gang {{decided to}} wait for the optimal time for their heist.

Costa monitored <b>the</b> depot <b>from</b> a room of a tenement building across Prince Street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brink's</b> building.

25|$|Political leaders {{soon began}} to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of war. In 1992, South African President F. W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint {{appearance}} outside South Africa.

25|$|Chief Waramaug watched sadly as {{once more}} his daughter's health began to fail and her usually happy {{disposition}} to turn morose under mounting waves of despondency. Perhaps, he thought, he might {{bring her back}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of deep depression if he could only interest her in a young man of her own race. So, unknown to Lillinonah, Waramaug arranged a marriage for her with Eagle Feather, one of the brightest, most promising braves in the Pootatuck tribe. Surely, such a fine youth as he, could give Lillinonah something to live for.|$|E

In the 1980s, Nawat had about 200 speakers. By 2009, 3,000 people were participating in Nawat language learning programs, the vast majority being young people, giving rise to hopes that the language might be pulled back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of extinction.|$|E

5000|$|On October 31, 2008, {{the son of}} Abdelkader Belliraj, Omar Belliraj, as well as Abdellatif Bekhti's brother, Abderahim Bekhti, {{appeared}} before the Correctional Court of Brussels for laundering money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brink's</b> hold up (on charges that had been slightly reduced to robbing €15,000,000). Abderahim Bekhti then said, [...] "Yes, my brother committed the hold up in Luxembourg and he took away more than 600 million Belgian francs. He was condemned to 20 years and he escaped. Then, he was taken in by Belliraj who {{told him he would}} invest the money. He invested in hotels and my brother never again saw his money. Thence, there is no whitewashing. I bought a Porsche, that's all.". The judicial correspondent of La Dernière Heure mentions that both Abderahim Bekhti and Omar Belliraj laundered the money by buying four Porsches, one Mercedes, a Honda motorcycle and a jet ski, with €500 banknotes only.|$|R
25|$|In April 1921 the Cabinet decided, against Wilson’ advice, to {{withdraw}} 4 of Macready’s 51 battalions, {{to meet the}} possible Triple Alliance strike. Wilson drew up plans to send an extra 30 battalions to suppress Ireland once the strike and the Irish elections {{were out of the}} way, not least as troops would otherwise need to be replaced after the strain of guerrilla war. In the event 17 battalions were sent (bringing British strength up to 60,000) in June and July, but the politicians drew back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> and began secret talks with James Craig and Éamon de Valera.|$|E
25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands {{that he wants to}} look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the war had}} {{severely}} exhausted the Dutch finances, the pacification of Java {{enabled the}} colonial government of Dutch East Indies to implement Cultuurstelsel ("The Culture System") in Java, without any local opposition. Implemented in 1830 by the new governor general, Johannes van den Bosch, this cultivation system requires 20% of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export or, alternatively, peasants had to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year. The policy brought the Dutch and their native allies enormous wealth through the export of cash crops. It brought the Netherlands back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of bankruptcy, and made the Dutch East Indies a self-sufficient and profitable colony.|$|E
60|$|Night had {{completely}} closed. It prevented <b>the</b> Moors <b>from</b> seeing <b>the</b> smallness {{of the force}} {{with which they were}} contending, and Don Alonso and his cavaliers dealt their blows so vigorously that, aided by the darkness, they seemed multiplied to ten times their number. Unfortunately, a small cask of gunpowder blew up near to the scene of action. It shed a momentary but brilliant light over all the plain and on every rock and cliff. The Moors beheld, with surprise, that they were opposed by a mere handful of men, and that the greater part of the Christians were flying <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field. They put up loud shouts of triumph. While some continued the conflict with redoubled ardor, others pursued the fugitives, hurling after them stones and darts and discharging showers of arrows. Many of the Christians in their terror and their ignorance of the mountains, rushed headlong <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brinks</b> of precipices and were dashed in pieces.|$|R
50|$|The region usually {{regarded}} as the Paris Basin is rather smaller than the area formed by the geological structure.

25|$|Beginning at mile 50.7 of the Skyline Drive {{near the}} Byrd Visitor Center, Dark Hollow Falls Trail leads {{downhill}} beside Hogcamp Branch to Dark Hollow Falls, a 70-foot cascade. The {{distance from the}} trailhead {{to the base of}} the falls is 0.7 mile, although the trail continues beyond that point, crossing the creek and connecting with the Rose River fire road. Various fauna can be viewed along the trail, including occasional sightings of black bear and timber rattlesnake. While the trail is relatively short, parts of it are steep and may prove challenging to some visitors. There is no view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of the falls, and slippery rocks make it inadvisable to leave the trail.|$|E
25|$|In May 2000, the {{situation}} on the ground had deteriorated to such an extent that British Paratroopers were deployed in Operation Palliser to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order. They stabilized {{the situation}}, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire that helped end the war. The British forces, under the command of Brigadier David Richards, expanded their original mandate, which was limited to evacuating commonwealth citizens, and now aimed to save UNAMSIL <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of collapse. At the time of the British intervention in May 2000, half of the country remained under the RUF’s control. The 1,200 man British ground force – supported by air and sea power – shifted the balance of power in favor of the government and the rebel forces were easily repelled from the areas beyond Freetown.|$|E
25|$|Apollo {{carried the}} baby to the centaur Chiron who raised Asclepius and {{instructed}} him {{in the art of}} medicine. It is said that in return for some kindness rendered by Asclepius, a snake licked Asclepius's ears clean and taught him secret knowledge (to the Greeks snakes were sacred beings of wisdom, healing, and resurrection). Asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing. A species of non-venomous pan-Mediterranean serpent, the Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is named for the god.Asclepius became so proficient as a healer that he surpassed both Chiron and his father, Apollo. Asclepius was therefore able to evade death and to bring others back to life <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> of death and beyond. This caused an influx of human beings and Zeus resorted to killing him to maintain balance in the numbers of the human population.|$|E
