Versions 1.3 and 2.0 {{added support}} for 1080p 60 Hz (YCbCr 4:2:2) with a bandwidth of 3 Gbit/s in PackedPixel mode. Version 3.0 increased the bandwidth to 6 Gbit/s to support 4K Ultra HD (3840 × 2160) 30Hz video, and also changed from being <b>frame-based,</b> like HDMI, to packet-based.|$|E

25|$|The {{ethernet}} is {{a family}} of <b>frame-based</b> computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC)/Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format. Robert Metcalfe, while at Xerox invented the ethernet in 1975.|$|E
500|$|Machinima has {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared to other styles of filmmaking. Its relative simplicity over traditional <b>frame-based</b> animation limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than live action. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game artificial intelligence (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through digital puppetry. [...] Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during post-production using video editing techniques. Editing, custom software, and creative cinematography may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of digital assets from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 Innovative Electronic Designs (IED) {{introduced}} the circuit card <b>frame-based</b> auto mic mixing system featuring combine-separate function and programmable gain control (PGC) modules. Combine-separate functionality {{is useful for}} ballroom applications with movable partitions that permit portions or all of a room {{to be used for}} one program or multiple programs. PGC modules compensate individual mic channel gain for soft-spoken or loud presenters, by slightly boosting or cutting channel gain, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The 3D {{capabilities}} in WPF are limited compared to what's available in Direct3D. However, WPF provides tighter integration with other features like user interface (UI), documents, and media. This {{makes it possible}} to have 3D UI, 3D documents, and 3D media. A set of built-in controls is provided as part of WPF, containing items such as button, menu, and list box controls. WPF provides the ability to perform control composition, where a control can contain any other control or layout. WPF also has a built-in set of data services to enable application developers to bind data to the controls. Images are supported using the Windows Imaging Component. For media, WPF supports any audio and video formats which Windows Media Player can play. In addition, WPF supports time-based animations, in contrast to the <b>frame-based</b> approach. This delinks the speed of the animation from how slow or fast the system is performing. [...] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType.|$|E
