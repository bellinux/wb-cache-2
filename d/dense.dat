40|$|The <b>Densest</b> k-{{subgraph}} problem (i. e. find a size k subgraph with {{maximum number}} of edges), {{is one of the}} notorious problems in approximation algorithms. There is a significant gap between known upper and lower bounds for <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph: the current best algorithm gives an ≈ O(n 1 / 4) approximation, while even showing a small constant factor hardness requires significantly stronger assumptions than P ̸ = NP. In addition to interest in designing better algorithms, a number of recent results have exploited the conjectured hardness of <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph and its variants. Thus, understanding the approximability of <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph is an important challenge. In this work, we give evidence for the hardness of approximating <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph within polynomial factors. Specifically, we expose the limitations of strong semidefinite programs from SDP hierarchies in solving <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph. Our results include: • A lower bound of Ω (n 1 / 4 / log 3 n) on the integrality gap for Ω(log n / log log n) rounds of the Sherali-Adams relaxation for <b>Densest</b> k-subgraph. This also holds for the relaxation ob...|$|R

Part of Hilbert’s eighteenth {{problem is}} to {{classify}} the symmetries of the <b>densest</b> packings of bodies in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, for instance the <b>densest</b> packings of balls or simplices.

We present {{algorithms}} of polynomial {{time as well as}} approximation results on special graph classes. Analytically, we study polynomial time algorithms for the <b>densest</b> k-subgraph problem on weighted graphs of maximal degree two, on weighted trees even if the solution is disconnected, and on interval graphs with intersection only between two consecutive cliques. Moreover, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for the <b>densest</b> k-subgraph problem on a star of cliques and a polynomial time algorithm on a tree of cliques of bounded degree. Finally, in {{the last part of the}} thesis we analyze a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the <b>densest</b> k-subgraph problem on chordal graphs.

40|$|Tumor budding is {{recognized}} by the World Health Organization as an additional prognostic factor in colorectal cancer but remains unreported in diagnostic work due {{to the absence of}} a standardized scoring method. This study aims to assess the most prognostic and reproducible scoring systems for tumor budding in colorectal cancer. Tumor budding on pancytokeratin-stained whole tissue sections from 105 well-characterized stage II patients was scored by 3 observers using 7 methods: Hase, Nakamura, Ueno, Wang (conventional and rapid method), <b>densest</b> high-power field, and 10 <b>densest</b> high-power fields. The predictive value for clinicopathologic features, the prognostic significance, and interobserver variability of each scoring method was analyzed. Pancytokeratin staining allowed accurate evaluation of tumor buds. Interobserver agreement for 3 observers was excellent for <b>densest</b> high-power field (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 83) and 10 <b>densest</b> high-power fields (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 91). Agreement was moderate to substantial for the conventional Wang method (κ = 0. 46 - 0. 62) and moderate for the rapid method (κ = 0. 46 - 0. 58). For Nakamura, moderate agreement (κ = 0. 41 - 0. 52) was reached, whereas concordance was fair to moderate for Ueno (κ = 0. 39 - 0. 56) and Hase (κ = 0. 29 - 0. 51). The Hase, Ueno, <b>densest</b> high-power field, and 10 <b>densest</b> high-power field methods identified a significant association of tumor budding with tumor border configuration. In multivariate analysis, only tumor budding as evaluated in <b>densest</b> high-power field and 10 <b>densest</b> high-power fields had significant prognostic effects on patient survival (P <. 01), with high prognostic accuracy over the full 10 -year follow-up. Scoring tumor buds in 10 <b>densest</b> high-power fields is a promising method to identify stage II patients at high risk for recurrence in daily diagnostics; it is highly reproducible, accounts for heterogeneity, and has a strong predictive value for adverse outcome...|$|R

40|$|The <b>densest</b> local {{packings}} of N three-dimensional identical nonoverlapping spheres {{within a}} radius Rmin(N) of a fixed central sphere {{of the same}} size are obtained for selected values of N up to N = 1054. In the predecessor to this paper [A. B. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 81 041305 (2010) ], we described our method for finding the putative <b>densest</b> packings of N spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd and presented those packings in R 2 for values of N up to N = 348. We analyze the properties and characteristics of the <b>densest</b> local packings in R 3 and employ knowledge of the Rmin(N), using methods applicable in any d, to construct both a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In R 3, we find wide variability in the <b>densest</b> local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare the <b>densest</b> local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy configurations of N+ 1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and long-range attractive pair potentials, e. g., 12 - 6 Lennard-Jones, and find that they are in general completely different, a result that has possible implications for nucleation theory. We also compare the <b>densest</b> local packings to finite subsets of stacking variants of the <b>densest</b> infinite packings in R 3 (the Barlow packings) and find that the <b>densest</b> local packings are almost always most similar, as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about a single central sphere, e. g., a subset of the FCC Barlow packing. We additionally observe that the <b>densest</b> local packings are dominated by the spheres arranged with centers at precisely distance Rmin(N) from the fixed sphere's center.
