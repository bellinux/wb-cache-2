40|$|The {{expressions}} <b>few</b> and a <b>few</b> {{are typically}} {{considered to be}} separate quantifiers. I challenge this assumption, showing that with the appropriate definition of <b>few,</b> a <b>few</b> can be derived compositionally as a + <b>few.</b> The core of the analysis is a proposal that <b>few</b> has a denotation as a one-place predicate which incorporates a negation operator. From this, argument interpretations can be derived for expressions such as <b>few</b> students and a <b>few</b> students, differing only in the scope of negation. I show that this approach adequately captures the interpretive differences between <b>few</b> and a <b>few.</b> I further show that other such pairs are blocked by a constraint against the vacuous application of a. ...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have <b>fewer</b> than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have <b>fewer</b> than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have <b>fewer</b> than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.
