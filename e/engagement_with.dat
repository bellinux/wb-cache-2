5|$|By {{applying}} post-structuralist {{theory to}} anarchism, Newman presents {{an account of}} post-anarchism. His post-anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers, and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy.

5|$|To {{understand}} his character's world-view, McEwan {{spent time with}} a neurosurgeon. The novel explores one's <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> the modern world {{and the meaning of}} existence in it. The main character, though outwardly successful, still struggles to understand meaning in his life, exploring personal satisfaction in the post-modern, developed world. Though intelligent and well read, Perowne feels he has little influence over political events.|$|E
5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{force of}} 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned, with Alligator {{mounting}} only 12 six-pounders, {{compared to the}} pirates' 14 cannon. Despite being outnumbered, Alligator and her crew were experienced veterans, having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action. Allen was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> HMS Pelican in the War of 1812. Though Alligator draft was too deep to chase pirate craft inshore, if need be, she could send her cutter, gig, and launch out with boarding parties to engage the pirates.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and the excitement of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> Harwood's cruisers.|$|E

Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the <b>engagement,</b> <b>with</b> most of the crews being rescued.|$|E

5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style.

He also advocated <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.

These tactics range from <b>engagement</b> <b>with</b> the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
