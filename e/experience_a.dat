5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to experience an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to experience an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity.

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event compared to their actual chance of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of <b>experiencing</b> <b>an</b> event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of <b>experiencing</b> <b>an</b> event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|R
