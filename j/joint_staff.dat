5|$|Under the 1943 Quebec Agreement {{with the}} United Kingdom, nuclear weapons {{would not be}} used against another country without mutual consent. Stimson {{therefore}} had to obtain British permission. A meeting of the Combined Policy Committee {{was held at the}} Pentagon on July 4, 1945. Stimson and Vannevar Bush represented the United States; Britain was represented by the head of the British <b>Joint</b> <b>Staff</b> Mission, Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson; and Canada by Clarence D. Howe. In addition, Harvey Bundy, Sir James Chadwick, Groves, Lord Halifax, George L. Harrison, and Roger Makins were all present at the meeting by invitation.|$|E

Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British <b>Joint</b> <b>Staff</b> Mission and {{as a member of the}} Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson.|$|E
5|$|By March 1943 Conant {{decided that}} British help would benefit {{some areas of}} the project. James Chadwick and one or two other British {{scientists}} were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D.

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British <b>Joint</b> <b>Staff</b> Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
