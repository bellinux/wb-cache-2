40|$|Due to its proximity, {{the mass}} of the supermassive black hole in the nucleus of Andromeda galaxy (M 31), the most massive black hole in the Local Group of galaxies, has been {{measured}} by several methods involving the kinematics of a stellar disk that surrounds it. We report here the discovery of an eccentric Halpha <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> around the black hole at the center of M 31 and show how modeling this disk can provide an independent determination of {{the mass of}} the black hole. Our model implies a mass of 5. 0 _{- 1. 0 }^{+ 0. 8 } x 10 ^ 7 Mo for the central black hole, consistent with the average of determinations by methods involving stellar dynamics, and compatible (at 1 -sigma level) with measurements obtained from the most detailed models of the stellar disk around the central black hole. This value is also consistent with the M-sigma relation. In order to make a comparison, we applied our simulation on the stellar kinematics in the nucleus of M 31 and concluded that the parameters obtained for the stellar disk are not formally compatible with the parameters obtained for the Halpha <b>emitting</b> <b>disk.</b> This result suggests that the stellar and the Halpha emitting disks are intrinsically different from each other. A plausible explanation is that the Halpha emission is associated with a gaseous disk. This hypothesis is supported by the detection of traces of weaker nebular lines in the nuclear region of M 31. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Halpha emission is, at least partially, generated by stars. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for understanding the dynamical and spectral properties of X-ray Binaries, where {{the presence of an}} organized large scale magnetic field plays a major role. Such a field is threading the whole accretion disk with an amplitude measured by the disk magnetization μ(r,t) =B_z^ 2 /(μ_o P_tot), where P_tot is the total, gas and radiation, pressure. Below a transition radius r_J, a jet <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> (the JED) is settled and drives self-collimated non relativistic jets. Beyond r_J, no jet is produced despite the presence of the magnetic field and a standard accretion disc (the SAD) is established. The radial distribution of the disk magnetization μ adjusts itself to any change of the disk accretion rate ṁ, thereby modifying the transition radius r_J. We propose that a SAD-to-JED transition occurs locally, at a given radius, in a SAD when μ=μ_max≃ 1 while the reverse transition occurs in a JED only when μ=μ_min≃ 0. 1. This bimodal behavior of the accretion disk provides a promising way to explain the hysteresis cycles followed by X-ray binaries during outbursts.

The hot solution possess the global observed characteristics of what has been often called a "corona" located above the inner disk region.

40|$|Long-baseline {{interferometric}} observations {{obtained with}} the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer of the H-alpha-emitting envelopes of the Be stars eta Tauri and beta Canis Minoris are presented. For compatibility with the previously published interferometric {{results in the}} literature of other Be stars, circularly symmetric and elliptical Gaussian models were fitted to the calibrated H-alpha observations. The models are sufficient in characterizing the angular distribution of the H-alpha-emitting circumstellar material associated with these Be stars. To study the correlations between the various model parameters and the stellar properties, the model parameters for eta Tau and beta CMi were combined with data for other Be stars from the literature. After accounting for the different distances to the sources and stellar continuum flux levels, it was possible to study the relationship between the net H-alpha emission and the physical extent of the H-alpha-emitting circumstellar region. A clear dependence of the net H-alpha emission on the linear size of the emitting region is demonstrated and these results are consistent with an optically thick line emission that is directly proportional to the effective area of the <b>emitting</b> <b>disk.</b> Within the small sample of stars considered in this analysis, no clear dependence on the spectral type or stellar rotation is found, although the results do suggest that hotter stars might have more extended H-alpha-emitting regions.

40|$|X-ray heating of the {{photosphere}} of an {{accretion disk}} {{is a possible}} mechanism to produce strong, broad UV emission lines in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). However, detailed photoionization calculations show that this mechanism fails to produce sufficient emission measure. We present the results of hydrodynamical calculations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong X-rays. We attempt to determine whether LMXBs can harbor significant UV-driven disk winds despite the effects of X-ray ionization. Such winds would be a likely candidate for the site of emission of UV lines and may better explain the observations than the X-ray heated disk photosphere. We find that the local disk radiation cannot launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing radiation from the central object. Unphysically high X-ray opacities {{would be required to}} shield the UV <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> and allow the line force to drive a disk wind. However the same X-ray radiation that inhibits line driving heats the disk and can produce a hot bipolar wind or corona above the disk. To assess the impact of X-ray heating upon driving of a disk wind by the line force in any system with an accretion disk we derive analytic formulae. In particular, we compare results of line-driven disk wind models for accretion disks in LMXBs and active galactic nuclei. The latter show spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind. The key parameter determining the role of the line force is not merely the presence of the luminous UV zone in the disk and the presence of the X-rays, but also the distance of this UV zone from the center.

40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} {{are one of}} {{the prime}} sites to search for dark matter (DM) annihilation signals. Depending on the substructure of the DM halo of a galaxy cluster and the cross sections for DM annihilation channels, these signals might be detectable by the latest generation of γ-ray telescopes. Here we use three years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, which are the most suitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals statistically significant extended emission which can be well characterized by a uniformly <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> profile with a radius of 3 that moreover is offset from the cluster center. We demonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends on the adopted interstellar emission model (IEM) and is most likely an artifact of our incomplete description of the IEM in this region. We also search for and find new point source candidates in the region. We then derive conservative upper limits on the velocity-averaged DM pair annihilation cross section from Virgo. We take into account the potential γ-ray flux enhancement due to DM sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. For DM annihilating into bb, assuming a conservative sub-halo model setup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1. 5 orders of magnitude above the expectation from the thermal cross section for m_DM≲ 100 GeV. In a more optimistic scenario, we exclude 〈σ v 〉∼ 3 × 10 ^- 26 cm^ 3 s^- 1 for m_DM≲ 40 GeV for the same channel. Finally, we derive upper limits on the γ-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-ray interactions in the inter cluster medium.

40|$|Context: A {{fraction}} of active galactic nuclei (AGN) show dramatic X-ray spectral {{changes on the}} day-to-week time scales associated with variation {{in the line of}} sight of the cold absorber. Aims: We intend to model the polarization fluctuations arising from an obscuration event, thereby offering a method of determining whether flux variations are due to occultation or extreme intrinsic emission variability. Methods: Undertaking 1 - 100 keV polarimetric simulations with the Monte Carlo code STOKES, we simulated the journey of a variety of cold gas clouds in front of an extended primary source. We varied the hydrogen column density nH and size of the absorber, as well as the initial polarization state of the emitting source, to cover a wide range of scenarios. Results: For unpolarized primary fluxes, large (about 50 deg) variations of the polarization position angle psi are expected before and after an occultation event, which is associated with very low residual polarization degrees (P lower than 1 per cent). In the case of an <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> with intrinsic, position-independent polarization, and for a given range of parameters, X-ray eclipses significantly alter the observed polarization spectra, with most of the variations seen in psi. Finally, non-uniformly polarized emitting regions produce very distinctive polarization variations due to the successive covering and uncovering of different portions of the disk. Plotted against time, variations in P and psi form detectable P~Cygni type profiles that are distinctive signatures of non-axisymmetric emission. Conclusions: Polarization measurements are thus particularly adapted to distinguish between intrinsic intensity fluctuations and external eclipsing events, constrain the geometry of the covering medium, and test the hypothesis of non-uniformly emitting disks predicted by general relativity.

We give a detail analysis of variation in the broad Ha and Hb profiles, the ratios, and the Balmer decrement of different line segments. Studying the variability of the line profiles we explore the disk structure, that is assumed to emit the broad double-peaked Ha and Hb emission lines. We divided the observed spectra in two periods (before and after the outburst in 2002) and analyzed separately the variation in these two periods. First we analyzed the spectral emission-line profiles of Ha and Hb, measuring the peak positions. Then, we divided lines into several segments, and we measured the line-segment fluxes. The Balmer decrement variation for total Ha and Hb fluxes, {{as well as for}} the line segments has been investigated and discussed. We modeled the line parameters variation using an accretion disk model. We compared the variability in the observed line parameters with the disk model predictions and found that the variation in line profiles and in line segments corresponds to the emission of a disk-like BLR. But, also there is probably one additional emission component that contributes to the Ha and Hb line center. We found that the variation in the line profiles is caused by the variation in the parameters of the disk-like BLR, first of all in the inner (outer) radius which can well explain the line parameter variations in the Period I. The Balmer decrement across the line profile has a bell-like shape, and it is affected not only by physical processes in the disk, but also by different <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> dimension of the Ha and Hb line. The geometry of the BLR of 3 C 390. 3 seems to be very complex, and inflows/outflows might be present, but it is evident that the broad line region with disk-like geometry has dominant emission.

40|$|Abridged] Context. The high-energy {{radiation}} from black-hole binaries {{may be due}} to the reprocessing of a lamp located on the black hole axis, emitting X-rays. The observed spectrum is made of 3 components: the direct spectrum; the thermal bump; and the reflected spectrum made of the Compton hump and the iron-line complex. Aims. We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum (thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band. We also determine the strength of the direct component. Our choice of parameters is adapted to a source showing an important thermal component. Methods. We compute in full GR the illumination of a thin disk by a lamp along the rotation axis. We use the ATM 21 radiative transfer code to compute the spectrum <b>emitted</b> along the <b>disk.</b> We ray trace this local spectrum to determine the reprocessed spectrum as observed at infinity. We discuss the dependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle and spin. Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk specific intensity spectrum emitted by the illuminated atmosphere when the thermal disk emission if fully taken into account. High spin implies high temperature in the inner regions, so the <b>emitted</b> thermal <b>disk</b> spectrum covers the iron-line complex. As a result we locally observe absorption lines produced in the hot disk atmosphere. Absorption lines are narrow and disappear after ray tracing the local spectrum. Conclusions. Our results mainly highlight the importance of considering the angle dependence of the local spectrum when computing reprocessed spectra, as was already found in a recent study. The main new result of our work is to show the importance of computing the thermal bump of the spectrum, as this feature can change considerably the observed iron-line complex.

40|$|The N-galaxy 3 C 390. 3 {{has been}} {{monitored}} spectroscopically since 1974 (Osterbrock, Koski and Phillips 1975; Oke 1988). From various archives and literature, {{it is found}} that the Balmer lines change their intensities and profiles in a dramatic manner. The H alpha profile is very broad and peculiar, and the relative intensities of its two humps changes consistently with time, possibly periodically. Before 1980, the blue hump was significantly stronger than the one in the red. From 1980 to 1983 the blue hump became stronger (see Oke 1988). After 1983 the H alpha profile has returned to its early shape and seems to have completed a full circle. Unlike the rapid (on the order of a month or even less) and aperiodic variation in the continuum and integrated line intensities, the change in broad profile seems slow and consistent. Taking the analogy of cataclysmic variables, the double-horn profiles have been observed in cases of interacting stars. For example, the emission lines, both in He II and hydrogen Balmer lines in GD 552 (Stover 1985) show double-horn profiles and periodical changes in their line profiles, including the change in ratios of two humps. It is understood that the D-wave components (Smak 1976) are the signature of an <b>emitting</b> <b>disk</b> and the S-wave component is from the emission at a hot spot which rotates and results in a moving component in the velocity space. The mass flow from the nearby interacting star provides the stream toward the core of a neutron star or white dwarf. Therefore, it is proposed that the variation of broad line profiles observed in 3 C 390. 3 {{may be the result of}} a pair of interacting massive cores. The rotational velocity dominates and produces a variable double-horn profile. However, the line widths observed in broad line radio galaxies are one order larger than that in interacting stars. The Balmer decrements imply a much smaller density (10 (exp 10 - 12) cm(exp- 3)) than that in the cataclysmic variables. The much larger velocity and much thinner density make it unlikely that the broad line emission is simply formed in an accretion disk. The authors postulate that a significant rotational motion is involved. If the observed squared profiles are indeed due to the rotational velocity field, one can naturally explain their rare occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-ray {{binaries}} are {{systems that}} comprise a compact object orbiting a companion star and display the maximum of the non-thermal Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) in gamma rays. Currently we know five gamma-ray binaries. All of them host an early type star and a compact object of unknown nature, either {{a black hole}} or a neutron star, except {{for one of them}} where radio pulsations have been detected. The optical emission received from gamma-ray binaries is produced by the optical star and its environment. If the optical star is a Be star, then it presents a circumstellar decretion disk, being its size traced by the Equivalent Width of the Halpha line (EW). Numerical simulations of gamma-ray binaries hosting a Be star suggest that the circumstellar decretion disk is perturbed/disrupted during the periastron passage of the compact object by the tidal forces and/or the putative pulsar wind. The circumstellar disk contribution to the optical photometry is a significant fraction of the total optical emission. The observed optical photometric flux from it will be proportional to the projected area of the optically <b>emitting</b> <b>disk.</b> Therefore, any orbital variability in the optical light curves can be associated to changes in the circumstellar disk. We conducted long-term optical photometric and EW observations of the gamma-ray binary LS I + 61 303, aimed to unveil the optical superorbital variability seen at other wavelengths. We obtained the following results from the observations: 1) The optical photometry and EW present a superorbital variability of the orbital phase of the maximum, as seen in radio and X-rays, providing an evidence of the coupling between the thermal and non-thermal emission processes in LS I + 61 303. 2) The optical observations present a superorbital variability of the flux compatible with the 1667 d superorbital period. 3) This superorbital variability is attenuated or missing in some orbital phases. 4) Orbital variability in a multi-wavelength context presents lags that can be naturally interpreted considering different emitting regions. 5) The observations seem to be only compatible with an extended and (quasi) -coplanar circumstellar disk. 6) The observations are compatible with a density wave scenario, and with a very restrictive precessing-disk model. Gamma-ray binaries hosting a massive star and a young non-accreting pulsar present strong interaction between the relativistic pulsar wind, and the wind of the stellar companion, resulting in efficient particle acceleration and in the production of non-thermal radiation, from radio to gamma rays. The study of the dynamical interaction between the winds can be conducted through numerical simulations, allowing a qualitative analysis of the radiative output of the system. Furthermore, the two-wind interaction region might suffer the impact of an inhomogeneous stellar wind (hereafter clumps), making its dynamics and hence its radiative output more complex. We conducted RHD simulations of the interaction of relativistic winds from young pulsars with inhomogeneous stellar winds aimed to provide a plausible framework for the high-energy variability observed in gamma-ray binaries. We obtained the following results from the numerical simulations: 1) The two-wind interaction structure is very unstable and sensitive to the tiniest perturbations, which lead to quick Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and in particular Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability growth. 2) The arrival of clumps can have a very strong impact on the whole interaction structure, which is expected to strongly affect the non-thermal radiation as well. 3) The clumps trigger violent RT/KH instabilities leading to quick changes of the shocked pulsar-wind region. 4) Clumps generate quick and global variations in the shocked pulsar wind. This can lead to strong short time-scale flux variability in the non-thermal radiation of gamma-ray binaries...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{expression}} for the γ − γ absorption coefficient, αγγ, for γ-rays propagating in an arbitrary direction at an arbitrary point in space above an X-ray <b>emitting</b> accretion <b>disk.</b> The X-ray intensity {{is assumed to}} vary as a power law in energy and radius between the outer disk radius, R 0, and the inner radius, Rms, which is the radius of marginal stability for a Schwarzschild black hole. We use our result for αγγ to calculate the γ − γ optical depth, τγγ, for γ-rays created at height z and propagating at angle Φ relative to the disk axis, and we show that for Φ = 0 and z> ∼ R 0, τγγ ∝ E α z − 2 α− 3, where α is the X-ray spectral index and E is the γ-ray energy. As an application, we use our formalism to compute the minimum distance between the central black hole and the site of production of the γ-rays detected by EGRET during the June 1991 flare of 3 C 279. In order to obtain an upper limit, we assume {{that all of the}} X-rays observed contemporaneously by Ginga were <b>emitted</b> by the <b>disk.</b> Our results suggest that the observed γ-rays may have originated within ∼ 10 9 M⊙, perhaps in active plasma located above the central funnel of the accretion disk. This raises the possibility of establishing a direct connection between the production of the observed γ-rays and the accretion of material onto the black hole. We also consider the variation of the optical depth {{as a function of the}} angle of propagation Φ. Our results indicate that the “focusing ” of the γ-rays along the disk axis due to pair production is strong enough to explain the observed degree of alignment in blazar sources. If the γ-rays are produced isotropically in γ-ray blazars, then these objects should appear as bright MeV sources when viewed along off-axis lines of sight. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model to explain the high {{frequency}} QPOs (kHz-QPOs) observed in LMXBs. The idea consists to add a rotating asymmetric component in either the gravitational or magnetic field of the accreting star. We show that the linear stability analysis of a disk evolving in such a structure predicts the existence of 3 instability types: a corotation resonance, a parametric resonance and a resonance due to a driving force, similar to the Lindblad resonance. These results are generalized by performing 2 D non-linear simulations using a pseudo-spectral method. Lastly, we discuss the observational consequences of these instabilities on the light curves <b>emitted</b> by the <b>disk,</b> allowing later a confrontation with the observations...|$|R
