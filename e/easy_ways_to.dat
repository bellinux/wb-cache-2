25|$|The work on {{interpretation}} {{and analysis of}} genome data {{is still in its}} initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as Myriad Genetics, started offering <b>easy</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, hemostasis disorders, cystic fibrosis, liver diseases and many others. Also, the etiologies for cancers, Alzheimer's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.|$|E
25|$|For its part, the Armada del Océano {{commanded}} by Don Fadrique, better prepared, sailed from Cadiz on 31 July toward Cape St. Vincent, where {{he waited for}} the other two divisions, but realizing soon that they will not arrive in time for the planned attack. Despite its strategic importance, the Armada del Océano far from having the power it had in other times, it was reduced to the flagship Santa Teresa, a mighty galleon among the bests in Europe at that time, three other much smaller, about 450 tons, three more around 330 tons and two tenders of small military value except as scouts and messengers. Such a force could not be enough against the enemy planned, and was, of course, much lower than initially planned. But Fadrique, one of the greatest admirals at the time, were not of those admirals that were seeking <b>easy</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> evade the combat, complain about everything or blaming others for the planned fiasco. On August 6, he received a notice from Don Gaspar Ruiz de Preda, major of the city of Málaga, which notified him that he had seen more than 26 Dutch sails anchoring two miles from the city preparing to cross the strait.|$|E
