25|$|Baggott {{felt that}} the CERN people were <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> close to {{discovering}} the Higgs boson and approached his editor about writing on the topic. His idea was to start writing the book, get about 95% done, and then, when the discovery was announced, {{he would be able}} to finish the last 5% and the book would be on the shelves very soon after the announcement. Throughout 2011 and 2012 he kept updating the book, leaving the last 1,500 words unsaid. He watched CERN's live webcast announce the discovery of the boson on July 4 and finished writing the book the next day.|$|E

The video commences with footage from the live concert in which he asks the audience: [...] "It's <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> hot in here, can I take my shirt off?". Several scenes display the singer loitering around a shopping centre, dancing in a nightclub, and driving around the city at night. He is also shown dancing with various female companions and hugging {{a few of his}} friends. The visual ends with Iyanya drinking vodka around the aforementioned ladies. Boye appreciated the clip and Iyanya for ending the year off right.|$|E
500|$|Cuomo {{was embarrassed}} by Pinkerton's {{reception}} and the confessional {{nature of its}} songs. In August 1997, he wrote: [...] "This has been a tough year. It's not just {{that the world has}} said Pinkerton isn't worth a shit, but that the Blue album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the [...] video. I'm a shitty songwriter." [...] In 2001, he told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent five}} months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and {{recording}} {{what would become}} Never Say Die!. [...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> drugged out, {{doing a lot of}} dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics; many were {{more critical of}} the episode than [...] "Christmas Carol". Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote {{that he did not}} [...] "totally buy “Emily” [...] even though I like large portions of" [...] the episode. VanDerWerff wrote positively of [...] "most of the Scully scenes", noting that Anderson [...] "found some of the raw sense of hope and loss" [...] that the shots required. However, he was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only [...] "goes through the motions" [...] and [...] "is about everybody <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> worked up over a little girl we’ve just met." [...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully a bit more than necessary. Unlike the later mythology episodes, however, this one manages to avoid any unnecessary new elements." ...|$|E

"The initial {{impetus for}} {{creating}} the Xeric Foundation was frustration -- when the Turtle thing started <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> huge, people started {{coming out of the}} woodwork to ask for money.

2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was <b>getting</b> <b>really</b> mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
