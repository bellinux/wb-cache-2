5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E

500|$|Director Robert Jason, who {{previously}} directed the Style Network documentary [...] "Style Exposed: Born Male, Living Female," [...] about four transgender New Yorkers, said Jackson {{will play a}} prominent part in the finished product. [...] "Janet Jackson will take us on a visually innovative, cerebral journey through the turbulent lives of transgendered [...] {{people of all ages}} around the world and their epic struggle for equality," [...] he said in a statement announcing the project. [...] "This film will highlight landmark mainstream stories and provide a glimpse at others that will change the gender landscape of the world forever. Just as it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there ever was a time when different components of society were required to use separate drinking fountains, it is as incredible that one's gender expression remains just such a target for discrimination." [...] Jackson is working behind-the-scenes on the movie and will also take part in some of the on-camera interviews as well.|$|E

2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> (as is {{sometimes}} implied) [...] "affective" [...] devotion suddenly [...] "began" [...] {{in the late}} eleventh century.

Probably this strain of personal devotion was taken up and given memorable literary form by powerful intellects like Anselm and Bernard, and with the weight of their authority as leaders and spokesmen of the ascetic and eremitic revival became the accepted and expected form of expression.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for [...] "invasion of privacy".

2500|$|In addition, it {{is known}} that the Slavic word [...] "mzec" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as [...] "having his eyes closed" [...] or [...] "be blind". Yet again, today it is almost certain that this legend was used as a metaphor, in allusion to the old Slavic pagan ceremony known as the [...] "postrzyżyny": During that ceremony hair cutting was performed to every boy at the age of seven. In that symbolic rite a child became a man. That explains that Mieszko wasn't blind in fact. He was blind only metaphorically. Besides his son's name was also Mieszko and it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he was also blind. In addition, as we know today ancient Slavs used only abstract names among nobility.|$|E

2500|$|Another scholar {{contends that}} the {{minority}} leader position emerged even before 1883. On the Democratic side, [...] "there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873," [...] indicating that the [...] "nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership." [...] Further, when Republicans were in the minority, the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers, including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875, former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio, in 1876, 1877, and 1879, and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> House partisans would place {{a man in the}} speakership when in the majority, and nominate him for this office when in the minority, and not look to him for legislative guidance."
