Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

25|$|Treating {{the story}} of Dong Hai Chuan and Guo Yunshen as allegory, however, reveals a common {{training}} protocol among Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang practitioners. Often, because Bagua Zhang requires significantly more time for a practitioner's skill to mature, it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> learn Xing Yi Quan first or simultaneously. Such a practitioner develops a tactical vocabulary that is more readily apparent than the core Bagua Zhang movements.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} names {{is governed by}} strict norms in {{traditional}} Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in Korean culture. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders. It <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> call someone {{by his or her}} given name {{if he or she is}} the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's age is a year older than the speaker. This is often a source of pragmatic difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> {{transfer}} food to {{closely related}} people (e.g. grandparents, parents, spouse, children, or significant others) {{if they are}} having difficulty picking up the food. Also {{it is a sign}} of respect to pass food to the elderly first before the dinner starts. Often, family members will transfer a choice piece of food from a dish to a relative's bowl as a sign of caring. A variation of this is to transfer the food whilst using one's own bowl as a support, underneath the food and chopsticks to keep food from falling or dripping, then transferring from there to a relative's bowl.|$|E

25|$|Historical factors {{played a}} major role in shaping the Polish usage of honorifics. Poland’s history of nobility was the major source for Polish politeness, which {{explains}} how the honorific male-marked pronoun pan (pani is female-marked) was derived from the old word for “lord.” There are separate honorific pronouns used to address a priest (ksiądz), a nun or nurse (siostra). It <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> replace siostra with pani when addressing a nurse, but it is unacceptable when speaking to a nun. Likewise, it is unacceptable to replace ksiądz with pan when speaking to a priest. The intimate T form is marked as neutral when used reciprocally between children, relatives, students, soldiers and young people.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{difficult}} to determine which teachers had most influence on Rabbi Dessler, it is apparent that he is a child of the yeshiva world of the early 20th century, which was then influenced heavily by the ethical Mussar movement, but has similarly gained proficiency in Kabbalah and works of Hasidic Judaism and Jewish philosophy. His method in interpreting tenets of Jewish philosophy reveals an adherence to the principles of the Maharal (Rabbi Loeb of Prague, 16th century). Another major influence appears to have been the 19th century Hasidic work, Tanya. Rabbi Dessler did, however, maintain that it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.|$|E
25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they perceive to be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E

25|$|An {{ambulance}} {{with only}} EMTs {{is considered a}} Basic Life Support (BLS) unit, an ambulance utilizing AEMTs is dubbed an Intermediate Life Support (ILS), or limited Advanced Life Support (LALS) unit, and an ambulance with Paramedics is dubbed an Advanced Life Support (ALS) unit. Some states allow ambulance crews to contain a mix of crews levels (e.g. an EMT and a Paramedic or an AEMT and a Paramedic) to staff ambulances and operate {{at the level of}} the highest trained provider. There is nothing stopping supplemental crew members to be of a certain certification, though (e.g. if an ALS ambulance is required to have two Paramedics, then it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> have two Paramedics and an EMT). An emergency vehicle with only EMRs or a combination of both EMRs and EMTs is still dubbed a Basic Life Support (BLS) unit. An EMR must be overseen by an EMT or higher to work on an ambulance.|$|E

The ConservativeHome website described it as [...] "crass, tasteless and unfunny as it gets", while Melanie Phillips in The Spectator commented on the intended humorous aspect of the film by writing that [...] "The joke was only about blowing dissenters to bits and raining their flesh down on terrified people. Because exterminating human beings <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> greens as a joke. From which we can only assume at best indifference towards and at worst a profound loathing of the human condition".|$|E
500|$|Hi-5, and {{the related}} {{television}} series, were designed by educational experts to appeal to contemporary, [...] "media-literate" [...] children by relating to their world. With the group being described as [...] "for the kids of today", Hi-5 has been seen to evolve with the times, updating music and designing new looks and costumes to stay [...] "abreast of the times". One of the unique features of Hi-5 is that the cast are presented as older siblings to the children, educating the audience in a fun and entertaining way, through [...] "play based learning", rather than appearing as adults who are teaching them. The educational aspects of the group's content are disguised with music and entertainment, with the multiple layers of the show catering {{to a wide range}} of ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris stated the group was careful about body-image issues, also believing Hi-5 helped to influence fashion in young people, and acknowledging it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> [...] "enjoy the fact there are differences between boys and girls and men and women".|$|E
500|$|The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are {{the first}} known {{documents}} in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the [...] "Judenevakuierung" [...] or [...] "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination. At {{one point in the}} speech, Himmler says: [...] "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of [...] "elimination" [...] (Ausschaltung) before going on to say [...] "extermination" [...] (Ausrottung). His hesitation in the middle of saying [...] "elimination" [...] can be considered as a quick mental check {{to see whether or not}} it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> use such words in front of his given audience. The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his Total War speech on February 18, 1943, begins to say [...] "Ausrottung des Judentums" [...] ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying [...] "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly. His resulting phrasing is [...] "Ausrott... schaltung des Judentums", which can be likened to [...] "exterm... elimination" [...] in English.|$|E

500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it is for us to convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it <b>is</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>to</b> pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E
