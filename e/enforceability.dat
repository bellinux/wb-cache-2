5|$|On 13 December, after a British {{merchant}} vessel had been boarded and its crew briefly arrested, the British demanded an apology, {{and failing to}} receive it, launched a bombardment of Venezuelan forts at Puerto Cabello, assisted by the German SMS Vineta. The same day, London and Berlin received from Washington a request forwarded from Castro to submit the dispute to arbitration, which neither Power relished, because of concerns over <b>enforceability</b> of any settlement. In addition, Castro's offer initially covered only claims arising from the 1898 civil war, and {{made no mention of}} other claims. Germany believed that these claims should not be subject to arbitration, but London was more willing to agree, accepting arbitration in principle, and suggested a compromise.The threat of arbitration made London move to the next stage in order to negotiate from a position of strength, and 20 December was set for the begin of the official blockade. As a result of a combination of communications issues and practical delays, the British notice of an official blockade was published on 20 December, but the German blockade of Puerto Cabello was only effected on 22 December, and on Maracaibo on 24 December.|$|E

25|$|Several {{companies}} {{targeted by}} SHAC in the UK obtained injunctions. These include HLS itself, Chiron UK, Phytopharm, Daiichi UK, Asahi Glass, Eisai, Yamanouchi Pharma, Sankyo Pharma, and BOC. The injunctions compelled SHAC to print the injunction on their website, so that SHAC's action targets were juxtaposed with a legal notification {{that there was}} a 50-yard exclusion zone around the homes of employees and places of business. Protest outside HLS itself was allowed to occur one day a week with a police presence. HLS tried but failed in June 2004 to obtain a permanent injunction against SHAC. SHAC's argument against the <b>enforceability</b> of such injunctions was that, despite having hundreds of supporters, a website, mailing address, telephone information hotline, mailing list, and bank account, it does not exist as a corporate or charitable body, and therefore cannot prevent its supporters from taking action against HLS.|$|E
500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent, {{with which}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined. Justice David Souter joined all {{sections}} of Stevens' dissent besides {{a critique of}} previous decision of the Supreme Court in arbitration case law. Stevens examined the history of arbitration {{and the purpose of}} it throughout the century. The Federal Arbitration Act was designed, he explained, to maintain the <b>enforceability</b> of contractual agreements. But private arbitration is a whole other situation. Stevens wrote, [...] "As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor’s opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts". He went on to quote the former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak in supporting the idea that the Court should look at the purpose of the act rather than its pure statutory language.|$|E
500|$|Conference {{notes and}} draft {{decisions}} illustrate {{the division of}} opinions before the decision was issued. Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy. Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined {{to the view that}} segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that [...] "we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out." [...] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's <b>enforceability.</b> Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice. Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster. However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: [...] "These [...] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes." [...] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.|$|E
500|$|Bonds met Susann ("Sun") Margreth Branco, {{the mother}} of his first two {{children}} (Nikolai and Shikari), in Montreal, Quebec in August 1987. They eloped to Las Vegas February 5, 1988. The couple separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994, and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the Catholic Church. The divorce was a media affair because Bonds had his Swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she [...] "waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings" [...] and which was upheld. Bonds had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support {{at the time of the}} ruling. During the hearings to set permanent support levels, allegations of abuse came from both parties. The trial dragged on for months, but Bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support. On August 21, 2000, the Supreme Court of California, in an opinion signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, unanimously held that [...] "substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the [...] agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily." [...] In reaction to the decision, significant changes in California law relating to the validity and <b>enforceability</b> of premarital agreements soon followed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and <b>enforceability</b> of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an actual loss or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that fees for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|E
2500|$|The {{validity}} of arbitration clauses in the US {{is not a}} settled legal matter. Typically, the {{validity of}} an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator. However, if {{the validity of the}} entire arbitration agreement is in dispute, then the Supreme Court of the United States case of Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson may apply. In that case, the court held that [...] "under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the <b>enforceability</b> of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the <b>enforceability</b> of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the <b>enforceability</b> of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator." [...] In other words, the law typically allows federal courts to decide these types of [...] "gateway" [...] or validity questions, but the Supreme Court ruled that since Jackson targeted the entire contract rather than a specific clause, the arbitrator decided the validity. Public Citizen, an advocacy organization opposed to the enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements, characterized the decision negatively: [...] "the court said that companies can write their contracts so that the companies' own arbitrator decides whether it's fair to submit a case to that arbitrator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus Emperor Theodosius II {{found that}} he had to balance the first two of the three factors {{governing}} the treatment of Jews in the empire—theology, political pragmatism and <b>enforceability.</b> He could not, however, effectively control the third. In 438, Theodosius had to reaffirm the prohibition on Jews holding public office, because it had been poorly enforced. Even in 527, a decree which renewed this prohibition began by observing that [...] "heedless of the laws' command [...] infiltrated public offices".|$|E

[...] These laws are derived from medieval English civil law, and relate to the authority to grant arms, and the regulation of their use, although the <b>enforceability</b> of these laws in Western Australia is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co. (388 U.S. 395 (1967)), is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that established {{what has become}} known as the [...] "separability principle" [...] in contracts with arbitration clauses. Following an appellate court ruling a decade earlier, it reads the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to require that any challenges to the <b>enforceability</b> of such a contract first be heard by an arbitrator, not a court, unless the claim is that the clause itself is unenforceable.|$|E

2500|$|EchoStar Corp. petitioned for a {{rehearing}} en banc by the Federal Circuit {{to challenge}} “the <b>enforceability</b> of the District Court's injunction based on overbreadth and vagueness.” Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit overruled the case which the KSM test was from, “we conclude that KSM's two-step inquiry has been unworkable and now overrule that holding of KSM.” The en banc Federal Circuit replaced the KSM test {{with a straight}} “more than colorable difference test.” As {{a result of the}} application of the new test, the en banc Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s finding of contempt for violating the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction. However, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding with regards to the Disablement Provision; thus, affirming the District Court’s finding of contempt. The en banc Federal Circuit found EchoStar Corp’s arguments for overbreath and vagueness in the permanent injunction “unpersuasive.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Mexican courts grant {{automatic}} {{custody of}} children below 7–12 years (depending on the state) to mothers {{unless they have}} been proven to be unfit. [...] This maternal preference {{has been the subject}} of Constitutional challenges on the basis that the Mexican Constitution enshrines the equality of the sexes, but has been upheld on the grounds that the Constitution also protects the integrity of the family. [...] Custody cases are also not immune to many of the problems found in Hague cases and, even if a custody decision were to be won it would not necessarily allow for the child to be taken back out of Mexico. [...] In cases where taking the child back out of Mexico to the home country is sought the decision can be subject to the same lack of <b>enforceability</b> pending the exhaustion of all appeals that plagues Hague Convention applications.|$|E
2500|$|While BMC's most {{significant}} asset {{is perhaps a}} workforce of skilled software engineers, the firm owns considerable intellectual property {{in the form of}} software code. It elaborated how it protects this property in an SEC filing (2002): [...] "We distribute our products in object code form and rely upon contract, trade secret, copyright and patent laws to protect our intellectual property. The license agreements under which customers use our products restrict the customer's use to its own operations and prohibit disclosure to third persons. We now distribute certain of our products on a shrink-wrap basis, and the <b>enforceability</b> of such restrictions in a shrink-wrap license is unproven in certain jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding those restrictions, it is possible for other persons to obtain copies of our products in object code form. We believe that obtaining such copies would have limited value without access to the product's source code, which we keep highly confidential. In addition, we employ protective measures such as CPU dependent passwords, expiring passwords and time-based trials." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{resolution}} of these restrictions came shortly after 1585, {{when a new}} Court of Exchequer Chamber was established to hear common law appeals. In 1602, in Slade v Morley, a grain merchant named Slade claimed that Morley had agreed to buy wheat and rye for £16, but then had backed out. Actions for debt were in {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court of Common Pleas, which had required both (1) proof of a debt, and (2) a subsequent promise to repay the debt, so that a finding of deceit (for non-payment) could be made against a defendant. But if a claimant wanted to simply demand payment of the contractual debt (rather than a subsequent promise to pay) he could have to risk a wager of law. The judges of the Court of the King's Bench was prepared to allow [...] "assumpsit" [...] actions (for obligations being assumed) simply from proof of the original agreement. With a majority in the Exchquer Chamber, after six years Lord Popham CJ held that [...] "every contract importeth in itself an Assumpsit". Around the same time the Common Pleas indicated a different limit for contract enforcement in Bret v JS, that [...] "natural affection of itself is not a sufficient consideration to ground an assumpsit" [...] and {{there had to be some}} [...] "express quid pro quo". Now that wager of law, and sealed covenants were essentially unnecessary, the Statute of Frauds 1677 codified the contract types that were thought should still require some form. Over the late 17th and 18th centuries Sir John Holt, and then Lord Mansfield actively incorporated the principles of international trade law and custom into English common law as they saw it: principles of commercial certainty, good faith, fair dealing, and the <b>enforceability</b> of seriously intended promises. As Lord Mansfield held, [...] "Mercantile law is not the law of a particular country but the law of all nations", and [...] "the law of merchants and the law of the land is the same".|$|E
2500|$|Disputes {{over the}} {{constitutional}} and statutory status of union shop and agency shop agreements began {{almost immediately after}} the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. In the Supreme Court's first major ruling on the issue in Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), the Court held that the union security provisions of the Railway Labor Act were constitutional, but withheld judgment as to [...] "the validity or <b>enforceability</b> of a union or closed shop agreement if other conditions of union membership are imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First or the Fifth Amendment." [...] The ruling in Hanson appeared to call into serious question the viability of union shop agreements. Five years later, in Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961), the Court held that the Railway Labor Act [...] "denies the authority to a union, over the employee's objection, to spend his money for political causes which he opposes." [...] The high court also confronted the issue of remedy in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen. [...] The Supreme Court returned to the union security issue three more times in 1963. [...] In NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that agency fees equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an agency fee set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue). The Court further elaborated on the issue of remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing agency fee payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples but refusing to allow them to act as a class. The Supreme Court extended its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and agency fee clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee agency fee mechanisms are also constitutional.|$|E
