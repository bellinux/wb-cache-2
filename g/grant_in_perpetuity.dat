500|$|Huntly {{brought in}} Sir Duncan Grant of Freuchie {{to restore order}} to the area around Urquhart Castle. His son John Grant of Freuchie (d.1538) was given a five-year lease of the Glen Urquhart estate in 1502. In 1509, Urquhart Castle, along with the estates of Glen Urquhart and Glenmoriston, was granted by James IV to John <b>Grant</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity,</b> on {{condition}} that he repair and rebuild the castle. [...] The Grants maintained their ownership of the castle until 1512, although the raids from the west continued. In 1513, following the disaster of Flodden, Sir Donald MacDonald of Lochalsh attempted to gain from the disarray in Scotland by claiming the Lordship of the Isles and occupying Urquhart Castle. Grant regained the castle before 1517, but not before the MacDonalds had driven off 300 cattle and 1,000 sheep, as well as looting the castle of provisions. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to claim damages from MacDonald. James Grant of Freuchie (d.1553) succeeded his father, and in 1544 became involved with Huntly and Clan Fraser in a feud with the Macdonalds of Clanranald, which culminated in the Battle of the Shirts. In retaliation, the MacDonalds and their allies the Camerons attacked and captured Urquhart in 1545. Known as the [...] "Great Raid", this time the MacDonalds succeeded in taking 2,000 cattle, as well as hundreds of other animals, and stripped the castle of its furniture, cannon, and even the gates. Grant regained the castle, and was also awarded Cameron lands as recompense.|$|E

I was stationed in that neighborhood.--To whom did it originally belong?--I believe, to the zemindary of Radshi, belonging to Ranny Bhowanny.--For what reason was it taken from the Ranny of Radshi and given to Cantoo Baboo?--I do not exactly recollect: I believe, on some plea of incapacity or insufficiency in her to manage it, or some pretended decline in the revenue, owing to mismanagement.--On what terms was it granted to Cantoo Baboo or his son?--I believe it was a <b>grant</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity,</b> at the revenue of Rupees 82,000 or 83,000 per annum.--What amount did he collect from the country?--I cannot tell. The year I was in that neighborhood, the settlement with his under-tenants was something above 3,53,000 rupees. The inhabitants of the country objected to it. They assembled in a body of about five thousand, and were proceeding to Calcutta to make known their grievances to the Committee of Revenue. They were stopped at Cossimbazar by Noor Sing Baboo, the brother of Cantoo Baboo, and there the matter was compromised,--in what manner I cannot say." ...|$|E

50|$|On rare occasions, {{intellectual}} property rights are <b>granted</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> When the current UK copyright law was debated in Parliament, former Prime Minister Lord Callaghan of Cardiff successfully proposed an amendment granting Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children a right to payments of royalties for performances, publications and broadcasts of Peter Pan <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity,</b> now enshrined <b>in</b> the Act.|$|R

5000|$|When the Spanish crown {{issued the}} New Laws that put {{restrictions}} on the grants of elite conquerors awarded grants of labor encomenderos, the viceroy prudently refrained from implementing the most draconian aspects of the edicts, which no longer permitted an encomendero family holding the <b>grant</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> In Peru, {{the implementation of the}} New Laws resulted in outright rebellion and the assassination of the viceroy.

This was its only practical distinction from [...] "folkland".|$|R
50|$|But, as in {{many other}} revolts, the Venetians were to have the last word.

25|$|Rand {{argued that}} limited {{intellectual}} property monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, {{the value of}} a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were <b>granted</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity,</b> it would necessarily lead to de facto collectivism.|$|R
50|$|There were bridges {{over one}} or two streams, the longest being 28 ft, but it crossed roadways on the level, {{at one point the}} main Wrexham to Chester road.

Heywood therefore campaigned for a clause in the proposed Light Railway Bill which would allow permission for public road crossings to be <b>granted</b> <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b>|$|R

50|$|Each reducción had {{a native}} chief {{responsible}} for {{keeping track of}} the laborers in his community.

These recommendations of the committee were adopted by the government and outstanding hereditary pensions were gradually commuted, the only ones left outstanding being those to Lord Rodney (£2,000) and to Lord Nelson (£5,000), both chargeable on the Consolidated Fund.|$|R
