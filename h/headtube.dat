5000|$|... {{oversized}} externally and internally butted <b>headtube</b> for conical 1.25" [...] fork ...|$|E
50|$|Ruptured spleen in January 1989 at the Magnolia {{jumps in}} Huntington Beach, California. <b>Headtube</b> broke {{off of a}} {{prototype}} ELF frame.|$|E
50|$|Cannondale {{has brought}} a few {{concepts}} to market that have since become accepted industry standards. Cannondale {{was the first to}} produce a crankset that uses externally mounted bottom bracket bearings, though they later discontinued this design. External bearings are now {{the most common type of}} bottom bracket for mid-level and higher bicycles. In 1992, Cannondale introduced the Headshok and the accompanying oversized headtube.In 2001, the OnePointFive standard emerged using similar <b>headtube</b> dimensions as the Headshok <b>headtube.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{consists}} of interchangeable structural spacers that extend the <b>headtubeâ€™s</b> height.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} designs, a sport-touring derailleur frame. These were built using lugged joinery, and painted custard-yellow with black <b>headtubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{original}} designs, a fixed gear frame with 135mm rear dropout spacing and less aggressive geometry, intended for road use vs. on the track. These were lugged, and painted custard-yellow with black <b>headtubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cyclocross (c 1980s) Manufactured by Alan, stamped [...] "Colnago" [...] name {{on bottom}} of <b>headtube.</b> Aluminum tubing screwed and glued to lugs. Sizing stamped in bottom bracket, no serial number on rear dropouts. Top tube ovalized for {{shouldering}} bike on transitions.|$|E
5000|$|Cannondale Headshok. Although a Headshok steerer {{is close}} to 1.5" [...] it is {{actually}} 1.5625" [...] or 1 9/16 inch (39.6875 mm). The <b>Headtube</b> dimensions for 1.5" [...] and Headshok are very similar, differing only in the minimum press depth.|$|E
5000|$|The Turner DHR was remodeled with 8.5" [...] of travel, 20mm {{dropouts}} on {{the rear}} with a 12mm axle, and a 1.5" [...] <b>headtube.</b> Gone were the [...] "classic" [...] twin toptube and rounded downtube, to be replaced with box section tubing.|$|E
50|$|Released {{to market}} in mid-2004, Kogswell's sport-touring {{frameset}} {{was made with}} upscale lugs and heat-treated tubing. Most were British racing green in color with white <b>headtubes.</b> The initial production run of 150 quickly sold out. Aaron's Bicycle Repair in Seattle (RideYourBike.com) had a run of blue done in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Cane Creek Standard: 36/45. Very {{common on}} {{mountain}} bike frames {{and a fair}} amount of road frames. Most frames made by Giant that have integrated <b>headtubes</b> use this standard (which amounts to a lot of bicycles). Two major manufacturers: FSA and Cane Creek. Head tubes with this standard have a 41.1mm inner diameter, and Cane Creek claims its CC Standard headsets will fit in a Campagnolo Standard head tube using a 0.25mm shim under the top cap of the headset.|$|R
2500|$|A Chinese {{drinking}} bird toy {{dating back}} to 1910s~1930s named insatiable birdie is described in Yakov Perelman's Physics for Entertainment. The book explained the [...] "insatiable" [...] mechanism: [...] "Since the <b>headtube's</b> temperature becomes {{lower than that of}} the tail reservoir, this causes a drop in the pressure of the saturated vapours in the head-tube ..." [...] It was said in Shanghai, China, that when Albert Einstein and his wife, Elsa, arrived in Shanghai in 1922, they were fascinated by the Chinese [...] "insatiable birdie" [...] toy.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as semi-integrated headsets, internal headsets include all of the parts of conventional threadless headsets, but locate the bearings inside the head tube, instead of outside. Unlike integrated headsets, internal headsets still employ cups between the bearings and the frame itself. Prominent standards in internal headsets include Chris King's InSet and Cane Creek's ZeroStack. These designs use a 44.0 mm internal <b>headtube</b> diameter.|$|E
50|$|The basic scooter design {{consists}} of an airplane grade aluminum frame, 98 mm polyurethane wheels, and a hinged fender over the rear wheel, which is pushed down by the foot {{to act as a}} spoon brake. The handlebar and <b>headtube</b> fold when a quick release latch is opened, allowing for easy carriage. This design made the scooters lighter and quieter than the previous models, increasing their popularity with both kids and parents.|$|E
50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The <b>headtube</b> may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the <b>headtube</b> using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the <b>headtube.</b> The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|E

Hillery got a patent in 1945. Arthur M. Hillery suggested the use of acetone as working fluid.This Chinese invention was again patented in the US by Miles V. Sullivan in 1946.He was a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA.|$|R
50|$|The headset is {{the set of}} {{components}} on a bicycle that provides a rotatable interface between the bicycle fork and the head tube of the bicycle frame. The tube through which the steerer of the fork passes is called the head tube. A typical headset consists of two cups that are pressed into {{the top and bottom}} of the <b>headtube.</b> Inside the two cups are bearings which provide a low friction contact between the bearing cup and the steerer.|$|E
5000|$|Delta Linear, U.S. patent 5,842,712 {{issued on}} 12/1/98. KHS {{developed}} its Delta Linear Downtube {{in order to}} decrease weight and to increase strength, rigidity and long term durability of its frames. The teardrop-shaped Delta Linear tube is drawn to a round shape at the bottom bracket {{in order to reduce}} flex under aggressive pedaling and ovalized on the vertical axis at the <b>headtube</b> in order to increase frame rigidity by over 30% over conventional round tubes.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{similarities}} {{with the}} bicycles used {{and often the}} riding locations, the divisions between downhill riding and freeriding are often overlooked. For example, freeride bikes have steeper head tube angles and shorter wheelbases for low-speed stability on technical stunts, while downhill bikes have slacker <b>headtube</b> angles and longer wheelbases for absolute high-speed stability {{at the cost of}} low-speed maneuverability. Downhill riding is primarily concerned with descending a slope on a given course as quickly as possible. There are often many obstacles in downhill riding, including jumps, drops, and rocky sections.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent development, integrated headsets {{do away with}} the upper and lower bearing cups on threadless headsets and instead seat the bearings directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek's [...] "IS" [...] and Campagnolo's standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King's argument is that headtubes with bearing [...] "seats" [...] are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the <b>headtube</b> of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.|$|E
