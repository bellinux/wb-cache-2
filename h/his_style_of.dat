5|$|Hunt drew {{criticism}} for <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> returning the football; upon receiving the ball, {{he would run}} straight at opposition players rather than attempting to evade them. As a result, he received several high tackles, causing the Broncos to ask the NRL to protect Hunt by punishing opposition players more severely. The referees' board supported this position, and stated that fullbacks such as Hunt needed to be protected due to greater risk of injury.|$|E

5|$|Despite winning four of {{the first}} five league matches of the 2014/15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino's {{position}} had become {{the subject of much}} speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to Huddersfield Town the day before.|$|E
5|$|Hansen {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2008–09, making the roster out {{training}} camp and establishing himself as a third-line forward. He became known as a player for his speed and work ethic, lending to his effectiveness in puck-pursuit and forechecking. Also responsible defensively, he began to be used consistently on the penalty kill. Hansen has recalled {{the transition to the}} NHL requiring a change in <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> play to incorporate more physicality and abrasiveness. Prior to making the NHL, he relied more on skill and finesse, having been a go-to offensive player for teams up to that point.|$|E

Manager Telê Santana turned to the Paulistas youth and instilled <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> quick, cheerful, and decisive football. Led by stars such as Zetti, Müller, Raí, Cafu, Palhinha, São Paulo beat Newell's Old Boys of Argentina to begin a dynasty. In 1993 São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals.

5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke.

5|$|Regenbald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward for}} his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop. He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> life was known to be unchaste.|$|E
5|$|Sven-Göran Eriksson {{took over}} from Pearce for the 2007–08 season and, {{following}} a spending spree, Samaras was reportedly deemed surplus to requirements {{by the new}} manager.

Samaras was linked with a £2.5million move to Middlesbrough {{towards the end of the}} transfer window but ended up staying at City. Eriksson stated that although he was unimpressed with Samaras when he first joined, he felt the player had improved and adapted <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> play a lot during pre-season and that he now felt comfortable keeping him at the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{period was}} also renowned for {{ceramics}} and porcelains.The major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province. The Dehua porcelain factories catered to European tastes by creating Chinese export porcelain by the 16th century. Individual potters also became known, such as He Chaozong, who became {{famous in the}} early 17th century for <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> white porcelain sculpture. In The Ceramic Trade in Asia, Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.|$|E

5|$|An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, {{he won the}} 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, {{finishing}} the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic {{gold medal at the}} 2008 Summer Olympics. <b>His</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation was {{that he did not want}} to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Howling Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. Howling Bells were impressed by <b>his</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions very natural. The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people, made the record that they wanted, and hoped that it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E
