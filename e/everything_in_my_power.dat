While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study {{of the use of}} chemicals in warfare, I do not want the Government of the United States to do anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|Kumaritashvili's death raised {{concerns}} about athlete safety at the Winter Olympics. As of 21 February 2010, there were 30 crashes in bobsleigh and luge at the Sliding Centre. Debate was raised on tightening qualification standards in weeding out unqualified athletes, in requiring {{a large number of}} training runs, in slowing down the sliding tracks, or in combining the three. The Russian National Sliding Centre planned for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events at the 2014 Winter Olympics has not been built though organizers already said that it is designed to be [...] slower than The Whistler Sliding Centre. Sochi's Sliding Centre will be monitored via 3-D computer graphics and simulation. The IOC has improved safety standards over the years such as lowering obstacles for the equestrian three-day event, requiring protective head gear for boxing and ice hockey, and tightening qualification standards to preclude athletes not qualified for the event. FIBT President Storey wanted to wait to review safety of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton until after the 2010 Games, stating that track designers needed to find a balance between challenges and dangers on the track. Track designer Gurgel told Sport Bild that perhaps track walls should be raised [...] on future courses though a risk-proof course may not be possible. According to VANOC, over 30,000 runs were made prior to the games with neither the FIBT nor the FIL issuing public danger warnings about the track. IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that he [...] "will do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> that this should not happen again in the future".|$|E

6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the chapter}} I gave an account of an {{interview}} I [...] had with a great landowner who happened to be a collector, and [...] who cried out that such a law as the one I suggested would be [...] an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject.

[...] "No," [...] he said warmly, [...] "I will not for a moment encourage you to hope [...] that any good will come of such a proposal.

6000|$|A year back Laura {{would have}} been indignant {{at the idea that}} Arthur should marry Blanche: and her high spirit would have risen, as she thought that from worldly motives he should stoop to one so unworthy. Now when the news was brought to her of such a chance (the {{intelligence}} was given to her by old Lady Rockminster, whose speeches were as direct and rapid as a slap on the face), the humbled girl winced a little at the blow, but bore it meekly, and with a desperate acquiescence. [...] "He has a right to marry, he knows a great deal more of the world than I do," [...] she argued with herself. [...] "Blanche may not be so light-minded as she seemed, and who am I to be her judge? I daresay it is very good that Arthur should go into Parliament and distinguish himself, and my duty is to do <b>everything</b> that lies <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to aid him and Blanche, and to make his home happy. I daresay I shall live with them. If I am godmother to one of their children, I will leave her my three thousand pounds!" [...] And forthwith she began to think what she could give Blanche out of her small treasures, and how best to conciliate her affection. She wrote her forthwith a kind letter, in which, of course, no mention was made of the plans in contemplation, but in which Laura recalled old times, and spoke her goodwill, and in reply to this she received an eager answer from Blanche: in which not a word about marriage was said, to be sure, but Mr. Pendennis was mentioned two or three times in the letter, and they were to be henceforth, dearest Laura, and dearest Blanche, and loving sisters, and so forth.|$|R

However, it was not the science of the doctors that led to his eventual recovery. Describing his walks on the Netherne grounds, he writes, [...] "I walked and walked, going round and round in the labyrinth of my mind just as that rat in my painting. If the doctors didn’t seem able or interested in untangling the snarl, then I, at least, should do and try <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> before giving up."

[...] Jones took out a full page ad in The Tennessean, promising [...] "he'll win back trust" [...] of his teammates and fans."

2500|$|Opponents of the bill, such as Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), were {{concerned}} that the measure took a step too far. Meeks said that [...] "I remain committed to doing <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to support a positive outcome in that nation. But I believe vehemently that unilateral action by the United States is not the answer." [...] Meeks also argued that the bill [...] "does not advance U.S. interests, it will not help the people of Venezuela and it sends the message to our regional allies that we don't care much about what they think." [...] Regional groups like UNASUR, the Caribbean Community, and the Organization of American States have all supported the government instead of the protestors. Fourteen House members {{wrote a letter to}} President Barack Obama about the bill in which they said [...] "as unilateral U.S. intervention and sanctions have caused deep resentment throughout Latin America, these are not the right tools for our regional policy in instances where they lack any significant regional backing." ...|$|E

[...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>power</b> to make sure that those raves continue… That is what I am going to do for Chris."
