40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>train</b> is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic transmissions, based on cams and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and the ring cam, which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in cam transmissions. The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate cams during transmission. A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>train</b> upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an <b>epicyclic</b> <b>train</b> than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the authors}} {{describe}} a modeling and design method {{for a permanent}} magnet drive used in a power train for Hybrid Electric Heavy Vehicle, based on a Series-Parallel architecture. The hybrid powertrain structure enables high requirements for boost mode of acceleration and full electric mode. A 'Ravigneaux' train was integrated in this hybrid powertrain structure in order to split energy among the vehicle wheels, the thermal engine, the electrical motor and the alternator. To compare the classical simple <b>epicyclic</b> <b>train</b> used in series-parallel Toyota hybrid structure, this 'Ravigneaux' train developed by Nexter group presents a better adaptation to high mechanical constraints (high power and torque) because of its double stages compound structure. Several operation modes of vehicle were analyzed by assuming that the two electrical machines were identical and reversible (they can both operate as a motor or an alternator). In this paper, a simple drive is considered: it deals with a Surface-Mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (SMPMSM) and a two level Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). An analytical modeling based on three working points: boost working point, nominal working point and maximal rotation speed working point has been elaborated. The analytical modeling {{makes it possible to}} model the physical behavior of different components. It enables to analyze quickly the relationship between the different parameters. A numerical modeling using 2 D finite elements is also presented in this paper. The aim of 2 D finite elements analysis (2 DFEA) is to validate the machine performances obtained by analytical modeling. It enables to model some physical phenomena with a better accuracy, such as magnetic saturation. Generally, the results given by 2 DFEA will be closer to experimental results. The control law of the electrical machine was investigated by the way of a single-phased electromechanical modeling. With this model, the flux weakening analysis has been taken into account in order to adapt the motor winding according to the rotation speeds defined in the specifications. The flux weakening was realized by considering mechanical and electrical characteristics linked with power, torque, rotation speed, DC-link voltage, feeding voltage of electrical machine, Id and Iq currents, cyclic inductance, winding resistance, back-electromotive force, phase difference between back electromotive force and phase current [...] . The electrical machine losses have been calculated by neglecting the mechanical losses and PM losses. The machine losses calculation includes the copper losses and the iron losses (eddy currents losses and hysteresis losses). The flux density in the stator yoke and the teeth was evaluated by taking into account the magnetic flux created by permanent magnet and the one created by armature reaction (stator current). The inverter losses were calculated too, by considering the commutation and conduction losses of both diodes and IGBT transistors. Thus, the total losses and the global efficiencies of motor and inverter were evaluated and the best working points can be deduced from those calculations. The previous models enable to evaluate global energy performances of electrical machines and inverters by respecting the constraints defined in the specifications. This methodology is general and can be a first step of a complete power train optimal design, including the electrical drive, the gear, the energy storage units and possibly the internal combustion engine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Introduced in {{this paper}} is an {{innovative}} drive for wheeled mobile robots, {{that is based on}} two identical, coaxial wheels, independently driven by two identical motors. The common axis is capable of rotating about a vertical axis. The drive, termed Dual-Wheel Transmission (DWT), is composed of two identical <b>epicyclic</b> gear <b>trains,</b> lying at two different levels and coupled by a common planet-carrier. The latter can turn freely with respect to the robot platform carrying the motors, the transmission having, as a stand-alone unit, three degrees of freedom and only two motors, which makes it underactuated. Upon coupling this drive with two other wheel units, which is the minimum required for static support, a robot with mobility of three is produced, the underactuation thereby disappearing. Finally, the dimensioning of the DWT is reported for robustness against manufacturing, actuation and sensing errors.

40|$|Bevel-gear-type robotic wrist {{mechanisms}} {{are commonly used}} in industry. The reasons for their popularity are that they are compact, light-weight, and relatively inexpensive. However, there are singularities in their workspace, which substantially degrade their manipulative performance. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop an atlas of three-degree-of-freedom bevel- gear-type wrist mechanisms, and through dimensional synthesis to improve their kinematic performance. The dissertation contains two major parts: the first is structural analysis and synthesis, the other is kinematic analysis and dimensional synthesis. To synthesize the kinematic structures of bevel-gear-type wrist mechanisms, the kinematic structures are separated from their functional considerations. All kinematic structures which satisfy the mobility condition are enumerated in an unbiased, systematic manner. Then the bevel-gear-type wrist {{mechanisms are}} identified by applying the functional requirements. Structural analysis shows that a three-degree-of-freedom wrist mechanism usually consists of a non-fractionated, two-degree-of-freedom <b>epicyclic</b> gear <b>train</b> jointed with the base link. Therefore, the structural synthesis can be simplified into a problem of examining the atlas of non-fractionated, two-degree-of-freedom <b>epicyclic</b> gear <b>train</b> jointed with the base link. Therefore, the structural synthesis can be simplified into a problem of examining the atlas of non- fractionated, two-degree-of-freedom <b>epicyclic</b> gear <b>trains.</b> The resulting bevel-gear-type wrist mechanisms has been categorized and evaluated. It is shown that three-degree-of-freedom, four- jointed wrist mechanisms are promising for further improving the kinematic performance. It is found that a spherical planetary gear train is necessarily embedded in a three-degree-of-freedom, four-jointed wrist mechanism. Therefore, to study the workspace and singularity problems of three-degree-of-freedom, four-jointed spherical wrist mechanisms, we have to study the trajectories of spherical planetary gear trains. The parametric equations of the trajectories and some useful geometric properties for the analysis and synthesis of workspace are derived. The workspace boundary equations can be derived via both geometric consideration and Jacobian analysis. The workspace is divided by inner and outer boundaries into regions of accessibility of zero, two and four. The design criteria of full workspace and a maximum four-root region are established.
