25|$|The 2015 Catalan {{regional}} election {{was held on}} Sunday, 27 September 2015, electing the 11th Parliament of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia. All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election. This was the third regional Catalan election in only five years, after the 2010 and 2012 elections {{and the first one}} in over 37 years in which <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> of Catalonia (CDC) and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) ran separately, after the dissolution of Convergence and Union (CiU) in June 2015 over disagreements on the coalition's separatist turn.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 six parties (VU, the Frisian National Party, Independent Fianna Fáil, the Party of German-speaking Belgians, the Party for the Organization of a Free Brittany and the Alsace-Lorraine National Association), plus three {{observers}} (the Union of the Corsican People, the Occitan Party and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> of Catalonia, CDC), {{joined forces}} to form the European Free Alliance. Regionalist MEPs continued, however, to sit in different groups in the European Parliament: the SNP in the Gaullist-dominated European Democratic Alliance; the VU, the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az) and Basque Solidarity (EA) in the Rainbow Group, together with Green parties; the SVP in the European People's Party group; the CDC with the Liberal Democrats; and Batasuna among Non-Inscrits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> of Catalonia (CDC), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Democrats of Catalonia (DC) and Left Movement (MES) agreed by mid-July 2015 to run {{together}} under the Junts pel Sí (Catalan for Together for Yes) joint separatist list, {{with support from the}} pro-independence Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Òmnium and the also separatist Municipalities' Association for Independence (AMI). Artur Mas was named as the agreed presidential candidate, even though, as a result of balance of power negotiations between ERC and CDC, he was placed 4th in the electoral ticket. Instead, the list was to be headed by three independent figures: Raül Romeva, former European MP for ICV who had left the party for not supporting independence; Carme Forcadell, former ANC president and Muriel Casals, Òmnium chairwoman. Oriol Junqueras would follow in 5th place.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} to Mauritania in 1984, Haidallah {{was held in}} administrative detention for several years by Ould Taya, during which time he fell sick. After his release, he stayed outside politics until 2003, {{when he returned to}} head the opposition. He then unsuccessfully ran for president against Taya in November, campaigning on a moderately Islamist platform, whereas Taya, who had established full diplomatic ties with Israel, was considered pro-Western. Haidallah officially came in second with about 19% of the vote, although he alleged fraud; he was arrested immediately after the election, accused of plotting a coup. Haidallah had also been briefly detained just prior to the vote. On December 28, 2003 he received a five-year suspended sentence and therefore was set free, but barred from politics for five years. An appeals court confirmed this sentence in April 2004. Also in April, his supporters attempted to register a political party, the Party for <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2000 the Haitian {{legislative}} election, 2000 for the Chamber of Deputies {{and two-thirds}} of the Senate took place. The election drew a voter turnout of more than 60%, and the FL won a virtual sweep. However, the elections were marred by controversy in the Senate race over the calculation of whether Senate candidates had achieved the majority required to avoid a run-off election (in Haiti, seats where no candidate wins an absolute majority of votes cast has to enter a second-round run-off election). The validity of the Electoral Council's post-ballot calculations of whether a majority had been attained was disputed. The Organization of American States complained about the calculation and declined to observe the July run-off elections. The opposition parties, regrouped in the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> (Convergence Démocratique, CD), demanded that the elections be annulled, and that Préval stand down and {{be replaced by a}} provisional government. In the meantime, the opposition announced it would boycott the November presidential and senatorial elections. Haiti's main aid donors threatened to cut off aid. At the November 2000 elections, boycotted by the opposition, Aristide was again elected president, with more than 90% of the vote, on a turnout of around 50% according to international observers. The opposition refused to accept the result or to recognize Aristide as president.|$|E
500|$|Events at the {{gathering}} have several times resulted in controversies, and clashes between rival political factions. Following the 1981 event, the Catalan parliament president Heribert Barrera, two parliamentary deputies, and several others, faced criminal charges of [...] "insulting the feelings and {{unity of the}} Spanish nation and distributing illegal publications". The charges were dropped after three years. The 1986 gathering was marred by the burning of Spanish flags and harassment of moderate groups. As a result, the mainstream political parties <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> and Republican Left {{stayed away from the}} 1987 event. In 1988, different factions of the far-left Movement for Defence of the Land (MDT) fought each other. In 1991, MDT militants attacked youth members of <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> and Republican Left, and in 1996, hooded left-wing militants came from their assembly at Pi Jove to attack members of Estat Català at Pi Vell. Since the events of 1996, the authorities have increased security at {{the gathering}}, and the event has returned to a peaceful cultural atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Aside from Bacalé, {{the other}} three {{withdrawn}} candidates were Secundino Oyono of the Social <b>Democratic</b> and Popular <b>Convergence</b> (CSDP), Jeremiah Ondo of the Popular Union (UP), and Buenaventura Mosuy of the Party of the Social Democratic Coalition. Severo Moto, an opposition leader in exile, {{said that there was}} no chance of a free and fair election.|$|R
50|$|The Coalition for the Good of All (Coalición por el Bien de Todos) was {{a left-wing}} {{coalition}} {{created by the}} Party of the <b>Democratic</b> Revolution (PRD), <b>Convergence</b> and the Labor Party (PT) to support Andrés Manuel López Obrador {{as a candidate for}} the presidency of Mexico in the general election of 2006. The coalition also presented joint candidates for Congressional and local elections.|$|R
50|$|Uribe was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Liberal Party—even {{participating}} in the Liberal Youth and the Liberal militants before his political career began—until 2002 election when he split from the party due to its support of peace talks with the FARC. In this election, Uribe {{had the support of}} the Conservative Party (which had supported him and not run its own candidate in 2002 as well). The parties Radical Change, Team Wings Colombia, Citizen <b>Convergence,</b> <b>Democratic</b> Colombia and Colombia Viva also supported Uribe.|$|R
2500|$|Based on this result, on 27 October 2017 the Parliament of Catalonia {{approved}} a resolution creating an independent Republic unilaterally, {{by a vote}} considered illegal by the lawyers of the Parliament of Catalonia for violating {{the decisions of the}} Constitutional Court of Spain. In the Parliament of Catalonia, parties explicitly supporting independence are Partit Demòcrata Europeu Català (Catalan European Democratic Party; PDeCAT), formerly named Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya (<b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> of Catalonia; CDC); Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia; ERC), and Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (Popular Unity Candidacy; CUP). The PDeCAT and ERC currently form the coalition Junts pel Sí (Together for [...] "Yes"). Parties opposed to any change in Catalonia's position are Ciutadans (Citizens) and the Catalan branch of the Partido Popular (People's Party). The Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya (Socialists' Party of Catalonia; PSC), the Catalan referent of the Partido Socialista Obrero Español (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party; PSOE), officially favours a federalist option, although some of its members support self-determination. Podemos, the third largest party in the Spanish parliament, supports a referendum. Some other minor parties favour an intermediate form of self-determination, or at least support a referendum on the question.|$|E
2500|$|Tension within {{both parties}} forming the CiU {{federation}} had reached {{an all-time high}} in June 2015 due to differences between the positions the Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) leadership and <b>Democratic</b> <b>Convergence</b> of Catalonia (CDC) leader Artur Mas took over the sovereignty process. CDC was in favour of outright independence {{even if it meant}} breaking the established Spanish legality, while UDC was against doing it without a successful negotiation with the Spanish Government. As a result, a vote was held on 14 June 2015 between UDC members, asking whether the party should commit itself to continue with the process but establishing several conditions—including not violating the legality in force through unilateral independence declarations—or starting the constituent processes at the margin of legal norms. The first option, supported by UDC leaders and contrary to the signed agreements between CDC, ERC and sovereignty entities, was approved by UDC members with a narrow 50.9% to 46.1% choosing to stand at the side of CDC. After this, CDC issued an ultimatum to UDC for the latter to decide within [...] "two or three days" [...] whether it committed itself to the independence plan. On 17 June, after a meeting of the UDC leadership, it was announced that the party was withdrawing all three of its members from the Government of the Generalitat of Catalonia, although they agreed to maintain parliamentary stability {{until the end of the}} legislature. That same day at night, the CDC National Executive Committee met and in a press conference the next day confirmed that UDC and CDC would not stand together in the 2015 regional election, and that the political project of the CiU federation was over, spelling the end of 37 years of cooperation between both parties as Convergence and Union, a coalition which had dominated Catalan politics since the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} analyses {{the interaction}} between economic reforms, democratic reforms, and economic growth. One of the salient characteristics of the transition region has been two very distinct patterns between economic and <b>democratic</b> reforms: <b>convergence</b> of the two reform dimensions in the CEE countries and divergence in Eurasia. Nevertheless, results from econometric tests (which attempt to control for possible intervening influences) suggest that economic and democratic reforms are mutually reinforcing throughout the region, even in Eurasia. We also found evidence that: (1) economic reforms have a stronger impact on democratic reforms than the reverse; (2) economic reforms favorably affect economic growth; (3) democratic reforms favorably affect economic growth indirectly (via economic reforms) if not directly; and (4) while the feedback effects from economic growth to reforms are more ambiguous, {{there is some evidence}} that economic growth may actually stifle democratic reforms, and/or economic contraction may facilitate democratization. 2 USAID/E&E/PO Working Paper Series on the Transition Countrie...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{a special}} issue of the {{academic}} journal Cultural Studies was dedicated to the critical discussion of Jenkins’ notion of convergence culture. Titled ‘Rethinking “Convergence/Culture,” the volume was edited by James Hay and Nick Couldry. Hay and Couldry identify {{some of the key}} scholarly critiques of Jenkins’ work on convergence culture. They are: an excessive emphasis on the participatory potential of users; an under-appreciation of the inherently corporate logic of convergence; an insufficient consideration of the broader media landscape, with its corresponding power dynamics, in which the user engages with convergence; and an overly optimistic view of the <b>democratic</b> contribution of <b>convergence.</b>|$|R
