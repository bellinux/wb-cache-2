30|$|The NFP {{computation}} time (Fig.  9 b) for 1000 nodes and heavy requests is 920 ms {{at an average}} and is only {{a function of the}} size of the path and the <b>function</b> <b>sequence.</b> Since the path size is constrained to 1000 in the worst case and the <b>function</b> <b>sequence</b> to 15, this result is pretty reasonable to characterize real-world situations. The feasibility delay (Fig.  9 c) of 2600 ms for 1000 nodes and heavy requests is actually more than the NFP computation delay which suggests that, either better NFP solutions can be considered until the feasibility delay becomes less than the NFP computation delay, or the backoff delay and the limit for denial delay can be reduced. The migration delay (Fig.  9 d) for 1000 nodes and heavy requests is 1463 ms though real-world values of migration delays will give a better view on this particular factor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConsider a rooted tree {{structure}} the nodes {{of which have}} been labelled monotonically by elements of { 1, 2, [...] ,k}, which means that any sequence connecting the root of the tree with a leaf is weakly monotone. For fixed k asymptotic equivalents of the form Ckqk−n n 32 (n→∞) to the numbers of such {{tree structure}}s with n nodes are obtained for the family of extended unary-binary trees (i. e., Motzkin trees) and for the family of extended unary-t-ary trees. Furthermore the numbers of (not extended) monotonically labelled binary and unary-binary trees are studied. For each of these families the asymptotic behaviour of qk as k → ∞ is determined. This is done by investigating a non-linear <b>function</b> <b>sequence.</b> The roots of the functions of this <b>function</b> <b>sequence</b> equal qk. Thus one finds for instance qk ∼ (log 2) /k (k → ∞) for the family of extended unary-binary trees, and qk ∼ π 2 k (k → ∞) for the family of binary trees...|$|E
