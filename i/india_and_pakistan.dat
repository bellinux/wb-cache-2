5|$|During the 1930 s, {{reform was}} {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in the}} resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan.</b>|$|E

The ship breaking industry began in earnest in 1974 when Karnafully Metal Works started scrapping Al Abbas, a Pakistani ship damaged in 1971, and flourished in the 1980s.

5|$|England {{hosted the}} first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the {{resources}} required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day. The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan,</b> the first hosted outside England.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume did {{not play}} in the next Test match—he was {{replaced}} by John Goddard {{who came into the}} team as part of a pre-arranged scheme to rotate the captaincy.

He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but played no further representative cricket until 1957.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, the UN had {{peacekeeping}} soldiers deployed on 15 missions.

5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, <b>India,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan.</b> Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are otherwise known mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan</b> jointly {{hosted the}} 1987 tournament, {{the first time}} that the {{competition}} was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.|$|E

5|$|Indraloris is {{a fossil}} primate from the Miocene of <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan</b> {{in the family}} Sivaladapidae. Two species are now recognized: I.himalayensis from Haritalyangar, India (about 9 million years old) and I.kamlialensis from the Pothohar Plateau, Pakistan (15.2 million years old). Other {{material}} from the Potwar Plateau (16.8 and 15.2 million years old) may represent an additional, unnamed species. Body mass estimates range from about 2kg (4.4lb) for the smaller I.kamlialensis to over 4kg (8.8lb) for the larger I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|The next day, several {{countries}} suggested a resolution condemning the intervention {{and calling for}} immediate withdrawal. Eventually, a vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion; Algeria, <b>India,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan</b> abstained; the USSR (with veto power) and Hungary opposed. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward {{the release of the}} imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.|$|E

5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan.</b> At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it was not prepared to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E

5|$|Siddiqui is {{credited}} for pioneering {{the isolation of}} unique chemical compounds from the Neem (Azadirachta indica), Rauwolfia, and various other flora. As the founder director of H.E.J.

During his career, Siddiqui published more than 300 research papers and obtained 40 patents mainly {{from the field of}} natural product chemistry. In addition to his scientific talents, Siddiqui was also an avid painter, a poet, and a great connoisseur of Western music. His paintings were exhibited in the United States, Germany, <b>India,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan.</b>|$|E

A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.|$|E
5|$|The three {{orangutan}} {{species are}} the only extant members of the subfamily Ponginae. This subfamily also included the extinct genera Lufengpithecus, which lived in southern China and Thailand 2–8mya, and Sivapithecus, which lived <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan</b> from 12.5mya until 8.5mya. These apes likely lived in drier and cooler environments than orangutans do today. Khoratpithecus piriyai, which lived in Thailand 5–7mya, {{is believed to have}} been the closest known relative of the orangutans. The largest known primate, Gigantopithecus, was also a member of Ponginae and lived in China, India and Vietnam from 5mya to 100,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1971, {{there were}} rising {{tensions}} between <b>India</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pakistan,</b> and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s {{in the vicinity of}} Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to be useful for gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began.|$|E
