Although these may in themselves be produced digitally they comprise a traditional (physical) matrix. A <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> however is {{a repository of}} material which, stored digitally, is combined by the artist’s hand and instanced with original intent; Philip George’s “fluid diary” providing an early example. Technically the <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> comprises stable digital storage mechanisms (which retain the data when switched off) rather than volatile random access memory.

40|$|Hybrid {{precoding}} {{can significantly}} {{reduce the number of}} required radio frequency (RF) chains and relieve the huge energy consumption in mmWave massive MIMO systems, thus attracting much interests from academic and industry. However, most existing hybrid precoding schemes are based on singular value decomposition (SVD). Due to the very different sub-channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) after SVD, complicated bit allocations is usually required to match the sub-channel SNRs. To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean decomposition (GMD) -based hybrid precoding scheme to avoid the complicated bit allocation. Its basic idea is to seek a pair of analog and <b>digital</b> precoding <b>matrices</b> that are sufficiently close to the optimal unconstrained GMD precoding matrix. Specifically, we design the analog (<b>digital)</b> precoding <b>matrix</b> while keeping the <b>digital</b> (analog) precoding <b>matrix</b> fixed. Further, the principle of basis pursuit is utilized in the design of analog precoding matrix, while we obtain the <b>digital</b> precoding <b>matrix</b> by projecting the GMD operation on the <b>digital</b> precoding <b>matrix.</b> Simulation results verify that the proposed GMD-based hybird precoding scheme outperforms conventional SVD-based hybrid precoding schemes and achieves much better bit error rate (BER) performance with low complexity.

50|$|In {{her first}} poetry {{collection}} Geudeuli jigureul jibaehaeteul ttae (그들이 지구를 지배했을 때 When They Ruled the Earth), Yi Won often uses {{the image of}} electronic technology, a product of digital civilization. Those images become a device to criticize the atmosphere of today’s age. In her poetry, life is where people are controlled by a <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> and value. Yi Won describes the familiar but unfamiliar world within the digital system as ‘the electronic desert’. Her poetry showed the despair and sadness of lonely, desolate and forlorn individuals thrown in the barren ‘desert’. This type of critical mindset continues in her second poetry collection Yahoo!ui gangmul-e cheongae-ui dali tteunda (야후!의 강물에 천개의 달이 뜬다 A Thousands Moons Rising Over the River of Yahoo!). Among the Korean literary world of the 1990s, {{where there was a}} lot of monologue type poetry that withdrew into the inner side, Yi Won was the just about the only poet who wrote with the digital civilization in mind. Though, it is hard to consider that her works simply jumped on the development of IT technology. Her interest was in the problem of what type of existence people should lead in the age where digital civilization suddenly rose. Technological advancements offered people conveniences, but it also gave people the feeling that they were beings that drifted across the Internet, similar to data, unable to anchor onto their physical selves. Yi Won acutely captured what sensations are felt by people that have become cyborgs within such a modern society, and how they feel their physical bodies. On the other hand, in Sesang-eseo gajang gabyeo-un otobai (세상에서 가장 가벼운 오토바이 The World’s Lightest Motorcycle), and Bulganeunghan jongi-ui yeoksa (불가능한 종이의 역사 The History of the Impossible Paper), she doesn’t not directly reveal her interest on digital civilization. Instead, the poet faces the underlying loneliness of human beings, and attempts to find the meaning of existence from scars and absence.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a mixed-mode ASIC {{composed of a}} fast readout architecture that interfaces with a matrix of 4096 Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) was fabricated via STM 130 nm CMOS technology. Groups of 4 x 4 pixels form a macro-pixel (MP). The readout architecture is parallel and could overcome the readout speed limit of big matrices. As the output port can only accept one-hit information at a time, an internal queuing system has been provided to face high hit-rate conditions. The ASIC can work in two different manners {{as it can be}} connected to an actual full-custom matrix of MAPS or to a <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> emulator composed of standard cells, for testing facilities.

Sequential samples for the blood clearance of (99 m) Tc-HIDA or (99 m) Tc-PI {{were obtained}} for 120 min following injection to the patient of constitutional hyperbilirubinemia and ICG excretory defect disease. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the hepatic uptake of (99 m) Tc-HIDA was faster or normal but the excretion was extremely slower than in normal cases. Both hepatic uptake and excretion of (99 m) Tc-PI were almost normal. In Rotor's disease, hepatic uptake of (99 m) Tc-HIDA or (99 m) Tc-PI was very poor, showing almost no hepatic images in all time. In Gilbert's disease and ICG excretory defect disease, hepatic uptake and excretion of (99 m) Tc-HIDA or (99 m) Tc-PI were within normal limit. From these results, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor's disease and Gilbert's disease show the different patterns between hepatic uptake and excretion of (99 m) Tc-HIDA and (99 m) Tc-PI hepatobiliary scintigraphy and these patterns contribute to the differential diagnosis of constitutional jaundice.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} gated single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) myocardial perfusion images for determination of left ventricular ejection fraction. Background. Gated SPECT has expanded the applications of myocardial perfusion imaging to include the evaluation of left ventricular size, regional wall motion and regional systolic thickening. Accurate automated or semi-automated methods for quantitation of left ventricular ejection fraction from tomographic perfusion images would provide additional valuable clinical information. Methods. Rest gated SPECT {{was performed on the}} stress distribution of technetium- 99 m sestamibi, using eight frames per cardiac cycle. Mid-horizontal long-axis and vertical long-axis gated tomographic perfusion images were analyzed after <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> inversion, which enhances edge detection, for ejection fraction determination. These ejection fractions were compared with those determined by contrast ventriculography (n = 54, including 45 biplane and 9 single plane) and first-pass radionuclide angiography (n = 38) in patients with coronary artery disease. Results. Myocardial perfusion SPECT image inversion-derived ejection fractions were slightly lower (2. 7 ejection fraction units, p < 0. 01), and first-pass ejection fractions were much lower (8. 0 ejection fraction units, p < 0. 001) than those obtained with contrast ventriculography. There was excellent correlation between SPECT and contrast ventriculographic ejection fractions (r = 0. 93) over a wide range of ejection fractions (14 % to 89 %). Good correlation was also observed between first-pass radionuclide angiography and both contrast ventriculography (r = 0. 83) and SPECT (r = 0. 87). Reproducibility of SPECT image inversion ejection fractions was excellent (intraobserver r = 0. 99, interobserver r = 0. 93). Conclusions. Semiautomated ejection fractions can be obtained from gated SPECT technetium- 99 m sestamibi perfusion images using the image inversion technique. These results are reproducible and correlate well with results of first-pass radionuclide angiography but are closer in value to those obtained with contrast ventriculography...|$|E

In order to use collected information and existing knowledge of the observed object in {{the most efficient way}} for the purpose of solving specific problems, we have to examine their characteristics and if possible fuse them. This article is motivated by the existence of two operative digital sensor systems in Croatia that collect information at different wavelengths and with different methods of taking images. The first sensor is the <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> (staring) camera, for three visible channels (V: 0. 4 – 0. 5 µm, 0. 5 - 0. 6 µm, 0. 6 - 0. 7 µm), for near infrared channel (NIR: 0. 7 - 1. 0 µm) and the second sensor is the longwave thermal infrared (TIR: 8 - 14 µm) parallel scan camera. This paper will analyze the possibility of fusing information provided by above sensors, of one not very accessible area (mountainous terrain, with large differences of heights). Digital sensor systems yield multispectral images with different spatial and radiometric resolutions, geodetic and photogrammetric data (geographic maps, GPS data, ortophoto maps, geocoded mosaics), the insight in the field situation (ground truth) and other accessible sources provide inputs for fusion.

The second experiment was a replication of the first one except {{that some of the}} Arabic characters that were hard to be identified by the subjects in the first experiment were modified for the second one. Recognition speed, correct response, and preference ranking were dependent variables in both experiments. The independent variables were matrix pixel density, pixel shape, and pixel color. The levels of the matrix pixel density were 5 × 7, 7 × 9, 8 × 8, 9 × 14, 16 × 16, and 32 × 32 resolutions. Square and circular pixels were pixel shape. The pixel colors were red and green. Twenty-four treatment combinations were randomly presented to all subjects, where within subject design was employed to analyze the collected data. In these experiments, fifteen and six subjects exposed to 100 slides of Arabic letters presented on video display terminal for each matrix format. The results indicated that readability was improved significantly with increasing matrix pixel density. The results revealed that Arabic letters were more readable in square matrices (e. g., 8 × 8) rather than rectangular matrices (e. g., 7 × 9) in terms of correct responses and performance subjective rating. In addition, readability was significantly improved with square pixel shape. The subjects rated green pixels as more comfortable than the red ones.

40|$|The {{technological}} progress in digitalization of complete histological glass slides {{has opened a}} new door in tissue [...] based diagnosis. The presentation of microscopic images as a whole in a <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> is called virtual slide. A virtual slide allows calculation and related presentation of image information that otherwise can only be seen by individual human performance. The digital world permits attachments of several (if not all) fields of view and the contemporary visualization on a screen. The presentation of all microscopic magnifications is possible if the basic pixel resolution is less than 0. 25 microns. To introduce digital tissue [...] based diagnosis into the daily routine work of a surgical pathologist requires a new setup of workflow arrangement and procedures. The quality of digitized images is sufficient for diagnostic purposes; however, the time needed for viewing virtual slides exceeds that of viewing original glass slides by far. The reason lies in a slower and more difficult sampling procedure, which is the selection of information containing fields of view. By application of artificial intelligence, tissue [...] based diagnosis in routine work can be managed automatically in steps as follows: 1. The individual image quality has to be measured, and corrected, if necessary. 2. A diagnostic algorithm has to be applied. An algorithm has be developed, that includes both object based (object features, structures) and pixel based (texture) measures. 3. These measures serve for diagnosis classification and feedback to order additional information, for example in virtual immunohistochemical slides. 4. The measures can serve for automated image classification and detection of relevant image information by themselves without any labeling. 5. The pathologists' duty will not be released by such a system; to the contrary, it will manage and supervise the system, i. e., just working at a "higher level".

40|$|Penta cameras {{consisting}} of a nadir and four inclined cameras {{are becoming more and}} more popular, having the advantage of imaging also facades in built up areas from four directions. Such system cameras require a boresight calibration of the geometric relation of the cameras to each other, but also a calibration of the sub-cameras. Based on data sets of the ISPRS/EuroSDR benchmark for multi platform photogrammetry the inner orientation of the used IGI Penta DigiCAM has been analyzed. The required image coordinates of the blocks Dortmund and Zeche Zollern have been determined by Pix 4 Dmapper and have been independently adjusted and analyzed by program system BLUH. With 4. 1 million image points in 314 images respectively 3. 9 million image points in 248 images a dense matching was provided by Pix 4 Dmapper. With up to 19 respectively 29 images per object point the images are well connected, nevertheless the high number of images per object point are concentrated to the block centres while the inclined images outside the block centre are satisfying but not very strongly connected. This leads to very high values for the Student test (T-test) of the finally used additional parameters or in other words, additional parameters are highly significant. The estimated radial symmetric distortion of the nadir sub-camera corresponds to the laboratory calibration of IGI, but there are still radial symmetric distortions also for the inclined cameras with a size exceeding 5 μm even if mentioned as negligible based on the laboratory calibration. Radial and tangential effects of the image corners are limited but still available. Remarkable angular affine systematic image errors can be seen especially in the block Zeche Zollern. Such deformations are unusual for <b>digital</b> <b>matrix</b> cameras, but it can be caused by the correlation between inner and exterior orientation if only parallel flight lines are used. With exception of the angular affinity the systematic image errors for corresponding cameras of both blocks have the same trend, but as usual for block adjustments with self calibration, they still show significant differences. Based on the very high number of image points the remaining image residuals can be safely determined by overlaying and averaging the image residuals corresponding to their image coordinates. The size of the systematic image errors, not covered by the used additional parameters, is in the range of a square mean of 0. 1 pixels corresponding to 0. 6 μm. They are not the same for both blocks, but show some similarities for corresponding cameras. In general the bundle block adjustment with a satisfying set of additional parameters, checked by remaining systematic errors, is required for use of the whole geometric potential of the penta camera. Especially for object points on facades, often only in two images and taken with a limited base length, the correct handling of systematic image errors is important. At least in the analyzed data sets the self calibration of sub-cameras by bundle block adjustment suffers from the correlation of the inner to the exterior calibration due to missing crossing flight directions. As usual, the systematic image errors differ from block to block even without the influence of the correlation to the exterior orientation...|$|E
