40|$|Abstract. The {{solid phase}} microextraction (SPME) uses a <b>fine</b> <b>fused</b> silica fiber {{coated with a}} thin layer to extract {{directly}} analytes from samples. The silanol group at silica surface, Si-OH, can be acidic, and may exsit as an Si-O group at certain pH level, and silica backbone may have cation exchange secondary interactions, attracting cationic or basic analytes of interest. It is necessary that pH optimum for water sample should be adjusted. A 7 µm nonpolar polydimethylsiloxane coating was used to extract polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in environmental water such as river water, rainwater, ground water, tap water and accumulated water on farm. The influence of pH on extraction of PAHs in water was investigated, and the optimum pH 6 was affirmed. A GC/MS was used to detect PAHs with the selective ion-monitoring mode. The optimum thermally desorption time of PAHs from the fiber coating was 5 minutes. The precision and the recoveries were ranged from 4 to 13 % RSD and 71 to 114 %, respectively, depending on PAHs species. The trace levels of PAHs in environmental water were detected between 0. 4 ~ 15. 4 ng/ml...|$|R
40|$|To {{generate}} a seamless mosaic of a forward-looking sonar (FLS) video sequence, this study proposes a novel fusion method for FLS image mosaic, which includes two main steps from coarse to fine. In the coarse fusion step, the source images are first decomposed into multi-scale sub-bands using the non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT), then the sub-bands {{of the source}} images are merged, based on the Gabor energy and the local contrast for low and high frequency sub-bands, respectively, to generate the fused sub-bands which are used to produce the fused image by inverse NSCT. In the fine fusion step, a decision map is used to choose the pixels of the <b>fine</b> <b>fused</b> image from the coarsely fused image {{or one of the}} source images. This decision map is first constructed by measuring the similarity of the coarsely fused image to the source images, and then processed by a morphological post-processing technique to ensure its continuity and smoothness. Extensive experiments on FLS image fusion and mosaic have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed technique using both a subjective evaluation and objective metric...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to lack of}} "real" lunar soil or even lunar simulant, it is {{difficult}} to characterize the interaction between lunar soil (or simulant) with different surfaces that are involved in excavation and processing machinery. One unique feature possessed by lunar soil is the agglutinates produced by repeated high-speed micrometeoroid impacts and subsequent pulverization[l and 2]. The large particles are impacted by micrometeoroids [Fig. l] and pulverized to produce finer particles. This process continues until there are no more "large" particles left {{on the surface of the}} moon.

40|$|SUMMARY: The fine {{filaments}} of Bacillus megaterium {{are shown}} to arise from large basal cells: they have paired nuclear bodies within walls differing in composition {{from those of}} the normal vegetative cells. No evidence was found for any sexual fusion of these filaments. Young cultures of Bacillus megaterium often contain filamentous forms, especially when grown on blood-containing media. These differ from the vegetative cells typical of the growth cycle described by the author (Bergersen, 1953). DeLamater (1951), and DeLamater & Hunter (1953), described fusion tubes by means of which a diploid phase was instituted in B. megaterium. These tubes were <b>fine</b> filaments which <b>fused</b> with large haploid cells and were supposed to transfer nuclear material from one cell to another. Bisset (1953) criticized this work and stated that the filaments involved were septate, and it was therefore difficult to understand how they could function as fusion tubes. The present work was undertaken as a study of the fine filaments, with par-ticular reference to their cytology and behaviour in living cultures...|$|R

5000|$|Using both {{free verse}} and formal {{constraint}} to shape and sharpen his examinations of historical and personal events, Tillinghast is often {{concerned with the}} elusive nature of home. Poet Floyd Skloot, reviewing The Stonecutter’s Hand (1995) for the Harvard Review, observed that in those poems, “the urgency—the impulse to go—rises from a need to strip the self down to its essence, to relocate intimacy {{and a sense of}} community by immersing himself in remoteness.” Louis Simpson wrote, [...] "Tillinghast's poems range confidently among different cultures. He has a sense of history as a living force. The experiments in metre, rhyme and free verse in The Stonecutter's Hand are important. He is a wonderfully gifted poet, one of the few." [...] And the late Anthony Hecht commented: [...] "Of all the many complex, sometimes self-cancelling, tasks a poet must address, {{it may be that the}} most demanding and severe is getting things right. Richard Tillinghast performs that office with an honesty so strict that over and over his poems prove themselves faithful in ways that bring a quiet, undisputed delight." [...] In his introduction to Tillinghast's Selected Poems, Dennis O'Driscoll wrote, [...] "More outward-looking and international-minded than most contemporary American poets, Tillinghast nonetheless registers his country's history on his pulse[...] [...] [...] In sinewy lines and solid stanzas—fruits of a lifetime's devotion to the craft—Tillinghast's most recent poems, undoubtedly his <b>finest</b> to date, <b>fuse</b> a sobering sense of mortality with the exhilaration of renewal, indeed rejuvenation, through love." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStereoscopic depth {{perception}} may {{be obtained}} from small retinal disparities that can be fused for single vision (fine stereopsis), but reliable depth information is also obtained from larger disparities that produce double vision (coarse stereopsis). While {{there is some evidence}} that stereoacuity improves with age, little is known about the development and maturation of coarse stereopsis. Here we address this gap by assessing the maturation of stereoscopic depth perception in children (4 – 14 years) and adults over a large range of disparities from <b>fused</b> (<b>fine)</b> to diplopic (coarse). The observer’s task was to indicate whether a stereoscopic cartoon character was nearer or farther away than a zero-disparity reference frame. The test disparities were grouped into fine (0. 02, 0. 08, 0. 17, 0. 33, 0. 68, 1. 0 deg) and coarse (2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 deg) ranges based on an initial determination of the diplopia threshold for each observer. Next, percent correct depth direction was determined as a function of disparity. In the coarse range, accuracy decreased slightly with disparity and there were no differences as a function of age. In the fine range, accuracy was constant across all disparities in adults and increased with disparity in children of all ages. Performance was immature in all children at the finest disparity tested. We conclude that stereopsis in the coarse range is mature at 4 years of age, but stereopsis in the fine range, at least for small disparities, continues to mature into the school-age years...|$|R
40|$|For {{high power}} IC chips, as device size inevitably decreases, the wire {{diameter}} unfortunately must decrease {{due to the}} need of <b>finer</b> pitch wires. <b>Fusing</b> or melting of wirebonds thus increasingly becomes one of the potential failure issues for such IC’s. Experiments were performed under transient loads on dummy packages having aluminum, gold, or copper wires of different dimensions. A finite element model was constructed that correlates very well with the observed maximum operating currents for such wirebonds under actual experimental test conditions. A qualitative observation of typical current profiles, as fusing conditions were approached, was that current would reach a maximum value {{very early in the}} pulse, and then fall gradually. One goal achieved through the modeling was to show that the current in the wire falls with time due to the heating of the wire material. Correspondingly, the wire reaches the melting temperature not at the peak current but rather at the end of pulse. Further, modeling shows that knowledge of external resistance and inductance of the experimental set up are highly significant in determining the details of a fusing event, but if known along with the temperaturedependent wire properties, the simulation can predict the correct voltage and current response of the part with 2 % error. On the other hand, lack of external circuit characteristics may lead to completely incorrect results. For instance, the assumption that current is constant until the wire heats to fusing temperature, or that current and temperature both rise monotonically to maximum values until the wire fuses, are almost certain to be wrong. The work has been carried out for single pulse events as well as pulse trains. Key words: Bond wire fusing, wire melting, fusing current I...|$|R
40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is an {{additive}} manufacturing {{process for the}} direct fabrication prototypes, tools and functional parts. The process uses a high intensity laser beam to selectively <b>fuse</b> <b>fine</b> metal powder particles together in a layer-wise manner by scanning cross-sections generated from a three-dimensional CAD model. The SLM process is capable of producing near fully dense functional products, tools and prototypes without almost any geometrical limitation and having mechanical properties comparable to those produced by conventional manufacturing techniques. There is {{a wide range of}} materials that are suitable to be processed by SLM including various steels, Ti, Al and CoCr alloys. Being one of these materials, maraging steel 300 is an iron-nickel steel alloy which is often used in applications where high fracture toughness and strength are required or where dimensional changes have to remain at a minimal level, e. g. aircraft and aerospace industries for rocket motor castings and landing gear. To achieve its superior strength and hardness, maraging steel, of which the name is derived from ‘martensite aging’, should be treated with aging heat treatment. In this study, the effect of the SLM parameters (scan speed, layer thickness, etc.) on the obtained density, surface quality and hardness of maraging steel 300 parts is investigated. Moreover, various aging heat treatments (different combinations of duration at maximum temperature and the maximum temperature) are applied on the SLM parts to achieve the high hardness values. The mechanical testing of maraging steel 300 specimens produced by SLM and treated with an appropriate aging is accomplished by impact toughness and tensile and compared to the results obtained using conventional production techniques. Additionally, the microstructures of as-built and heat treated parts are investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was done in order to design a pressurized test facility for droplet analysis with a laser measurement technique, Phase Doppler Anemometry. The test facility was a development work within Chemrec's pressurized black liquor gasification (BLG) project. BLG is a complex process where black liquor is atomized and sprayed into a reactor and gasified using pure oxygen. In the process {{it is crucial that}} all organic material is consumed to produce combustible gases using three stages of conversion: drying, pyrolysis and char gasification. In the end of the conversion, only an inorganic smelt is supposed to remain (ideally). For the gasification process, {{it is important to be}} fully aware of the spray characteristics created by the nozzle that yields an ideal conversion. Therefore a pressurized spray test facility with optical access windows for measurements was developed. Parameters that are important and interesting to study are droplet size and their velocity. The purpose of the facility is to gain quantitative information to optimize the black liquor gasification (BLG) process. For measuring droplets, a non-intrusive laser measurements system is used called Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). PDA is the most advantageous technique for measuring droplet velocity and size distribution. The first stage in the work of developing this spray test facility was a brief feasibility study of other pressurized spray testing facilities using PDA, to get information of different concepts. Concepts and configurations of the different parts for the pressurized test facility have been analyzed and investigated with a variety of engineering tools. Because measurements with PDA are very depending on certain receiving angles a deep review of PDA was performed, all to achieve correct placement of the transmitting and receiving optical access windows. The final design resulted in a standing pressure vessel with height 5600 mm and a diameter of 500 mm. The test facility was tested and is approved for a working pressure of 15 bar. To prevent corrosion due to the future application of black liquor atomization, it was made of stainless steel (SS 2343). Four optical access side ports were placed approximately 500 mm from the top of the vessel. The side port for the transmitter probe is located at 0 degrees and the three receiving side ports at 106. 3, 120 and 270 degrees. These angles were chosen to fulfill the requirements and demands essential for PDA. Simulations using CFD have contributed with useful information for the flow behavior inside the vessel and how droplets are affected by it. These simulations gave information about the flow near the optical access side ports and the necessity of optical clearance. The simulations show that recirculated flow carries droplets from the spray that reaches the glass windows, which is not preferable as it may interfere during laser measurements. Initial test runs and experiments confirm the results obtained from the simulations. The outcome of this study became a development of a purging air wall to prevent droplets reaching the glass windows. <b>Fine</b> polished <b>fused</b> quartz glass, especially suitable for laser measurements is used for the glass windows. These glasses are free from inclusions and are distinguished from other glasses by good transmission in UV- and the visible spectral range. A solid mechanic calculation of the glass specimen was performed to determine the thickness of the glass in order to withstand a maximum pressure of 15 bar. An evacuation port was placed in the middle of the vessel to perform evacuation of gas. The evacuation is used for both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. During pressurized runs, a flange lid with a pressure control valve can be attached to this side port to regulate the pressure. Connections for adding a fluid level gauge were placed on the vessel side. On the top of the vessel a unique designed spray lance traversing system were attached on a flange lid. With this arrangement the spray can be rotated and traversed up and down through the top lid. This device enables measurements in a large part of the spray. The test facility has been installed and initial test runs performed. Measuring and optimization of the facility will continue. When optimized, the results of the measurements from this facility will be applied in the BLG project. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
