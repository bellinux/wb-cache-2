50|$|There was {{evidence}} that women performed not only housekeeping responsibilities like cooking and cleaning, but even other household activities like grinding, brewing, butchering, and spinning; and produced items like flour, ale, meat, cheese, and textile <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption</b> and for sale. An anonymous 15th-century English ballad appreciated activities performed by English peasant women such as housekeeping, making foodstuffs and textiles, and childcare. Even though cloth-making, brewing, and dairy production were trades associated with female workers, male cloth-makers and brewers increasingly displaced female workers, especially after water-mills, horizontal looms, and hop-flavored beers were invented. These inventions favored commercial cloth-making and brewing dominated by male workers who had more time, wealth, and access to credit and political influence and who produced goods for sale instead of <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption.</b> Meanwhile, women were increasingly relegated to low-paying tasks like spinning.|$|E

50|$|Until about 2005 the {{anchoveta}} {{was almost}} exclusively used for making fishmeal. Peru produces {{some of the}} highest quality fishmeal in the world. Since 2005 anchoveta is increasingly used <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption,</b> as fresh fish, as canned fish or as salted-matured fillets packed in oil. Peruvian canned anchoveta is sold as Peruvian canned sardines. The new use is sometimes called the second anchoveta boom, the first boom being the discovery and subsequent fishery and fishmeal production in the 1960s/70s. The second boom was kick-started by the Peruvian Fish Technology Institute CIP, assisted by FAO. A large scale promotion campaign including by the then-president of Peru Alan Garcia helped to make the anchoveta known to rich and poor alike. Previously it was not considered as food and hardly known among the population. It is now found in supermarkets and served in restaurants. Still, only 1 percent of anchovy catches are used <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption</b> and 99 percent continue to be reduced to fishmeal and oil.|$|R

50|$|A {{forest product}} is any {{material}} {{derived from a}} forestry <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption</b> or commercial use, such as lumber, paper, or forage for livestock. Wood, by far the dominant forest product, is used for many purposes, such as wood fuel (e.g. in form of firewood or charcoal) or the finished structural materials used {{for the construction of}} buildings, or as a raw material, in the form of wood pulp, that is used in the production of paper. All other non-wood products derived from forest resources, comprising a broad variety of other forest products, are collectively described as non-timber forest products.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{fish farming}} in the Mediterranean is a net fish consumer. Large amounts of animal feed {{are needed to}} feed a high trophic fish like the bluefin tuna. This feed {{consists}} of fishmeal processed from forage fishes like sardines and anchovies that humans would otherwise consume directly. In addition to ecological issues, this raises ethical issues. Much of the fish suitable <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption</b> {{is being used to}} grow higher trophic level fish to indulge a relatively small group of affluent consumers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper compares {{small and}} {{large-scale}} fishing {{operations in the}} North Atlantic, by examining key policy relevant variables such as (i) the number of fishers they employ, (ii) the proportion of total annual catch that is landed by the two groups, (iii) {{the value of the}} catch they land, and (iv) annual catch that goes to the reduction industry relative to its use <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> hu-man <b>consumption.</b> We gathered data from the litera-ture to analyze the performance of the two sectors for the Canadian and Norwegian fishing fleets. We then used these country case studies to make inferences on how these two sectors perform {{at the level of the}} North Atlantic. Results from the analysis indicate, among other things that, small-scale fisheries employ more people for the same landed value, and that more of their catch is used <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> human <b>consumption</b> than large-scale fisheries. In some countries large-scale op-erations were more profitable (e. g., Norway) but there were countries in which small-scale operations did bet-ter (e. g., France). All in all, this study indicates that small-scale fisheries are better positioned to meet sev-eral of the policy goals set by both national govern-ments and international organizations on the use of ocean resources...|$|R

50|$|Natural economy {{refers to}} a type of economy in which money is not used in the {{transfer}} of resources among people. It is a system of allocating resources through direct bartering, entitlement by law, or sharing out according to traditional custom. In the more complex forms of natural economy, some goods may act as a referent for fair bartering, but generally currency plays only a small role in allocating resources. As a corollary, the majority of goods produced {{in a system of}} natural economy are not produced for the purpose of exchanging them, but <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption</b> by the producers (subsistence).|$|E
50|$|Tubers {{were also}} {{cultivated}} as food. Sweet potatoes, {{one of the}} nation's largest crops, grew on an estimated 100,000 hectares, and they yielded 260,000 tons of produce {{a year in the}} 1980s. Manioc, or cassava, another major tuber, was mix-cropped on upwards of 60,000 hectares to produce between 150,000 and 260,000 tons a year, much of which was <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption.</b> The cultivation of yams, limited by the lack of deep moist soils, took up only 26,000 hectares. The tropical Pacific tuber taro, called malang√° in Haiti, grew with other tubers on more than 27,000 hectares.|$|E
50|$|Mucuna bracteata has {{green leaf}} foliage with leguminous nodules {{producing}} fixed nitrogen leading to amino acids. The seed of the legume of the Mucuna bracteata weighs about 90-190 mg each and is black in colour. This seed, {{as it is}} a legume, provides health benefits on its own, individually, <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption.</b> The foliage of the plant creates a shade covering over the soil it occupies, having a height of approximately 30-50 cm off the ground. This plant is a creeping type which grows rapidly and controls weed population in planted areas. With a release of leave foliage, the plant provides good mulching and composting properties to the soil surrounding it.|$|E

50|$|Patulin is a toxin {{produced}} by the P. expansum, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Paecilomyces fungal species. P. expansum is especially associated {{with a range of}} moldy fruits and vegetables, in particular rotting apples and figs. It is destroyed by the fermentation process and so is not found in apple beverages, such as cider. Although patulin has not been shown to be carcinogenic, it has been reported to damage the immune system in animals. In 2004, the European Community set limits to the concentrations of patulin in food products. They currently stand at 50 Œºg/kg in all fruit juice concentrations, at 25 Œºg/kg in solid apple products used <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consumption,</b> and at 10 Œºg/kg for children's apple products, including apple juice.|$|E
