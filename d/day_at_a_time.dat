5|$|Large {{crowds and}} an {{efficient}} organization meant that Sunday, the former resident of an orphan home, was soon netting hefty offerings. The first questions about Sunday's income were apparently raised during the Columbus, Ohio, campaign {{at the turn}} of 1912â€“13. During the Pittsburgh campaign a year later, Sunday spoke four times per day and effectively made $217 per sermon or $870 a <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the average gainfully employed worker made $836 per year. The major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City gave Sunday even larger offerings. Sunday donated Chicago's offering of $58,000 to Pacific Garden Mission and the $120,500 New York offering to war charities. Nevertheless, between 1908 and 1920, the Sundays earned over a million dollars; an average worker during the same period earned less than $14,000.|$|E

25|$|Laura Mackenzie Phillips (born November 10, 1959) is an American {{actress and}} singer {{best known for}} her roles in American Graffiti, as rebellious {{teenager}} Julie Mora Cooper Horvath on the sitcom One <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> and for the Disney Channel science fiction show So Weird.|$|E
25|$|After two near-fatal overdoses, Phillips voluntarily entered Fair Oaks Hospital {{to undergo}} treatment. After she {{completed}} treatment in 1981, {{the producers of}} One <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> invited {{her back to the}} show. However, in 1982, Phillips resumed her cocaine use and the following year, she collapsed on the show's set. When she refused to take a drug test, she was fired again, this time for good. Her character was written out of the series. In 1992, she entered a long-term drug rehabilitation program and underwent intensive treatment for nine months.|$|E
25|$|Phillips gained stardom in the 1970s, {{when she}} played boy-crazy {{teenager}} Julie Cooper (when the character got married, her married name was Horvath) on the long-running television show One <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> {{for which she}} earned $50,000 a week. During the show's third season in 1977, Phillips was arrested for disorderly conduct. Because of her drug and alcohol abuse, Phillips began arriving late and was even incoherent for rehearsals. The producers ordered her to take a six-week break to overcome her addiction but were ultimately forced to fire her in 1980.|$|E

25|$|With season two, {{the series}} moved up {{an hour to}} the Wednesday 9:00pm time slot, where it stayed for three years. During that time, the series competed with such popular shows as One <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> The Jeffersons, and Diff'rent Strokes. The {{transition}} from Fawcett to Cheryl Ladd in the second season proved to be popular with viewers. While viewership dipped marginally in the second season, the series still remained {{in the top five}} for the 197778 season, placing fourth in the ratings, tying with 60 Minutes and All in the Family. In the third season, viewership stabilized, but the series began losing traction as it ranked twelfth behind newcomers Mork & Mindy, The Ropers, and Taxi for the 197879 season. With Jackson's departure and Shelley Hack entering the cast, the show's fourth season saw some ratings erosion as it ranked seventeenth for the 197980 season.|$|E
25|$|On {{the battlefields}} of France in spring 1918, the war-weary Allied armies enthusiastically welcomed the fresh American troops. They {{arrived at the}} rate of 10,000 a <b>day,</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the Germans were unable to replace their losses. The Americans won a victory at Cantigny, then again in {{defensive}} stands at Chateau-Thierry and Belleau Wood. The Americans helped the British Empire, French and Portuguese forces defeat and turned back the powerful final German offensive (Spring Offensive of March to July, 1918), and most importantly, the Americans {{played a role in the}} Allied final offensive (Hundred Days Offensive of August to November). However, many American commanders used the same flawed tactics which the British, French, Germans and others had abandoned early in the war, and so many American offensives were not particularly effective. Pershing continued to commit troops to these full- frontal attacks, resulting in high casualties against experienced veteran German and Austrian-Hungarian units. Nevertheless, the infusion of new and fresh US troops greatly strengthened the Allies' strategic position and boosted morale. The Allies achieved victory over Germany on November 11, 1918 after German morale had collapsed both at home and on the battlefield.|$|E

500|$|Mint Director Henry Linderman {{stated in}} 1873 of Peale, [...] "Although Mr. Peale {{undoubtedly}} received {{the cooperation of}} , the inventions and improvements were peculiarly Mr. Peale's. [...] I have no doubt whatever on that point. They were of almost incalculable value to the public service." [...] George G. Evans, in his late 19th century history of the Mint, described Peale, [...] "his mildness, integrity, gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer". Walter Breen deemed Peale, [...] "brilliant but unscrupulous". Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint, [...] "during the generation from about 1830 to 1855, the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was the consummate 'machinist' of the <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when this term encompassed imaginative design, planning, construction and improvement of working processes... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite. Results {{of many of his}} ideas lasted a century or more, until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs." [...] According to Bowers, [...] "today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles, each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions." ...|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit.
