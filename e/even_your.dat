Since our country was {{attacked}} on September 11, 2001, you have served on the frontlines in directly confronting the dangers of the 21st century. Because of your service, plots have been disrupted, American lives have been saved, and our Allies and partners have been more secure. Your triumphs and <b>even</b> <b>your</b> names may be unknown to your fellow Americans, but your service is deeply appreciated." ...|$|E

You don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely." [...] Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

John Montgomery for MTV News commented on Aguilera's [...] "bad girl" [...] image, writing [...] "though Aguilera's mostly going for glam here, she's also plenty bad, too, {{swinging}} her way into some servicemen's heart, coyly sipping on a milkshake and shaking it so hard your <b>even</b> <b>your</b> grandpa had to notice." [...] The video brought Aguilera and Rolston an MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Direction at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Justin Timberlake's [...] "What Goes Around...

500|$|By 1910 the Diary was {{beginning}} to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay [...] "On People in Books", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the Diary as [...] "one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time... a glory for us all". Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, {{the former prime minister}} who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had [...] "purchased and given away more copies than any living man... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it". Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—"an illiterate charwoman, it is true"—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition [...] proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition The Bookman s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: [...] "You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and <b>even</b> <b>your</b> admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human".|$|E

[...] Haider claimed that the legislators understood his comment as a criticism of the present Austrian government, but {{in the days that}} followed the SPÖ joined with the ÖVP in a vote of no confidence against him.|$|E

Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so just think that one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or <b>even</b> <b>your</b> 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E
