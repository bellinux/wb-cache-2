5|$|Love darts, {{also known}} as {{shooting}} darts, or just as darts, are shaped in many distinctive ways which vary considerably between species. What all the shapes of love darts have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> their harpoon-like or needle-like ability to pierce.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
25|$|What most touch pieces have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{that they}} have to be touched or in close {{physical}} contact for the power concerned to be obtained and/or transferred. Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an amulet.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Constantin Brâncuși differ {{considerably}} from others through lack of severe planar faceting {{often associated with}} those of prototypical Cubists such as Archipenko, Csaky and Duchamp-Villon (themselves already very different from one another). However, <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> the tendency toward simplification and abstract representation.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the efforts}} are truly {{synthetic}} but in others a precursor molecule found in nature is included. The key data are collected below. What all strategies have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> synthesis of the baccatin molecule followed by last stage addition of the tail, a process (except for one) based on the Ojima lactam.|$|E
25|$|Natsuki is {{a friend}} and classmate of Kanade; {{something}} that they both share <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> their shy nature. Because Natsuki barely talks at all, and is usually emotionless, {{it is difficult to}} tell what she is thinking. The most important person to her is Kanade, her only friend. In Your Diary +, she is promoted to a heroine from a sub-character.|$|E

25|$|Many machine models {{different}} from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models {{can be converted to}} another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> that the machines operate deterministically.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on very particular and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E

25|$|Another protein, aequorin, {{found in}} certain jellyfish, {{produces}} blue {{light in the}} presence of calcium. It can be used in molecular biology to assess calcium levels in cells. What these biological reactions have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> their use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Though the structure of the molecules that produce luminescence is different for each species, they are given the generic name of luciferin. Firefly luciferin can be oxidized to produce an excited complex. Once it falls back down to a ground state a photon is released. It is very similar to the reaction with luminol.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed that the}} {{elements}} in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, {{all of the other}} elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that all do have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E

25|$|The Khatik {{are widely}} {{distributed}} community in North India, and each Khatik group, {{has its own}} origin myth. What they have <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>is</b> that they were historically kshtriyas who were assigned to kill animals in yagas performed by kings.Also today,only khatiks has right to kill animals during bali offerings at Hindu temples. According to their traditions, the god Brahma assigned to them a goats skin, the bark of trees and lac- so they could graze cattle, dye skins of goat, and deer; and tan hides with bark and lac. Another tradition, claims that {{the origin of the}} word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing. They relate this to early days when they used to supply mutton to the kings of Rajasthan. While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E

In Naples this is tomato, anchovies and buffalo mozzarella. In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil, with salted sardines. The Provençal variety uses onions, black olives, and anchovies.|$|E
2500|$|Of the 11 sermons in the OIHB and ONHB have <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> two <b>are</b> found <b>in</b> what is {{possibly}} the oldest Icelandic manuscript fragment, AM 237a fol: dated to 1150. [...] These texts are the ‘Stave-church Homily’ and a sermon for St. Michael’s Day. [...] Indrebø {{has shown that}} the 11 sermons <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>are</b> copies of copies, at least. [...] Similarly, he concluded that AM 237a fol is a copy of a copy, and was itself probably a remnant of a homiliary itself. [...] This implies that at least some material in the manuscript belongs to before 1150.|$|R
