50|$|There {{are several}} types of warship available: {{dreadnought}} battleships, battleships, cruisers, fleet aircraft carriers, light carriers, destroyers, and submarines. Each power starts out with {{a certain number of}} ships of each type, and a number of ships under construction, usually launching around their historical commission <b>date.</b> Additional <b>ships</b> can be constructed, but only to replace ships previously lost in battle, either by the player or prior to the scenario's start <b>date.</b> <b>Ship</b> construction can be scheduled for 6-24 months out; the closer the launch date, the more industrial power will be expended during construction. Materials are consumed as well, dependent on the type of hull being built, and the ship ratings chosen during design. The ship class chosen during construction is cosmetic only; it does not affect actual ship limitations or attributes like the actual hull type does.|$|R

500|$|Early Egyptians {{knew how}} to {{assemble}} planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as 3000BC.
