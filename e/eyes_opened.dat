5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
25|$|Nueva Trova, {{initially}} so popular, {{was dealt}} a blow {{by the fall}} of the Soviet Union, though it was already fading. It suffered inside Cuba, perhaps from a growing disenchantment with one-party rule, and externally, from the vivid contrast with the Buena Vista Social Club film and recordings. Audiences round the world have had their <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> to the extraordinary charm and musical quality of the older forms of Cuban music. By contrast, topical themes that seemed so relevant in the 1960s and 70s now seem dry and passé; once a theme is no longer topical, the piece rests solely on its musical quality. Those pieces of high musical and lyrical quality, amongst which Puebla's Hasta siempre stands out, will probably last as long as Cuba lasts.|$|E
25|$|Newborn golden mice {{are fairly}} coordinated at birth; however, {{they have a}} {{tendency}} to remain quietly in one spot. By day 1, they are able to take their first steps and right themselves up easily. Their prehensile tail tendencies become evident by day 2 and by day 4 they exhibit a sense of balance and are able to balance themselves and hang upside down. By day 10, young golden mice display a tendency to crawl upward and by day 15, they are able to jump. Days 17 and 18 are when young mice are seen to become even more active, yet they remain docile when held in a hand. The first attempts at bathing have been observed at day 7 and by day 12, young golden mice attempt to wash behind their ears but they are still relatively unsteady. Between days 12 to 21 newborn golden mice bathe frequently and thoroughly. By day 21, a considerable amount of time was spent outside the nest. Upon birth, if handled every few days once their <b>eyes</b> <b>opened,</b> the mice became more docile and were easily managed through their adult life. If young golden mice were not handled frequently during this period, {{they were more likely to}} be wild and difficult to manage.|$|E
40|$|Body sway was {{investigated}} in 20 healthy subjects to determine whether visual input must contain motion feedback information from the surroundings in order to influence postural control. Posturography was used to record body sway under the following visual conditions: <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> {{with or without a}} restricted visual field; <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in ganzfield white light; <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in darkness with a head-fixed visual target; <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in darkness; and eyes closed in darkness. Stance was perturbed by means of a pseudorandomly applied vibratory stimulation to the calf muscles. Least sway was found with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in an unrestricted visual field but increased in a restricted visual field. Greatest sway was found without visual motion feedback, i. e. under the following conditions: <b>eyes</b> closed; <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in darkness; <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in ganzfield white light; and with a head-mounted fixation point. Sway was significantly (p < 0. 05) greater with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in darkness compared with eyes closed during the initial 50 s with perturbations. After 150 s, sway was almost identical under the four test conditions without visual motion feedback. Standing with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> in darkness was initially a disadvantage compared with having the eyes closed. The postural control system may be programmed to expect visual feedback information when the <b>eyes</b> are <b>open,</b> which may delay changes in postural strategy...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-four healthy men, 22 to 25 {{years of}} age, {{were exposed to}} {{stressful}} accelerations in a rotating room until acute mild motion sickness was elicited. Thirteen subjects in one group were exposed first with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and later with eyes covered; the reverse order was used with the remaining eleven in the other group. The stressful accelerations were generated by requiring the subject to execute 120 standardized head movements at each 1 -rpm increase in angular velocity until the desired endpoint was reached. When susceptibility to motion sickness with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and covered is compared, 19 subjects were more susceptible with <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> three with <b>eyes</b> covered, and in the remaining two susceptibility was the same. The maximum difference in velocity between trial 1 and 2 was 7 rpm when susceptibility was greater with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and 3 rpm when it was greater with eyes covered; the means, respectively, were 3. 2 and 2. 0 rpm. Among subjects manifesting greater susceptibility with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> than covered the group differences were small, indicating little or no adaptation effects. The findings are discussed mainly {{on the basis that}} vision may act also to decrease susceptibility under the stimulus conditions described...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To evaluate, {{by means}} of {{electronic}} baropodometry (EB), the postural findings in patients affected by ocular torticollis. METHODS: Posturographic analysis (length of the sway path, sway area, and mean velocity) was made in 54 patients with IV palsy, Duane Syndrome, or rectus superior palsy (group A) and compared with a control group of 45 healthy subjects (group B). The test was performed with both <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> then both closed, then with the affected <b>eye</b> <b>open,</b> and finally with the healthy <b>eye</b> <b>open.</b> RESULTS: With both <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> or closed, {{the length of the}} sway path, the sway area, and mean velocity were significantly increased in group A compared with group B (P< 0. 0001). When the <b>open</b> <b>eye</b> was the one with the muscular paresis, the length of the sway path was significantly increased as compared with the healthy eye (P< 0. 0001), and the sway area was increased too (P< 0. 029).

40|$|Introduction : The {{development}} of civilisation {{and the modern}} lifestyle of children and teenagers have caused {{an increase in the}} number of cases of faulty body posture. Aim of the research: To analyse the relationship between posture defects and the speed of the centre of foot pressure in school-age children. Material and methods: The research included 503 girls and boys aged 12 – 15 years. The research approach used a spatial photogrammetry technique. Lateral speed and anteroposterior speed of the centre of foot pressure were tested on a Cosmogamma platform. Results : Lateral speed ranged from 8. 22 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 7. 63 mm/s with eyes closed. In correct posture, from 8. 45 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 7. 64 mm/s with eyes closed. In the defective posture, from 7. 90 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 7. 63 mm/s with eyes closed. Antero-posterior speed varied from 10. 50 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 10. 56 mm/s with eyes closed. In the correct posture, from 10. 73 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 10. 64 mm/s with eyes closed. In the defective posture, from 10. 17 mm/s with <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> to 10. 45 mm/s with eyes closed. Conclusions: Analysis of variance of lateral speed showed a significant effect only of test options (p < 0. 002). Lateral speed in the test with eyes closed significantly decreased both in the correct and defective posture. There were no significant differences, however, in lateral speed between the correct and incorrect posture. Analysis of variance did not show any significant effects for anteroposterior speed...|$|R
