40|$|The {{slowdown}} in world trade had less {{impact on the}} maritime freight markets in 1991 than had been expected. Because {{of the effects of}} the Middle East crisis, and of the rapid change in the USSR, shipping demand and freight rates took a more owner-friendly turn than could have been foreseen at the end of 1990. There was strong <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>space</b> in the bulk trades, especially for Russian grain imports which had been held over from the preceding year, and the sharp fall of freight rates came to an end. The tanker markets received a considerable boost from the war requirements; they were soon depressed again, however, by the latent oversupply of tonnage. The liner trades showed diverging trends, with sustained high growth rates in the Europe-Far Eastern trades. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the development of Sri Lankan exports over the recent past and try to highlight a relationship between exports and shipping services, which can be used <b>for</b> forecasting future <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> services derived by country’s exports. Evolution of Sri Lankan exports from early post-independence era to present and the historical background of country’s economic policies that have affected the export sector are being studied to get an in depth understanding of trend, patterns and performance of country’s export sector. Data analysis is carried out using already established statistical methods and deep researches in to the plausibility of those methods are not aim of the study. The study is structured to test the plausibility of two hypotheses. Regression analysis used to find relationship between cargo loaded and value of exports. Vector Auto regression analysis used to forecast a best forecasting model <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>demand</b> using export in the country. First hypothesis is Sri Lankan exports derive a <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> services and the second is that the derived <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> by exports can be forecasted by using export performance data over a period of time. The conclusion of the study is that the two hypotheses that were tested are valid...|$|R

50|$|Business Model: During {{the heyday}} of China’s export-led growth, the core task of the port (like {{the rest of the}} Chinese {{logistic}} system) was simply to provide outlets for the export sector, and inlets for their raw materials. With <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> growing exponentially, the task for the Port was to keep up, increasing capability as fast as possible by expanding channels, building more berths, enhancing cargo handling capability and improving its ability to process more complex cargoes, faster.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century the squadrons of the Dutch fleet were {{reinforced}} with merchant <b>ships</b> adapted <b>for</b> battle in earlier conflicts.

The flagship of the Republic, De Zeven Provinciën, was fitted with 96 guns. For comparison, the British , built more than a century later, had only 8 guns more.|$|R
50|$|The years {{leading up}} to the Civil War were {{characterized}} by extremely rapid production in ship building. The 538,136 tons registered in foreign trade in 1831 had increased to 1,047,454 in 1847 and to 2,496,894 in 1862, a figure which represented the culmination of our ship-building tonnage until surpassed in WW I. From 1848 to 1858 ship building had been maintained at an average of 400,000 tons a year. This construction was caused by two conditions, the development of the clipper ship after 1845 and the increased <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{increased}} <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> was {{the result}} of several factors. The discovery in 1848 of gold in California was a major cause along with the wars between Great Britain and China in 1840-42 and 1856-60 threw a part of the China trade into American hands. The revolutionary outbreaks of 1848 interrupted European trade, with a resultant benefit to Americans, while the Crimean War, which occupied many European boats in transporting troops and supplies, gave new openings to American ships. In addition the natural growth in population, wealth, and production necessitated increased shipping.|$|R

50|$|In {{the north}} east (including Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Newcastle-upon-Tyne) this was {{especially}} so. The north east was a major centre of the shipbuilding industry. The Depression caused a collapse in <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>ships.</b> Between 1929 and 1932 ship production declined by 90%, and this in turn affected all the supply industries such as steel and coal. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70%. Among the worst affected towns was Jarrow, where unemployment led to the famous Jarrow March, in which unemployed workers marched 300 mi to London to protest against unemployment.|$|R
50|$|Armstrong also {{wished to}} take {{advantage}} of the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping,</b> so moving south from the Columbia to the Kootenay, he built the small sternwheeler Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing, about 12 mi north of the present town of Wasa. Instead of taking the ore south to Jennings, Armstrong's plan was to move the ore north across Canal Flats and then down the Columbia to the CPR railhead at Golden. As described, Armstrong took Gwendoline through the Baillie-Grohman canal in the fall of 1893 (or rolled her across Canal Flats), fitted her out at Golden, and returned through the canal in the spring of 1894.|$|R

40|$|The growing {{service sector}} {{in the global economy}} signifies the need for {{applying}} service science to study the interdisciplinary nature of services. In particular, container shipping service is considered a key enabler of international trade and global economic development. To strengthen the role of shipping in supporting global seaborne trade, it is highly desirable to identify the determinants that influence the total capacity of the shipping industry, explain how the related business activities (e. g., <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>shipping</b> service, vessel price, fleet size, etc.) are linked to the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> container <b>shipping</b> service, and empirically verify the findings. This study builds on the demand chain management paradigm to analyze the service capacity of the container shipping industry. We establish a path-analytic model to explain how shipping demand affects such shipping-related variables as vessel price and to evaluate their effects on the service capacity of the industry. The empirically-tested model provides managers and researchers with insights on how to enhance the coordination and integration of a series of shipping-related variables from shipping demand to capacity management in the container shipping service industry.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) <b>for</b> <b>ships</b> in ports. Due to the increasing <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>ships</b> carrying containers, the BAP can be considered as a major optimization problem in marine terminals. In this paper, the BAP is considered as dynamic and modeled in discrete case and we propose a new alternative to solve it. The proposed alternative is based on applying the Clustering Search (CS) method using the Simulated Annealing (SA) for solutions generation. The CS is an iterative method which divides the search space in clusters and it is composed of a metaheuristic for solutions generation, a grouping process and a local search heuristic. The computational results are compared against recent methods found in the literature. Pages: 5499 - 550...|$|R
