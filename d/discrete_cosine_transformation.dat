40|$|Abstract—During {{the last}} years, digital lecture {{libraries}} and lecture video portals {{have become more}} and more popular. However, finding efficient methods for indexing multimedia still remains a challenging task. Since the text displayed in a lecture video is closely related to the lecture content, it provides a valuable source for indexing and retrieving lecture contents. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic lecture video indexing based on video OCR technology. We have developed a novel video segmenter for automated slide video structure analysis and a weighted DCT (<b>discrete</b> <b>cosines</b> <b>transformation)</b> based text detector. A dynamic image constrast/brightness adaption serves the purpose of enhancing the text image quality to make it processible by existing common OCR software. Time-based text occurence information as well as the analyzed text content are further used for indexing. We prove the accuracy of the proposed approach by evaluation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the science of {{secretly}} embedding and communicating data has gained tremendous significance due to the technological advancement in communication and digital content. Steganography {{is the art of}} concealing secret data in a particular interactive media transporter such as text, audio, image, and video data in order to build a covert communication between authorized parties. Nowadays, video steganography techniques are important in many video-sharing and social networking applications such as Livestreaming, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook because of noteworthy developments in advanced video over the Internet. The performance of any steganography method, ultimately, relies on the imperceptibility, hiding capacity, and robustness against attacks. Although many video steganography methods exist, several of them lack the preprocessing stages. In addition, less security, low embedding capacity, less imperceptibility, and less robustness against attacks are other issues that affect these algorithms. This dissertation investigates and analyzes cutting edge video steganography techniques in both compressed and raw domains. Moreover, it provides solutions for the aforementioned problems by proposing new and effective methods for digital video steganography. The key objectives of this research are to develop: 1) a highly secure video steganography algorithm based on error correcting codes (ECC); 2) an increased payload video steganography algorithm in the discrete wavelet domain based on ECC; 3) a novel video steganography algorithm based on Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracking and ECC; 4) a robust video steganography algorithm in the wavelet domain based on KLT tracking and ECC; 5) a new video steganography algorithm based on the multiple object tracking (MOT) and ECC; and 6) a robust and secure video steganography algorithm in the discrete wavelet and <b>discrete</b> <b>cosine</b> <b>transformations</b> based on MOT and ECC. The experimental results from our research demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve higher embedding capacity as well as better imperceptibility of stego videos. Furthermore, the preprocessing stages increase the security and robustness of the proposed algorithms against attacks when compared to state-of-the-art steganographic methods...|$|R

40|$|Discrete transformations {{are widely}} used {{in the fields of}} signal and image processing. Applications in the areas of data compression, {{template}} matching, signal filtering pattern recognition all utilise various discrete transforms. The calculation of transformations is a computationally intensive task which in most practical applications requires considerable computing resources. This characteristic has restricted the use of many transformations to applications with smaller datasets or where real-time performance is not essential. This restriction can be removed by the application of parallel processing techniques to the calculation of discrete transformations. The aim of this thesis is to determine efficient parallel algorithms and processor topologies for the implementation of the <b>discrete</b> Walsh, <b>cosine,</b> Haar and D 4 Daubauchies transforms, and to compare the operation of the parallel algorithms running on T 800 Transputers with the equivalent serial von Neumann type algorithm. This thesis also examines the transformations of a number of test functions in order to determine their ability to represent various common global and locally defined functions. It was found that the parallel algorithms developed {{during the course of this}} thesis for the <b>discrete</b> Walsh, <b>cosine,</b> Haar and D 4 Daubauchies transforms could all be efficiently implemented on a hypercube processor topology. Development of a number of parallel algorithms also led to the discovery of a new parallel algorithm for the calculation of any transformation which can be expressed as a Kronecker or tensor product/sum. A hypercube based algorithm was devised which converts the Kronecker product to a Hadamard product on a hypercube structure. This provides a simple algorithm for parallel implementations. Examination of the four sets of transform coefficients for the test functions revealed that all the transforms examined were not suitable for representing functions with large numbers of discontinuity's such as the chirp function. Also, transforms with local basis functions such as the Haar and D 4 Daubauchies transforms provided better representations of localised functions than transforms consisting of global basis function sets such as the <b>discrete</b> Walsh and <b>cosine</b> <b>transformations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Steganography {{comes from}} the Greek words steganos, roughly {{translating}} as “covered writing”. Steganographic techniques allow one party to communicate information to another without a third party even knowing that the communication is occurred. The ways to deliver these “secret messages” is vary greatly. “The goal of steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless messages {{in a way that}} it does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second secret message present. ” Steganography is a process that involves hiding a message in an appropriate carrier for example an image or an audio file. The carrier can then be sent to a receiver without anyone else knowing that it contains a hidden message. There are various technique being used in hiding the message using steganography practice, namely digital watermarking, least significant bit (LSB), fractal codes, masking and filtering, algorithms and transformations, Discrete wavelet transformation, <b>Discrete</b> <b>Cosine</b> <b>Transformation</b> and many more. This project will implement <b>Discrete</b> <b>Cosine</b> <b>Transformation</b> (DCT) as steganography technique in hiding text into an image.
