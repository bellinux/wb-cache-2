40|$|Raising of problem. Constructions and {{buildings}} can be destroyed or damaged {{from the action}} of technogenic catastrophes, failures and natural phenomena. An accident takes place, if a rightness is violated: project decisions and normative descriptions, making of plant wares, building editing. On occasion building get damages {{as a result of}} action of some not alone factor, and their total action. Dismantling of the damaged constructions is executed without the account <b>of</b> <b>destructions</b> character <b>of</b> objects, in particular their upper floors and roof. Therefore determination <b>of</b> character <b>of</b> <b>destructions</b> <b>of</b> overhead floors of buildings, constructions and development of technological decisions on their renewal is the scientific and technical issue of the day. Purpose. Determination <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>destructions</b> character <b>of</b> upper floors of building, as initial information for making decision on realization of works. Conclusion. The most frequent reasons <b>of</b> <b>destructions</b> <b>of</b> upper floors of building are: increase of loading over normative; decline in the process of exploitation the descriptions on durability of constructions from the action of various factors - of moisture, temperature, wear. <b>Destructions</b> <b>of</b> building have a credible character. At the same time there are separate conformities to law <b>of</b> their <b>destruction</b> and general chart of development of this process. The local damages of separate elements of buildings and constructions which spread to the contiguous constructions and knots pass at first.
