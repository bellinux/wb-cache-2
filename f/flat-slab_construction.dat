40|$|Flat-slab RC {{buildings}} exhibit {{several advantages}} over conventional moment-resisting frames. However the structural effectiveness of <b>flat-slab</b> <b>construction</b> is hindered by its alleged inferior performance under earthquake loading. This {{is a possible}} reason for the observation that no fragility analysis has been undertaken for this widely-used structural system. This study focuses on the derivation of fragility curves using medium-rise flat-slab buildings with masonry infill walls. The developed curves were compared {{with those in the}} literature, derived for moment-resisting RC frames. The study concluded that earthquake losses for flat-slab structures are in the same range as for moment-resisting frames for low limit states, and considerably different at high damage levels. Observed differences are justifiable on the grounds of structural response characteristics of the two structural forms...|$|E
40|$|The {{study has}} three main {{objective}}s. The first {{objective is to}} investigate the fragility of flat-slab reinforced concrete systems. Developing the fragility information of <b>flat-slab</b> <b>construction</b> will be a novel achievement since the issue {{has not been the}} concern of any research in the literature. The second objective is to assess HAZUS as an open-source, nationally accepted earthquake loss estimation software environment. It is important to understand the potentials and the limitations of the methodology, the relationship between the hazard, damage and the loss modules, and the plausibility of the results before using it for the purposes of hazard mitigation, preparedness or recovery. The last objective is to implement the fragility information obtained for the flat-slab structural system into HAZUS. The methodology involves many built-in specific building types, but does not include flat-slab structures. Hence it will be extra achievement to develop HAZUScompatible fragility curves to be used within the methodology. National Science Foundation EEC- 970178...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flat-slab</b> <b>{{construction}}</b> {{has been}} widely used in construction today because of many advantages that it offers. The basic philosophy {{in the design of}} flat slab is to consider only gravity forces; this method ignores the effect of punching shear due to unbalanced moments at the slab column junction which is critical. An attempt has been made to generate generalized design sheets which accounts both punching shear due to gravity loads and unbalanced moments for cases (a) interior column; (b) edge column (bending perpendicular to shorter edge); (c) edge column (bending parallel to shorter edge); (d) corner column. These design sheets are prepared as per codal provisions of IS 456 - 2000. These design sheets will be helpful in calculating the shear reinforcement to be provided at the critical section which is ignored in many design offices. Apart from its usefulness in evaluating punching shear and the necessary shear reinforcement, the design sheets developed will enable the designer to fix the depth of flat slab during the initial phase of the design...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} {{increase in the number of}} tall buildings, both residential and commercial, and modern trend is towards taller structures. Flat slab is most widely used systems in reinforced concrete <b>construction.</b> <b>Flat-slab</b> building structures possesses major advantages over traditional slab-beam-column structures taking a advantages of reduced floor height, shorter construction time, architectural â€“functional and economical aspects. But in flat slab building columns are directly provides supports to slab with eliminating beams so there is requirement of provision of shear walls to increase the stiffness of building against lateral forces. Shear wall system are one of the most commonly used lateral load resisting in high rise building. Shear wall has high in plane stiffness and strength. The present paper reviews various research works carried out by several researchers on multi-storied buildings provided with flat slab and shear walls...|$|R
40|$|Now a {{days the}} use of flat slab {{building}} provides many advantages over conventional RC Frame building in terms of architectural flexibility, use of space, easier formwork and shorter construction time. The structural efficiency of the <b>flat-slab</b> <b>construction</b> is hindered by its poor performance under earthquake loading. Whereas the conventional beam slab buildings perform better in seismic regions. In the present work another model with alternate floor flat slab and beam slab is considered and all the nine structures are compared. Conventional RC frame structure, Flat Slab structure and alternate floor flat-beam slab structure of G+ 10 story of plan size of 30 mx 30 m have been considered. The performance of Conventional RC frame structure, Flat Slab structure and alternate floor flat-beam slab structure were studied and for the analysis, seismic zone II is considered. The analysis is done with using E-Tabs 2015 software. It is necessary to analyze seismic behavior of building to see what parameters are going to changes in conventional RC Frame building, flat slab building and alternate floor flat-beam slab building with corner shear wall, middle shear wall and without shear wall. Therefore, {{the characteristics of the}} seismic behavior of flat slab and conventional RC Frame buildings suggest that additional measures for guiding the conception and design of these structures in seismic regions are needed and to improve the performance of building having conventional RC building and flat slabs under seismic loading, The objective of the present work is to examine the feasibility of Alternate floor flat slab-beam slab structure and compare the behavior of these nine types of buildings under seismic forces. Present work provides a good source of information on storey drift, storey displacement, base shear, storey shear, column forces and time perio...|$|E
