5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cooler air mass.|$|E

As each master carrier travels through the channel, it collides with and collects the other carriers one-by-one. This growing group of carriers is pushed toward <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage, causing the fabric to bunch near the curtain's moving edge.|$|R

30|$|To {{minimize}} reobstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubal ostium after salpingostomy, everting <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fimbrial ostium {{is often}} advocated. This {{can be done}} by suturing <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ostium to <b>the</b> surrounding wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube (suturing technique) or by everting <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fimbrial ostium by heating <b>the</b> serosal surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube surrounding the ostium using electrical or laser energy (flowering technique). The suturing technique is the gold standard during laparotomy and microtubal surgery [3], while the flowering technique is utilized during operative laparoscopy as being an easier technique to learn.|$|R
40|$|We present <b>the</b> {{possibility}} <b>of</b> using a triplet as an {{intraocular lens}} (IOL).

We have also compared the size, the thickness, the power, the distances between <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOL and the endothelium, and the distances between <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOL and the iris to the typical concave-plane lens that is usually implanted in highly myopic eyes. As we can see, when the anterior chamber depth is normal, our triplet presents a better geometrical form than the concave-plane lens...|$|R

5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In <b>the</b> {{first part}} <b>of</b> this work we provide {{a formula for}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hasse diagram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{independent}} subsets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hth power <b>of</b> a path ordered by inclusion. For h = 1 such a value is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> a Fibonacci cube. We show that, in general, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diagram is obtained by convolution of a Fibonacci-like sequence with itself. In the second part we consider <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> cycles.
