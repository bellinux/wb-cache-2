A second mill (Denton's Mill, also called Yellow mill) was built on Denton's mill pond, after being granted permission to dredge from the creek to the mill pond once located between Fifth Ave and the present day canal at Carroll and Third Street. On May 26, 1664, several Breuckelen residents, headed by Brouwer, petitioned director general Peter Stuyvesant and his Council for permission to <b>dredge</b> <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> at their own expense through the land of Frederick Lubbertsen in order to supply water to run the mill. The petition was presented to the council on May 29, 1664, and the motion was granted. Another mill, Cole's Mill, was located just about at present day 9th Street, between Smith Street and the Canal. Cole's Mill Pond, located north of 9th street, occupied the present location of Public Place.|$|R
40|$|Kerch Strait was {{the main}} passage between the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. The passage of ships through the strait is {{hampered}} by several physical and geographical factors: emerged and submerged morphology, the climatic and hydrological parameters. As {{a result of the}} extremely low depths of the strait, for the safety of navigation, authorities have been forced to <b>dredge</b> <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> for passage of the vessels with a medium draft, to make a properly hydrographical develop¬ment of the fairway and of the shores, and to establish a favorable anchoring area etc. Ice, which occurs in winter, makes the navigation very difficult, which takes place in convoys, preceded by ice breakers. Fog, frequent in the transitional seasons, hampered navigation; many accidents happened because of this inconvenience. Most accidents due to weather conditions (fog, wind) are specific to smaller vessels, sea-river type, which are sailing in the area and which, due to their construction, are not able to deal with exceptional weather conditions at sea. The existence of surface currents, with the dominant direction north-south, from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea, affects navigation only around the heads where cau¬ses circular currents. In this case are affected only pleasure boats and low powered vessel. With all these impediments to navigation, the Kerch Strait is an important waterway, especially for the countries bordering the Sea of Azov: Ukraine and the Russian Federation, and also for the countries from the Black Sea basin...|$|R

40|$|Management of {{the limited}} fresh water {{resources}} on small oceanic islands has become critical with increasing population and development in coastal areas. Canals, dredged for waterfront property and boat access, penetrate water-bearing material and accelerate the natural discharge from fresh water lenses. Big Pine Key, located in the southern portion of the Florida Keys, is a heterogeneous, two-layer island with several canal networks. The island is approximately 3 km wide and 10 km long. The upper hydros-tratigraphic unit (Miami Oolite Limestone) has a hydraulic conductivity of 100 meters per day (m/day). The lower unit (Key Largo Limestone) has a hydraulic conductivity of 1200 m/day. To quantify the effects of canals on the fresh water lens of Big Pine Key, a numerical model was developed using the Dupuit and Ghyben-Herzberg assumptions. The thickness of the fresh water lens is sensitive {{to the location of}} the boundary between the upper and lower hydros-tratigraphic layers. A simulation of present-day Big Pine Key, including canals, compared with predevel-opment conditions shows that the total volume of the lens has decreased by 20 % in response to the <b>dredging</b> of <b>canals.</b> <b>As</b> <b>dredging</b> of <b>canals</b> will certainly continue in the future, the numerical model was also used to investigate the types of canals that are most detrimental to a fresh water lens. For an island 3 km wide and 10 km long, <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> that penetrates 2 km lengthwise into the island reduces the volume of the fresh water lens by 6. 5 %. For the same island dimensions, <b>a</b> <b>canal</b> that penetrates 2 km through the mid-section of the island reduces the volume of the fresh water lens by 7. 1 %. Several short <b>canals,</b> with <b>a</b> combined total length of 2 km decrease the volume of the fresh water lens by 4. 0 %. The deeper the penetration of the canal into the lens, the greater the influence of the canal. Therefore, several short canals are preferred over one long canal because shorter canals have less of an effect on the total volume of the fresh water lens. Canals also focus ground water discharge. The three configurations of 2000 m long canals each discharge 13 to 15 % of the total recharge to the island...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{comprehensive}} investigation has been carried out to quantify the possible effects of <b>dredging</b> <b>a</b> navigable <b>canal</b> on the hydrogeological system underlying a coastal lagoon. The study is focused on the Venice Lagoon, Italy, where the port authority is planning to open a new 10  m deep and 3  km long canal to connect the city passenger terminal to the central lagoon inlet, thus avoiding the passage of large cruise ships through the historic center of Venice. A modeling study has been developed to evaluate the short (minutes), medium (months), and long (decades) term processes of water and pollutant exchange between the shallow aquifer system and the lagoon, possibly enhanced by the canal excavation, and ship wakes. An in-depth characterization of the lagoon subsurface along the channel has supported the numerical modeling. Piezometer and sea level records, geophysical acquisitions, laboratory analyses of groundwater and sediment samples (chemical analyses and ecotoxicity testing), and the outcome of 3 -D hydrodynamic and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been used to set up and calibrate the subsurface multi-model approach. The numerical outcomes allow us to quantify the groundwater volume and estimate the mass of anthropogenic contaminants (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) likely leaked from the nearby industrial area over the past decades, and released into the lagoon from the canal bed by the action of depression waves generated by ships. Moreover, the model outcomes help to understand the effect of the hydrogeological layering on the propagation of the tidal fluctuation and salt concentration into the shallow brackish aquifers underlying the lagoon bottom...|$|R

25|$|By {{the year}} 600, there were major build ups of silt {{on the bottom}} of the Hong Gou canal, obstructing river barges whose drafts were too deep for its waters. The chief {{engineer}} of the Sui dynasty, Yuwen Kai, advised the <b>dredging</b> of <b>a</b> new <b>canal</b> that would run parallel to the existing canal, diverging from it at Chenliu (Yanzhou). The new canal was to pass not Xuzhou but Suzhou, to avoid connecting with the Si River, and instead make a direct connection with the Huai River just west of Lake Hongze. With the recorded labor of five million men and women under the supervision of Ma Shumou, the first major section of the Grand Canal was completed in the year 605—called the Bian Qu. The Grand Canal was fully completed under the second Sui emperor, from the years 604 to 609, first by linking Luoyang to the Yangzhou (and the Yangzi valley), then expanding it to Hangzhou (south), and to Beijing (north). This allowed the southern area to provide grain to the northern province, particularly to troops stationed there. Running alongside and parallel to the <b>canal</b> was <b>an</b> imperial roadway and post offices supporting a courier system. The government also planted an enormous line of trees. The history of the canal's construction is handed down in the book Kaiheji ('Record of the Opening of the Canal').|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Dredging and {{disposal}} of sediments onto agricultural soils is a common practice in industrial and urban areas that can be hazardous to the environment when the sediments contain heavy metals. This chemical hazard can be assessed by evaluating the mobility and speciation of metals after sediment deposition. In this study, the speciation of Zn in the coarse (500 to 2000 m) and fine (2 m) fractions of <b>a</b> contaminated sediment <b>dredged</b> from <b>a</b> ship <b>canal</b> in northern France and deposited on an agricultural soil was determined by physical analytical techniques on raw and chemically treated samples. Zn partitioning between coexisting mineral phases and its chemical associations were first determined by micro-particle-induced X-ray emission and micro-synchrotron-based X-ray radiation fluorescence. Zn-containing mineral species were then identified by X-ray diffraction and powder and polarized extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). The number, nature, and proportion of Zn species were obtained by a coupled principal component analysis (PCA) and least squares fitting (LSF) procedure, applied herein {{for the first time}} to qualitatively (number and nature of species) and quantitatively (relative proportion of species) speciate a metal in a natural system. The coarse fraction consists of slag grains originating from nearby Zn smelters.

Three seagrasses were collected in the study area; Zostera capricorni Aschers., Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook. f. and Halophila spinulosa (R. Br.) Aschers. All seagrasses were found less than 700 m offshore. The biomass of Z. capricorni, the numerically dominant seagrass, was significantly lower in the access channel border compared with the control area before dredging, which was attributed to direct or indirect effects associated with the channel. There was no significant effect of maintenance dredging statistically detected for Z. capricorni biomass in the access channel border even though seagrass was absent in the access channel 14 months after dredging. This {{was due to the}} high background variability of seagrass biomass in the control area.
