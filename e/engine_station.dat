50|$|Every {{station in}} the county has either a {{frontline}} or reserve fire <b>engine.</b> <b>Stations</b> in more rural areas also have either a type 3 engine and/or a patrol (which is usually a type 6 engine). The county also has multiple trucks {{and at least one}} quint.|$|R
50|$|The {{city has}} four fire {{stations}} {{spread throughout the}} city. Station 1 has the paramedic quint ladder truck as its first out unit, the remaining stations have engine companies as their first out unit. Fire station 4 cross staffs a type 3 fire <b>engine.</b> <b>Station</b> 1 was constructed in 1996, replacing a seismically unsafe facility {{at the corner of}} Garden and Pismo. The previous station was sold to a local developer and retrofitted for use as an office. Stations 2 was built in the 1950's, station 3 was built in the 1960's, and station 4 was built in 1978.|$|E
50|$|General Electric's GE36 Unducted Fan was a {{variation}} on the original propfan concept, and appears similar to a pusher configuration piston engine. GE's UDF had a novel direct-drive arrangement, where the reduction gearbox was replaced by a low-speed seven-stage free turbine. One set of turbine rotors drove the forward set of propellers, while the rear set was driven by the other set of rotors which rotated in the opposite direction. The turbine had 14 blade rows with seven stages. Each stage was a pair of contra-rotating rows. Boeing intended to offer GE's pusher UDF engine on the 7J7 platform, and McDonnell Douglas was going to do likewise on their MD-94X airliner. The GE36 was first flight tested mounted on the #3 <b>engine</b> <b>station</b> of a Boeing 727-100 in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|Locomotive, {{written by}} Floca, is a nonfiction book of 64 pages that teaches readers {{about the history}} of the first transcontinental {{railroad}} and locomotive of U.S in the 19th century. The illustrations by Floca follow the history, and the train, <b>engine,</b> <b>station,</b> countries, and people are shown as it was in the 19th century. Through the lines of the book, words are repeated and lines rhyme: [...] "here is how this road was built, with grunt and a heave and a swing, with the ring of shovels on stone, the ring of hammers on spikes," [...] and [...] "Wheels spinning, rods swinging." [...] Similes are used to describe places: [...] "The country opens, opens wide, empty as an ocean." [...] And at the end, the book closes by using assonance: [...] "here where you needed to go, here where you need to be...here with the people you’ve waited and wanted and needed to see." ...|$|E

40|$|An N+ 3 {{technology}} level engine, {{suitable as}} a propulsion system for an advanced single-aisle transport, was {{developed as a}} reference cycle for use in technology assessment and decision-making efforts. This reference engine serves three main purposes: it provides thermodynamic quantities at each major <b>engine</b> <b>station,</b> it provides overall propulsion system performance data for vehicle designers to use in their analyses, {{and it can be}} used for comparison against other proposed N+ 3 technology-level propulsion systems on an equal basis. This reference cycle is meant to represent the expected capability of gas turbine engines in the N+ 3 timeframe given reasonable extrapolations of technology improvements and the ability {{to take full advantage of}} those improvements...|$|E
50|$|Every year, on Good Friday, the Directors would organise an orchestral {{concert in}} Barry and arrange a special train from Trehafod {{to carry the}} company’s {{employees}} and their families to the concert. As the “K Class” was vacuum fitted, {{they were the only}} <b>engines</b> <b>stationed</b> at Hafod shed suitably equipped to haul a passenger train. This tradition took place in the early 1900s.|$|R
40|$|A crash-fire {{protection}} system is described which will suppress the ignition of crash-spilled fuel {{that may be}} ingested by a T- 56 turbo-propeller engine. This system includes means for rapidly extinguishing the combustor flame, means for cooling and inerting with water the hot engine parts likely to ignite engine ingested fuel, and means for blanketing with bromotrifluoromethane massive metal parts that may reheat after the engine stops rotating. Combustion-chamber flames were rapidly extinguished at the engine fuel nozzles by a fuel shutoff and drain valve. Hot engine parts were inerted and cooled by 42 pounds of water discharged at seven <b>engine</b> <b>stations.</b> Massive metal parts that could reheat were inerted with 10 pounds of bromotrifluoromethane discharged at two <b>engine</b> <b>stations.</b> Performance trials of the crash-fire {{protection system}} were conducted by bringing the engine up to takeoff temperature, actuating the crash-fire protection system, and then spraying fuel into the engine to simulate crash-ingested fuel. No fires occurred during these trials, although fuel was sprayed into the engine from 0. 3 second to 15 minutes after actuating the crash-fire protection system...|$|R

40|$|The data {{reduction}} program {{used to analyze}} the performance of the Aerothermodynamic Integration Model is described.

Various subroutines were modified and used to obtain species concentrations and transport properties in chemical equilibrium at each of the internal and external <b>engine</b> <b>stations.</b> It is recommended that future test plans include the configuration, calibration, and channel assignment data on a magnetic tape generated at the test site immediately before or after a test, and that the {{data reduction}} program be designed to operate in a batch environment...|$|R
