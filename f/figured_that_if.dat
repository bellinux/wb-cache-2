25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In {{his rookie}} year, Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games {{at second base}} and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone, the two {{encouraging}} each other. [...] "And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. We <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league.|$|E
500|$|Despite Kemp's {{return from}} injury {{and the arrival}} of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only {{compiled}} a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, [...] "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ...I <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress." ...|$|E

[...] inquired Thurston, and Bransome answered frankly: [...] "Well, just then I had my doubts about you; now I <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you say you}} can do a thing, you can. Come over to the ranch, and, if we can't make a deal, I'll give you a week's work, any way." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Figuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{they can}} get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, {{they can get}} their dog back, the Simpsons seek Duffman, who has become an {{ordinary}} man named Barry Duffman who helps the less fortunate (by teaching math at a local halfway house). The Simpsons ask him to help the family get Santa's Little Helper back at a Duff Beer-sponsored beach volleyball event.|$|R
50|$|Macavoy {{identifies}} the other remaining suspect as the Man in the Suit, but Donnelly gets {{a message and}} realizes that someone got to Macavoy - he tells Carter that Kelly apparently hung himself and observes how Macavoy appears to be too nervous {{to tell the truth}} and <b>figures</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he is pointing to one suspect, the other suspect, Reese, must be the man.|$|R
500|$|The Association {{had turned}} to the Scott Stamp and Coin Company of New York to market the coins. [...] Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. These actions have been {{interpreted}} negatively by numismatic scholars: Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity, and that the company [...] "desired {{to capitalize on the}} gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the Century of Progress Exposition held that year in Chicago." [...] Swiatek and Breen noted, [...] "through God only knows what manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" [...] for sale at the exposition.|$|E
2500|$|After art school, {{he showed}} a {{portfolio}} of his work to DC Comics' art director Vince Colletta, which led to his entering the comics field at age 19. The artist recalled in 1985, [...] "They didn't have any work for me, but that didn't bother me. I just <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> comics didn't work out I'd have done advertising or illustration. Vinnie called [...] Neal Adams, who put me in touch with [...] Jim Shooter. Soon after that I was drawing Moon Knight, in The Hulk [...] magazine". His art style was heavily influenced by Neal Adams.|$|E
2500|$|Looking {{for better}} {{distribution}} of their records, Big Black negotiated {{a deal with}} Homestead Records. Gerard Cosloy, who had befriended Albini through writing for Matter and gone on to work at Homestead, negotiated an unorthodox deal for the band: Big Black merely licensed their recordings to Homestead for specific lengths of time, rather than the label retaining {{the rights to the}} recordings as was typical. Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that [...] "We came from a punk perspective — {{we did not want to}} get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their word. We had ideals, and that was one of our ideals." [...] The band members <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a record company were going to cheat them, they would be able to do so with or without a contract because the band couldn't afford to defend themselves.|$|E
5000|$|White Sox owner Bill Veeck tried a new {{philosophy}} {{during the}} offseason: <b>figuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he could not}} compete with the bigger spending clubs for free agents, he would [...] "rent" [...] them, even if only for one year. With this strategy in mind, he traded for Richie Zisk (who had one year remaining on his contract) and Oscar Gamble (also in {{the final year of}} his contract), hoping that {{he would be able to}} continue the practice financially.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} an egg is {{approximated}} by [...] "long" [...] half of a prolate spheroid, joined to a [...] "short" [...] half of a roughly spherical ellipsoid, or even a slightly oblate spheroid. These are joined at the equator and sharing a principal axis of rotational symmetry, as illustrated above. Although the term egg-shaped usually implies a lack of reflection symmetry across the equatorial plane, it may also refer to true prolate ellipsoids. It {{can also be used}} to describe the 2-dimensional <b>figure</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> revolved around its major axis, produces the 3-dimensional surface.|$|R

He looks at {{every kind of}} number {{you can think of}} - real, imaginary, rational, irrational, positive and negative - along with several you might have thought you couldn't think of. He explains the insights of the ancient mathematicians, shows how numbers have evolved through the ages, and reveals the way numerical theory enables everyday life. Under Professor Stewart's guidance you will discover the mathematics of codes...|$|R
2500|$|Australian {{hopes that}} they could set England a good target {{received}} an immediate double blow as Alec Bedser sent Morris and Burke straight back to the pavilion. Lindsay Hassett and Neil Harvey salvaged a stand of 81 from the wreckage of 6/2, with Harvey swashbuckling his way to 52 in what Bill O'Reilly thought was his best innings of the series. He was torpedoed by a shooter from Doug Wright (3/56) and Freddie Brown (1/32) caught and bowled Keith Miller for a duck to leave them 89/4. Hassett found another partner in Graeme Hole and saw out the day at 129/4, but was skittled {{in the morning for}} 48 – Doug Wright's 100th test wicket – when a leg-spinner zipped one past his bat and toppled his off-stump. Wright finally showed why he was so feared on the county circuit when Ian Johnson lofted a googly to Brown at mid-off. Australia were now 142/6, a mere 39 runs ahead, but Hole stood steady for three hours making 63 until he was bowled by Trevor Bailey (1/32). Brown <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> anybody deserved some easy wickets it was Bedser and the big Surrey bowler removed Lindwall, Johnston and Iverson for five runs and ending his superb tour with 5/59, [...] 10/105 in the match. His 30 wickets (16.06) was the most by an English bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic idea}} for the 2D/3D {{aesthetic}} really just started with the Trixel idea.

5000|$|Television {{broadcasts}} featuring Nelson were {{notable for}} his multi-colored [...] sports jackets. He reportedly owned 335 {{of them at}} one time. During a broadcast, his jackets often clashed with the set and produced a scintillation effect in the broadcast image. But he <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> fans could see rather than just hear broadcasts, {{he might as well}} give them something interesting to talk about.|$|E
5000|$|The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization. A gravely injured hermit {{comes to}} Trurl's house and tells Trurl of Klapaucius's adventure: Klapaucius wanders across an old robot, who {{tells him that}} he has logically deduced the {{existence}} of a civilization that reached the highest possible level of development (hence [...] "HPLD"). He has inferred the existence of such a civilization by <b>figuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there are different stages of development, there will be one that is the highest. He was then faced with a problem of identifying that one; as he noted, everyone claimed that theirs was the HPLD.|$|R
2500|$|In 22, with {{virtually}} the entire empire rebelling against Wang Mang's incompetent rule, Liu Yan prepared his rebellion. [...] He planned, along with his brothers, and Li Tong (李通) and his cousin Li Yi (李軼), to kidnap the governor for Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan) and call {{for the people of}} the commandery to join him. [...] When the young men of their home territory of Chongling heard about the rebellion, they were all scared to join—until they saw that Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion as well, <b>figuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> even a careful man like Liu Xiu was part of the rebellion, the rebellion was carefully planned.|$|R

But I {{want you to know that}} I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody.

50|$|The {{first to}} propose {{what is now}} the most {{pervasive}} hypothesis on how sympatric speciation may occur was John Maynard-Smith. He {{came up with the idea}} of disruptive selection. He <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> two ecological niches are occupied by a single species, diverging selection between the two niches could eventually cause reproductive isolation. By adapting to have the highest possible fitness in the distinct niches, two species may emerge from one even if they remain in the same area, and even if they are mating randomly.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} the All-Stars came to Ollie Kraehe {{while he was still}} a {{substitute}} offensive lineman playing for the Rock Island Independents. Kraehe <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> small towns markets, like Green Bay and Rock Island, could be successful operating a professional football team, then operating in a larger market like St. Louis would bring in even more income. He was a local football hero in St. Louis since he had played college football at Washington University in St. Louis alongside Jimmy Conzelman and had captained the 1921 team.|$|E

As Wild has described, {{during his time}} working in museums and archives: [...] "there were some objects and {{pictures}} I saw that for me had an enormous and seemingly untapped power - a power to disrupt our sense of time, to dissolve the barrier between present and past. I <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I could harness that power, I {{might be able to}} build something akin to a time-machine. Hence Retronaut." ...|$|E
