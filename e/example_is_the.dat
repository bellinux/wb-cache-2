5|$|Batesian mimicry, {{where an}} edible species resembles a distasteful or {{dangerous}} species. This is {{most common in}} insects such as butterflies. A familiar <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> resemblance of harmless hoverflies (which have no sting) to bees.|$|E
5|$|Black swans feature as emblems and decorations on most {{important}} public buildings in Western Australia. An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{tower of the}} Fremantle Town Hall.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} medieval {{fortified}} churches, monasteries and cathedrals survive in Portugal. These buildings were built either in Romanesque or Gothic styles. Romanesque <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Lisbon Cathedral and the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. Gothic <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Church of Leça do Balio and the Guarda Cathedral.|$|R

5|$|Many of the twenty-two {{countries}} {{listed here}} typically {{have had a}} long-standing agreement with a former occupying country; one <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> agreement between Monaco and France, which has existed for at least 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{can be a}} {{powerful}} vehicle for satire. The Romans had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for political purposes. A notable <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Roman poet Juvenal's satires.|$|E
5|$|The Hassi R'Mel {{power station}} in Algeria, {{is an example}} of {{combining}} CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-parabolic trough array supplements a much larger 130MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Yazd power station in Iran.|$|E

5|$|A {{more mundane}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice {{and with the}} historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bipartite double cover, {{formed from}} a graph by {{splitting}} each vertex v into v0 and v1 and replacing each edge u,v with edges u0,v1 and v0,u1. The function mapping v0 and v1 in the cover to v {{in the original}} graph is a homomorphism and a covering map.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Asociación Acueducto de Río Negro de Popayán, {{which was}} formed 10years ago {{integrating}} 10 supply systems, supplying 7,000 residential connections. The association is preparing its own {{water treatment plant}} and preparing to install meters {{with the aid of}} the Colombian organization Asociados en Desarrollo Rural (ADR) or Associates in Rural Development and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{at-grade}} intersections (level junctions) have posted numbers; former <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Taconic State Parkway, NY 17, {{and within}} New York City, NY 27 along only {{the section of}} Linden Boulevard east of Kings Highway. Current <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Bronx River Parkway and, within New York City, NY 27 along Conduit Avenue only.|$|R

5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Great Vowel Shift in English, {{which is}} the reason that the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance {{prohibits the}} removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> development of wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to official shelters, many people offer their homes, places of business, or inns to accommodate AT hikers. One <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Little Lyford Pond camps {{maintained by the}} Appalachian Mountain Club. Inns are more common in sections of the trail that coincide with national parks, most notably Virginia's Shenandoah National Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the visual representations of the institution, the university's individual departments, faculties, and schools also employ symbols to visually represent them. One such <b>example</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Faculty of Engineering's fireball emblem, adopted by the faculty in 1960. The fireball was adopted from the coat of arms of the defunct Hamilton College.|$|E
