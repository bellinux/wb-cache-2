50|$|These are rotors spun at {{constant}} speed, {{mounted on}} gimbals to provide attitude control. Although a CMG provides control {{about the two}} axes orthogonal to the <b>gyro</b> <b>spin</b> axis, triaxial control still requires two units. A CMG {{is a bit more}} expensive in terms of cost and mass, because gimbals and their drive motors must be provided. The maximum torque (but not the maximum angular momentum change) exerted by a CMG is greater than for a momentum wheel, making it better suited to large spacecraft. A major drawback is the additional complexity, which increases the number of failure points. For this reason, the International Space Station uses a set of four CMGs to provide dual failure tolerance.|$|R
50|$|It {{is based}} on a {{gyroscope}} that erects so its spin axis is vertical. The housing for the gyro rotor rotates at a low speed, on the order of 18 rpm. On opposite sides of the housing are two small tanks, partially filled with mercury, and connected by a capillary tube. Mercury flows to the lower tank, but slowly (several seconds) because of the tube's restriction. If the <b>gyro's</b> <b>spin</b> axis is not vertical, the added weight in the lower tank would pull the housing over {{if it were not for}} the gyro and the housing's rotation. That rotational speed and rate of mercury flow combine to put the heavier tank in the best position to make the gyro precess toward the vertical.|$|R

Electricity is carried to the motor by thin wires (approximately {{the size of a}} human hair). It is believed that oxygen in the pressurized air used during the assembly process caused the wires to corrode and break. The new gyros were assembled using nitrogen instead of oxygen. Each gyroscope is packaged in a Rate Sensor assembly. The Rate Sensors are packaged in pairs into an assembly called a Rate Sensor Unit (RSU). It is the RSUs that the STS-103's astronauts changed. The RSUs each weigh 11.0 kg and are 12.8 by 10.5 by 8.9 inches (325 by 267 by 226 mm) in size.|$|R

The leveling of the platform is {{taken over by the}} X and Y accelerometers sensing even the smallest component of gravity which is an indication of not being precisely level. The leveling of the stable element is achieved by torqueing the respective gyro torquers which makes the gimbal motors to follow up and level the stable element. The distance shafts are set to zero; the gyros are at operational speed and the computer is continuously feeding the gyros, and thereby the stable element, with corrections for local earth rotation. This is called the leveling phase of fine align.|$|R

The flight conditions investigated included landing at sea level, approach condition at 12, 000 feet, and cruising at 50, 000 feet at Mach numbers of 0. 80 and 1. 2. The results of the investigation indicated that the lateral stability characteristics of the D- 558 -II airplane for the flight condition discussed should satisfy the Air Force - Navy period-damping criterion when the proposed autopilot is installed.

Compliances to determine isoelasticity conditions, G-capabilities and buckling critical stress were calculated using finite element techniques and classical mechanics. The minimum G-capabilitiy was computed to be 261 G's (32. 6 gram rotor) along the z or <b>gyro</b> <b>spin</b> axis. With the force due to the rotor in the +z direction the flexures would fail in buckling, the critical stress being 154, 260 psi.

Two gyros {{stabilize}} the stable platform {{and provide for}} various compensations to be introduced, keeping the stable platform level with respect to earth instead of inertial space, and providing a coordinate reference system of three axes. The gyros each have two degrees of freedom, and are oriented so that the spin axes are 90 degrees apart. The upper <b>gyro</b> has its <b>spin</b> axis oriented along the north-south grid coordinate axis and is sensitive to torques (airplane rotations) about the east-west and vertical coordinate axes. The lower <b>gyro</b> has its <b>spin</b> axis oriented along the east-west grid axis and is sensitive to torques about the north-south and vertical axes. Therefore the two gyros control all three axes.|$|R

50|$|After {{the high}} degree of success {{achieved}} in 1962, the flight record of the D-series took {{a turn for the worse}} in 1963. The first flight of the year, Missile 39D, went awry when high thrust section temperatures caused total propulsion system failure two minutes into launch. The malfunction was traced to the sustainer insulation boot breaking off at liftoff, which allowed exhaust gases to recirculate in the thrust section. Three Atlas Ds then successfully tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On March 10, Atlas 102D was launched on an operational test from 576-B3. The missile began to tumble out of control shortly after liftoff and self-destructed at T+33 seconds, showering the area around the pad with flaming debris. Investigation of the failure found that the pitch <b>gyro</b> <b>spin</b> motor was either not running or the rotation speed was too low, and that 102D was still using the old Type B gyro canisters which did not have the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System (SMRD). The SMRD had been conceived back in 1958 after the first Atlas B failed in flight due to an inoperative yaw gyro, but was not phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961. Missile 102D had not been upgraded to the newer Type D gyros which had the SMRD, and a quick examination of the Atlas inventory at VAFB found two more missiles with Type B gyros. They were replaced with spare Type D canisters from Project Mercury.|$|R

40|$|GPS {{was used}} with a short {{baseline}} (1 and 2 wavelengths) triple antenna configuration to obtain attitude in conjunction with solid state rate gyros. The system was used to provide an inexpensive Attitude-Heading Reference System (AHRS) for use by small General Aviation aircraft. The gyros enabled a high bandwidth output while the GPS was used to estimate the gyro drift rate. The resulting attitude information was used, along with GPS-based position, by a graphical "out-thewindow " view with tunnels indicating the desired path in the sky for the current phase of flight. Accuracy and ease of flying are enhanced by the system. I.

Direct game mode is a feature used {{to learn how to use}} R.O.B. or to play with R.O.B. without playing the game. Gyromite is a puzzle-platformer in which the character has to collect dynamite before the time runs out, with several red and blue pillars blocking his way. In Game A, the commands are made by pressing START and then pushing the direction in which to move R.O.B., and using the A and B buttons to open and close his arms. If R.O.B. places a gyro on the red or blue button, it pushes the A or B button on the second NES controller, moving the pillar of the corresponding color. If both buttons need to be pressed at the same time, the gyros are placed in a spinner so that they will stay balanced on the button without R.O.B. holding it. Game B has the same controls, except that START does not need to be pressed to make R.O.B. accept a command.|$|R
5000|$|San Luis {{attacked}} {{again on}} the night of 10 May. The frigate [...] had made passage up Falkland Sound, sinking an Argentine merchant navy ship on the way. As Alacrity left the channel before dawn, sister ship [...] was waiting to accompany her back to the Task Force. San Luis detected the two ships and fired two SST-4 torpedoes, one of which did not leave its tube; the other was apparently defeated by Arrows anti-torpedo measures. There were several problems with torpedoes and torpedo systems; in particular it appears that the torpedoes were not prepared properly, and did not arm themselves after firing, so would not explode even if they did hit a target. It has been suggested that previous apparent misses could have been due to torpedoes which struck home but did not explode. After the Falklands War ended, German and Dutch engineers were sent to Argentina to discover what went wrong with their torpedoes. The problem was found to be that one of the Argentine sailors {{who was in charge of}} periodic maintenance of the torpedoes had inadvertently reversed the polarity of power cables between the torpedoes and the submarine. This meant that when the torpedoes' <b>gyros</b> were <b>spun</b> up, they ran [...] "backwards" [...] and thus tumbled on launch, preventing the weapons from taking up their proper heading.|$|R

40|$|The superconducting readout {{system to}} be used for resolving 0. 001 arcsec changes in the {{gyroscope}} spin direction in the Relativity Gyroscope (GP-B) experiment is described. This system couples the London magnetic moment flux of the <b>spinning</b> <b>gyro</b> to a low noise superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) detector. Resolution limits and noise performance of the detection system are discussed, and improvements obtained and expected with advanced SQUIDs are presented. Also described is the novel use of superconducting magnetic shielding techniques to obtain a 250 dB attenuation of the earth's magnetic field at the location of the gyroscopes. In this approach, expanded superconducting foil shields are coupled with fixed cylindrical superconducting shields and special geometric considerations to obtain the extremely high attenuation factor required. With these shielding techniques, it appears that the 0. 5 -Gauss earth field (which appears to the gyroscopes as an ac field at the satellite roll rate) can be reduced to the 10 to the - 13 th G level required by the experiment.
