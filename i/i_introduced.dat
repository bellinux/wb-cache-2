5|$|Achaemenid ruler Cyrus the Great conquered Sogdiana while {{campaigning in}} Central Asia in 546–539 BC, a fact {{mentioned}} {{by the ancient}} Greek historian Herodotus in his Histories. Darius <b>I</b> <b>introduced</b> the Aramaic writing system and coin currency to Central Asia, in addition to incorporating Sogdians into his standing army as regular soldiers and cavalrymen. A contingent of Sogdian soldiers fought in the main army of Xerxes I during his ultimately failed invasion of Greece in 480 BC. A Persian inscription from Susa claims that the palace there was adorned with lapis lazuli and carnelian originating from Sogdiana.|$|E

Aerial combat became a prominent feature with the Fokker Scourge, {{in the last half}} of 1915. This was also the beginning of a long-standing trend in warfare, showing statistically that approximately five percent of combat pilots account for the majority of air-to-air victories.|$|E

25|$|Strategic bombing during World War <b>I</b> <b>introduced</b> {{air attacks}} {{intended}} to panic civilian targets and led in 1918 to the amalgamation of British army and navy air services into the Royal Air Force. Its first Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard {{was among the}} military strategists in the 1920s like Giulio Douhet who saw air warfare as {{a new way to}} overcome the stalemate of trench warfare. Interception was nearly impossible with fighter planes no faster than bombers. Their view (expressed vividly in 1932) was that the bomber will always get through, and the only defence was a deterrent bomber force capable of matching retaliation. Predictions were made that a bomber offensive would quickly cause thousands of deaths and civilian hysteria leading to capitulation, but widespread pacifism contributed to a reluctance to provide resources.|$|E

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of the loyalist party, with their leaders {{consequently}} exiled in Portugal or dead abroad, king Henry II and John <b>I</b> <b>introduced</b> a series of foreign noble houses in Galicia as tenants of important fiefs. The important County of Trastámara, ancient dominions of the Traba and Castro houses, was given first to Pedro Eníquez de Castro, nephew of King Henry II; later, in 1440 it was divided in the two counties of Trastamara and Lemos, and given to the Osorio house of the frontier lands of Bierzo. In the South some important concession was given to the Sarmento family, which on time would possess the job of Adelantado Mayor of the Kingdom of Galicia as a family legacy; and to the Pimentel of Benavente. Some of these families, most notably the Osorio as Counts of Lemos, would become during the 16th and 17th centuries the most influential defenders of any Galician cause. But during the 15th century, {{in the absence of a}} solid leadership as those exercised in the past by the archbishop of Santiago or by the Counts of Trastámara, the Kingdom of Galicia was reduced to a set of semi-independent and rival fiefdoms, militarily important, but with little political influence abroad.|$|E

500|$|Harihara (or Harisvara, 1160), {{who came}} {{from a family of}} karnikas (accountants) in Hampi, was one of the {{earliest}} Veerashaiva writers who {{was not part of the}} Vachana poetic tradition. He is considered one of the most influential Kannada poets of the Hoysala era. A non-traditionalist, he has been called [...] "poet of poets" [...] and a [...] "poet for the masses". Kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts, and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow. Impressed by his early writings, Kereya Padmarasa, the court poet of King Narasimha <b>I,</b> <b>introduced</b> him to the king, who became Harihara's patron. A master of many metres, he authored the Girijakalyana ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess – Parvati") in the Kalidasa tradition, employing the champu style to tell a 10-part story leading to the marriage of the god Shiva and Parvati. According to an anecdote, Harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his protégé Raghavanka for writing about King Harishchandra in the landmark work Harishchandra Kavya (c.1200). Harihara is credited with developing the native ragale metre. The earliest poetic biographer in the Kannada language, he wrote a biography of Basavanna called Basavarajadevara ragale, which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time. Ascribed to him is a group of 100poems called the Nambiyanana ragale (also called Shivaganada ragale or Saranacharitamanasa – [...] "The holy lake of the lives of the devotees") after the saint Nambiyana. In the sataka metre he wrote the Pampa sataka, and in the ashtaka metre, the Mudige ashtaka in about 1200.|$|E
