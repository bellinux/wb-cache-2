5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for <b>food,</b> <b>groups</b> will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation of}} the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within pair bonds by targeting different foods so {{that everyone in the}} household benefits. Females may target foods that do not conflict with reproduction and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which will reduce variance in daily consumption and provide a broader diet for the family. Foraging specialization in particular <b>food</b> <b>groups</b> should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods.|$|E
25|$|Eating a {{balanced}} diet {{with a range of}} foods from different <b>food</b> <b>groups</b> {{is the best way to}} avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, millet, tuber, or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate.|$|E

25|$|Pharaoh ants have a {{sophisticated}} strategy for food preference. They implement two related behaviors. The first {{is known as}} satiation. The workers will at first show a strong preference for a particular food type. However, if this food is offered alone, with no other options, for several weeks, workers will afterward show a distinct preference for {{a different type of}} food. In this way, the ants become satiated on a certain food group and will change their decision. The second behavior is called alternation. If given the continuous choice between <b>food</b> <b>groups,</b> pharaoh ants will tend to alternate between carbohydrate-rich foods and protein-rich foods. These satiation and alternation behaviors are evolutionarily adaptive. The decision to vary the type of food consumed ensures that the colony maintains a balanced diet.|$|E
500|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, sugar is an {{important}} part of the human diet, making food more palatable and providing food energy. After cereals and vegetable oils, sugar derived from sugarcane and beet provided more kilocalories per capita per day on average than other <b>food</b> <b>groups.</b> According to the FAO, an average of [...] of sugar, equivalent to over 260 food calories per day, was consumed annually per person of all ages in the world in 1999.

2500|$|Aboriginal Australians {{have eaten}} native {{animal and plant}} foods for an {{estimated}} 60,000 years of human habitation on the Australian continent (see Indigenous Australian <b>food</b> <b>groups,</b> Australian Aboriginal sweet foods). Various traditional methods of processing and cooking are used. Toxic seeds, such as Cycas media and Moreton Bay chestnut, are processed to remove the toxins and render them safe to eat. Many foods are also baked in the hot campfire coals, or baked for several hours in ground ovens. [...] "Paperbark", the bark of Melaleuca species, is widely used for wrapping food placed in ground ovens. Bush bread was made by males using many types of seeds, nuts and corns to process a flour or dough to make bread.|$|E
2500|$|While the Pee-wee Herman {{character}} had not {{originally been}} intended {{for a child}} audience, during the mid-1980s Reubens started forming him into the best role model he possibly could, making of his TV program a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity, the four <b>food</b> <b>groups,</b> and the dangers of making prank calls, but in a manner not overly preachy. Reubens was also careful about what should be associated with Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he {{went to great lengths}} never to be photographed with a cigarette in his mouth.

2500|$|... is an EPA dietary {{exposure}} model. The DEPM database system contains numerous national, government-sponsored food intake surveys and chemical residue data from monitoring programs. In this model, consumption {{is expressed in}} terms 11 <b>food</b> <b>groups</b> containing 800 core foods which were selected to allow matching between food consumption and chemical residue data. These 800 core food items were established from mean values of consumption of over 6,700 foods commonly identified in food surveys. This model utilizes per capita food consumption rates for these 800 core foods for {{the population in the}} USA and also for roughly 24 subpopulations defined by different demographic factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity. A critical component of the DEPM model is the recipes which convert food as consumed to the raw agricultural commodities for which the chemical residue data is collected. The residue database contains average values of residues for more than 350 pesticides and environmental contaminants.|$|E
2500|$|Following Alex & Amanda's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Words of Love" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in heats; the men went first, and were {{followed}} by the women. The HouseGuests were asked questions about the various quotes hanging {{on the walls of}} the house. If a HouseGuest answered a question correctly, they would eliminate one HouseGuest from the competition; the man and woman who won each round would then face off in the final round, with the winner earning both them and their partner the title of Head of Household for the week. Joshuah & Sharon were the winners. Shortly following their win, Joshuah and Allison engaged in numerous verbal arguments due to Joshuah being mad at Allison for changing her vote last minute, as well as the lesbian lie she had told earlier in the game. Due to these arguments, Allison debated quitting the game, though was later convinced in the Diary Room to stay; she did, however, have a restraining order placed on Joshuah, and he was forbidden to be within five feet of her. On Day 22, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Big Aspara-Guess!" [...] food competition. For this competition, the men were required to guess the weight of their partners and then gather enough asparagus to weigh the same amount. If they got within ten pounds of their partner's weight, the HouseGuests won the two major <b>food</b> <b>groups</b> that couple represented. Later that day, Joshuah & Sharon chose to nominate Allison & Ryan and Matt & Natalie for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Adam & Sheila were selected to compete; James was selected to host. On Day 23, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Cupid is as Cupid Does" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the couples were required to solve a puzzle by lifting the women into the air through a harness, while the men ran the puzzle pieces to them. Matt & Natalie were the winners of the Power of Veto. On Day 24, the HouseGuests learned that sometime in the coming weeks an alarm would go off in the house, and this meant that a twist would occur. On Day 25, Matt & Natalie chose to use the Power of Veto to remove themselves from the block, with Adam & Sheila being nominated in their place. On Day 28, Allison and Ryan were announced as the fourth couple to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of two to zero. Before they could exit the house, however, the alarm went off, and the HouseGuests learned that they were officially playing the game as individuals. The HouseGuests then learned that they would be voting to evict either Allison or Ryan from the house, rather than the both of them being evicted. Allison then became the first individual HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero.|$|E
