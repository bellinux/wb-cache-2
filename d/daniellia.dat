5000|$|Gum copal, {{also known}} as manila copal, is a resin {{produced}} by the sap of the forest tree (<b>Daniellia</b> sp.), due to common impurities and differences in regions, gum copal ranges in colors from blacks to yellows to whites. Gum copal, along with ivory and slaves, was a significant export from East Africa in the nineteenth century. Gum copal exists in a state {{very similar to that}} of amber but with some primary differences. It is commonly mistaken for amber and oftentimes sold at gem shows or other areas as amber. Unlike amber, gum copal is usually only 100-1,000 years old and it has not yet fossilized. [...] Gum copal usually sells for $750-$1500 USD per metric ton in rock form and $1500-$6500 USD Per metric ton in powder form.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{ecological}} {{characteristics and}} climatic conditions, {{the country is}} divided under three bio-climatic zones namely, the Sahelian Zone, the Sudanian Zone and the Sudano-Guinean Zone. The Sahelian Zone covers 25% of {{the area of the}} northern part of the country,which is further sub divided under the Sahelian and sub-Sahelian sectors. In the Sahelian sector, where the rainfall is only of the order of 400 mm, the vegetation is mostly of shrubs and wooded grassland or steppe. The sub-Sahelian sector represents the transition zone, receives an average annual rainfall of 400 - 600 mm and represents the transition between the Sahelian and Sudanian bioclimatic zones. The vegetation in this sector has moist Sudan savanna vegetation in the river valleys, while the western half is largely inhabited by humans; most of the large trees in the northern half of the sector are reported to have vanished due to climate change. The Sudan Zone receives higher rainfall in the range of 600 - 1000 mm and is further subdivided into three sectors namely, the central plateau sector, the Mouhoun sector and the Pendjari-Mékrou sector and has widely varying vegetation depending on human occupation for agriculture and mostly savanna vegetation, predominantly wooded savanna. the Pendjari-Mékrou sector with its flood plains and many ephemeral rivers, is less populated by humans but has largest population of mammals in the country; vultures and raptors are also reported. The Sudano-Guinean Zone in the south-west corner of the country, is a humid zone with an annual rainfall in the range of 1000 - 1200 mm. It is heavily wooded with wooded savannas and gallery forests; it has the ambiance of a park with its widespread vegetation of Khaya senegalensis, <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri and Isoberlin forests, tall grasses and savanna vegetation is also a dominant feature. Its human population distribution is low but the wild life population is the second largest in the country.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} ad libitum feeding of foliages of Afzelia africana, <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri and Entada africana supplemented with concentrate in twenty-four intact growing bucks (6 mo old, live weight (LW) 7. 30 ± 0. 1 kg). Goats were divided into three equal groups of similar LW in a complete randomized design. Intakes of forage, dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), nitrogen, organic matter (OM) and digestible crude protein (DCP), average daily gain, digestibilities of DM and CP, DCP, N retention, ruminal fluid acetate, and serum urea N, albumin and globulin were greater (P< 0. 05; 0. 01) in Afzelia or <b>Daniellia</b> vs. Entada. Digestible energy (DE) to DCP ratio was lower (P< 0. 01) in Afzelia or <b>Daniellia</b> vs. Entada and in Afzelia vs. <b>Daniellia.</b> Digestibility of OM, digestible OM, energy, microbial protein synthesis, ruminal volatile fatty acids and serum total protein were superior (P< 0. 05) in Afzelia vs. Entada and in <b>Daniellia</b> vs. Entada (P< 0. 01). Digestibility of fibre fractions and ruminal NH 3 -N was lower (P< 0. 05; 0. 01) for Entada relative to Afzelia and <b>Daniellia.</b> Whereas ruminal fluid propionate was higher (P< 0. 05; 0. 01) for <b>Daniellia</b> compared to Afzelia or Entada, the acetate to propionate ratio was lower (P< 0. 05; 0. 01) in <b>Daniellia</b> than in Afzelia or Entada. Methane production was higher (P< 0. 05) for Afzelia than for <b>Daniellia</b> or Entada. Serum glucose was greater in <b>Daniellia</b> than Afzelia (P< 0. 05), in Afzelia than Entada (P< 0. 05) and in <b>Daniellia</b> than Entada (P< 0. 01). Results suggest <b>Daniellia</b> as an alternative fodder for Afzelia and indicate higher feeding value of Afzelia and <b>Daniellia</b> for feeding growing goats compared to Entada...|$|E

40|$|International audienceObservations of {{a monkey}} {{community}} {{in a forest}} of the Zaire Basin show that four species intensively lick the nectar of <b>Daniellia</b> pynaertii (Caesalpinoideae) for 5 months of the year; nectar makes up a mean of 20 % and a maximum of 50 % of monthly plant feeding records (Fig. 3). Such intensive nectar-feeding by monkeys of up to 8 kg body weight probably developed in these basically frugivorous primates as an alternative strategy {{to cope with a}} shortage of fleshy fruits. This would have been possible due to the high density of the plant species, the synchrony and abundance of its flowering (Fig. 2), and the large size of the nectar drop and its nutritional value. Patterns of monkey movements among <b>Daniellia</b> trees show that one flowering tree may receive up to 10 species visits and 30 individual visits per day, for a total of up to 141 min. (Table 1). A monkey troop can visit 12 trees in succession over less than 3 h (Fig. 4). This suggests that monkeys are able to promote pollen transfer both among flowers of the same tree and between conspecific trees. The individual tree fruiting index is positively correlated with its flowering index and with the amount of visits by monkeys, indicating at least that monkeys do not inhibit the reproductive ability of flowers (Fig. 5). These results suggest that monkeys can be considered as a guild of effective pollinators. Long-term coevolution between the plant and its present-day pollinators seems unlikely, and we suggest that monkeys replaced other pollinators, such as Lepidoptera. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that tubular flowers adapted for pollination by Lepidoptera are found in affine species of the same genus and of affine genera, the latter being known to be pollinated by these insects. In contrast, D. pynaertii flowers typically meet the pollination syndrome currently defined for attracting large mammals: notably conspicuousness and open morphology of the flowers, nectar colour and abundance. These characteristics suggest that coadaptation between monkeys and plant or at least one-sided adaptation has operated...|$|E
40|$|The {{leaves of}} the plants <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri (Fabaceae) and Ficus sycomorus (Moraceae) used in {{diarrhea}} treatment in Hausa ethnomedicine of Northern Nigeria were investigated. The study was carried out on parfused isolated rabbit jejunum and castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice. The n-butanol extracts: NBD and NBF (0. 16 – 3. 2 mg/ml) caused a dose-dependent relaxation of isolated rabbit jejunum. The acute toxicity test for NBD and NBT in mice established an i. p LD 50 of > 4000 mg/kg for D. oliveri and 1131. 4 mg/kg for F. sycomorus. In castor oil-induced diarrhea, 80 % protection was observed for D. oliveri at doses of 200 mg/kg and 60 % protection was observed at 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg respectively. For F. sycomorus 100 % protection was observed at doses of 120 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, for the n-butanol extract. The antidiarrheal activity was comparable to loperamide 5 mg/kg.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the microbial load on 17 randomly selected plant samples from 60 ethnobotanically collected medicinal plants from five local markets in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. Method: The pour plate method {{was used to}} cultivate serially diluted portions of the medicinal plant samples investigated. Enumeration of bacteria was carried out on nutrient agar (NA) while that of fungi was effected on Sabouraud agar (SA). Results: The identified microbial isolates include 12 bacterial and 6 fungal genera. The mean heterotrophic bacteria counts of the different herbal samples ranged from 1. 3 × 105 cfu/g (Cnestis ferruginea) to 6. 7 × 106 cfu/g (<b>Daniellia</b> oliveri), while total fungal propagule counts ranged from 0. 0 × 101 cfu/g (Terminalia superba, Cola gigantea, Rauwolfia vomitoria, Zingiber officinale and Argemone mexicana) to 7. 1 × 106 cfu/g (Nesogordonia papaverifera). The synopsis and frequency (prevalence rate) of microbial species isolation showed that Bacillus spp. (82. 4 %) and Mucor spp. (47. 1 %) had the highest prevalence rates among bacteria and fungi, respectively.

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} at Bole, Ghana to {{determine}} the incidence and severity of leaf spot of Vitellaria paradoxa (shea), identify the causal pathogen and alternative hosts, and {{assess the impact of}} disease incidence on shea nut yield. Each of 4960 shea trees and surrounding herbs, shrubs or trees were inspected for symptoms of leaf spots. Disease severity was scored on a scale of 0 to 4 on each of 30 leaves randomly sampled from the lower, middle and upper canopy of each of 64 selected trees categorised into eight different classes on the basis of age and leaf characteristics. Out of the 4960 V. paradoxa plants inspected, 2976 (60 %) was infected with the disease. A range of fungi was isolated from the infected leaves but only Pestalotia spp. was found to be the causal pathogen of leaf spot of V. paradoxa. Nauclea latifolia Smith, a Rubiaceae and <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri Hutch and Dalz, a Caesalpiniaceae were found to be alternative hosts.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of natural products used in Traditional Medicine in Africa is complicated as modern analytical and screening methods {{are often not}} available. Computer aided product identification from traditional usage records (CAPITURE) may provide an interesting alternative and has been evaluated {{in the context of}} an ethnobotanical survey on fungal diseases and their traditional treatment in Tchamba District (Togo). 53 traditional healers were interviewed and their knowledge recorded. Several indicators, the Use Value (UV), Plant Part Value (PPV), Specific Use (SU) Value, Intraspecific Use Value (IUV) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF), were applied to the data. Those indices, in addition to a bibliographic review, were then fed into a computer-aided approach which predicted two interesting plants out of the 43 species survey-recorded and their specific activities: Pterocarpus erinaceus sap against ringworm, <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri sap against intertrigo and respectively their roots and trunk barks against candidiasis. Subsequent laboratory-based studies have confirmed the predicted antimicrobial activities with MIC (128 μg/mL to 30 mg/mL) and without any notable toxicity on a normal human cell (MRC- 5 cells). Although such a method may not be flawless, it is able to provide first leads, and in the face of limited resources, is an attractive alternative worth considering...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} impact of fire regimes on plant diversity and soil fertility {{has become a}} subject of intense discussion, especially in savannas where recurring incidences are common. This study assessed the short-term effects of early-season fire on herbaceous composition, dry matter yield and soil fertility in the Guinea savanna belt of Nigeria. Data on ground cover, dry matter yield (DMY) in plants and concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg in soil were collected from 10 delineated subplots in the burned and unburned zones of four sites after annual wildfire had occurred. Ground cover was significantly higher in the burned zones, increasing progressively from January to April (dry season). Eleven herbaceous species in addition to 2 tree seedlings occurred and represented families of Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Digitaria nuda, Brachiaria lata, <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri and Aeschynomene indica were limited to the burnt zones while Cyperus tuberosus, Mariscus alternifolius and Rottboellia cochinchinensis were restricted to the unburned zones. DMY ranged from 0. 32 g m- 2 (Desmodium tortuosum) to 52. 96 g m- 2 (Megathyrsus maximus). Average biomass in the burned and unburned sites was 35. 86 g m- 2 and 28. 42 g m- 2, respectively. Soil C, N and P concentrations decreased (positive deterioration index - DI), while those of K, Ca and Mg improved (negative DI) in the burned sites. Burning altered the growth (ground cover) and composition of plant species in the short term, and could significantly influence soil nutrient dynamics in the long term, especially with recurring fire events...|$|E
40|$|It {{is obvious}} that major {{economically}} important vascular plants in our forests are declining at an alarming rate. In most forest environments this {{can be attributed to}} human activity. This study was done to identify categories of people involved in the depletion of forest stocks and to identify the main species that were affected in Iwo local government area, Osun State, Nigeria. The study was conducted by administration of a purpose-sampled questionnaire. Results demonstrated that the following species were most frequently exploited for timber and firewood: Vitallaria paradoxa Gaertn F, Anogeissus leocapus (DC) Dull & per Afzelia africana S M, Khaya senegalensis, <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri (Roife) Hutch & Daviz, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Milicia excelsa Welw, Isobelinia doka craib & stapf, Gmelina arborae Roxb, Elias sp and Tectonia grandis L. f, and as such were under threat of extinction in the study area. The threat to these forest plant species was from the effects of population growth and the consequent higher demand for timber products; conditions compounded by the highly increased rate of poverty due to unemployment and illiteracy. These social conditions were responsible for the careless attitude to these major vascular plants by old and young people living in and around this extensive forest environment. Human activities in forests are the responsibility of the local government of an area. Forest management by the local government has an effect on conservation for preservation of forest resources in this south-western part of the country. It is recommended that the general public be made aware of the need to minimize destruction of these forest environments through environmental and conservation education...|$|E
40|$|Diversity, {{pastoral}} {{and conservation}} priorities of fodder {{trees in the}} Sudano-Guinean pasture lands of Benin. Description of the subject. Fodder trees are important for livestock survival in dryland Africa. In view of the pressure faced by these trees, and their consequent rarity noted in rangelands, a {{study was conducted in}} the Sudano-Guinean transition zone of Benin {{at the level of the}} local population surrounding the protected forests of Monts Kouffé, Wari-Maro and Ouémé Supérieur. Objectives. This study aimed to inventory the fodder trees, analyze the local perception of factors threatening target fodder trees, according to different sociolinguistic groups and prioritize fodder trees for conservation. Method. Ethnobiological surveys and ecological data from the available literature were used to construct a database following different criteria. The citation rates of the fodder trees by the surveyed populations were used to establish pastoral priority, while their conservation priority was established using a combination of four methods and nine criteria. Results. Forty-eight fodder trees belonging to 17 families dominated by Leguminosae (27. 1 %) and Moraceae (16. 6 %) were reported. These species were distributed among 37 genera, with the genus Ficus being the most represented (16. 6 %). Palatability, species availability and the impact of tree fodder on animal productivity were the criteria used by the surveyed sociolinguistic groups in their selection of fodder trees. The prioritization methods yielded ten top ranked species: Afzelia africana, Pterocarpus erinaceus, Khaya senegalensis, Vitellaria paradoxa, Mangifera indica, Ficus platyphylla, Balanites aegyptiaca, Annona senegalensis, Ficus umbellata and <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri. Conclusions. With the aim of establishing the sustainable management of pasture lands, we suggest that priority be given to the aforementioned species of fodder trees as part of restoration, afforestation/reforestation and plantation activities...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried {{during the rainy}} seasons of 2010 and 2011 to {{evaluate}} the effects of weed control methods on growth, yield and economic returns in two varieties of groundnut (Arachis hypogeal L cv Samnut 10 and MK 373). The results showed that Brachiaria deflexa, Cleome viscosa, Cochlospermum planchoni, Dactyloctenium aegyptium and <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri were the most preponderant in all twenty-six weed species encountered. Plots where rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth + one hand weeding at 6 weeks after Planting (WAP) Pendimethalin at 1. 5 /ha + one hand weeding at 6 WAP and two hand weeding at 3 and 6 weeks after planting reduced weed population better than those recorded from sole application of rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth and Pendimethalin at 1. 5 ha- 1. The weed free check showed most effective weed reduction (93 - 96 %). The presence of weeds reduced crop yield by 51 %. Highest seed yield of 674. 4 kg ha- 1 and 971. 6 kg ha- 1 in Samnut 10 and MK 373 respectively when average for the two years was recorded from rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth + one hand weeding 6 WAP and followed in decreasing order of magnitude by those of two hand weeding at 3 and 6 WAP, Pendimethalin at 1. 51 ha- 1 + one hand weeding at 6 WAP, sole application of rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth and Pendimethalin at 1. 51 ha- 1 The production value {{in terms of economic}} returns was highest under rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth + one hand weeding at 6 WAP (₦ 77, 240 and ₦ 107, 000 ha- 1) having maximum cost benefit of 2. 15 and 2. 41 in Samnut 10 and MK 373 respectively in 2010. In 2011, the same treatment showed highest net returns of ₦ 166, 040 and N 209, 600 ha- 1 with maximum benefit cost ratio of 3. 42 and 3. 97 in Samnut 10 and MK 373 respectively. The results suggested that the use of rice straw mulch at 0. 1 m depth + one hand weeding at 6 WAP was more economically viable as well as effective in weed control with the advantages of increasing crop growing environment for better yield...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{nematode}} infections {{remain a}} serious global public health threat to humans and animals. These infections cause debilitating conditions in humans and significant economic losses through infection of livestock and crop damage. Control of parasitic nematode diseases {{has continued to}} rely on use of anthelmintic drugs as there is presently no effective vaccine {{for the majority of}} these infections. Over the years, anthelmintic drug discovery has been very slow, and the majority of anthelmintic drugs used in human medicine today were initially developed for animal use as those affected live in the world’s poorest nations that lack the financial means to afford conventional drugs. However, resistance to all the major anthelmintic drug classes has been reported in numerous veterinary parasite species and there are increasing concerns of resistance development in human parasite species. The emergence of widespread resistance therefore underscores the urgent need for the search of new targets, leads and strategies for anthelmintic drug discovery and development. We have identified the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit ACR- 16 from Ascaris suum and showed that ACR- 16 forms a functional homopentameric nAChR when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. A. suum is a gastrointestinal (GI) tract parasitic nematode of pigs that is very closely related to the human equivalent A. lumbricoides. ACR- 16 is not activated by cholinergic anthelmintics and, although ACR- 16 is most closely related to vertebrate  7 receptors based on amino acid sequence alignment, it has some marked pharmacological differences from vertebrate  7 receptors. As opposed to vertebrate  7 receptors, ACR- 16 was insensitive to -bungarotoxin and the effects of ivermectin, genistein and PNU 120596 on ACR- 16 were inhibitory rather than potentiating. The relative calcium permeability ratio for ACR- 16 was about 50 x lower than that for vertebrate  7 receptors. We have showed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that mRNA for ACR- 16 is widely distributed throughout Ascaris tissues; suggesting ACR- 16 may have functions other than neurotransmission. Our results showed, for the first time, the characterization of the pharmacology of ACR- 16 from a parasitic nematode. Based on the pharmacology and expression pattern of ACR- 16 in different tissues of the parasite, we suggest ACR- 16 is an attractive new anthelmintic drug target with ‘resistance-busting’ properties that should be further exploited for therapeutic drug development. Secondly, we have showed that the plants <b>Daniellia</b> oliveri and Psorospermum febrifugum have potential as sources of lead compounds {{for the development of the}} much-needed filaricidal drugs to treat onchocerciasis (river blindness) and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis). We prepared extracts of different polarities from D. oliveri and P. febrifugum and showed these extracts to be active against Onchocerca ochengi microfilariae and adults, and against adult Brugia pahangi based on visual motility scoring, MTT/formazan assay and the Worminator motility measurement system. Importantly, some extracts with O. ochengi microfilariae activity were also active on the adult worm. These extracts also showed activity against adult B. pahangi. We further fractionated the active extracts using Sep-Pak cartridges and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and showed some of these fractions retained activity against adult B. pahangi. We recommend that the active HPLC fractions be further purified to allow for the isolation of the bioactive compounds. This could significantly contribute to chemotherapeutic control of filarial infections currently hampered by the lack of macrofilaricides (adulticides). Lastly, we have demonstrated that use of combination therapy over single drug therapy is a potentially useful tool for increasing efficacy, spectrum of action and reducing the likelihood of resistance development. We showed the combination of derquantel and abamectin to produce a greater inhibition of acetylcholine and pyrantel responses of expressed pyrantel/tribendimidine nAChRs from Oesophagostomum dentatum than derquantel or abamectin used alone. These nAChRs comprise of UNC- 29, UNC- 63 and UNC- 38 subunits. Our results also showed abamectin acts on nAChRs, in addition to its known effects on glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls), implying abamectin has multiple targets. We further showed the action of abamectin on the expressed O. dentatum pyrantel/tribendimidine nAChRs to be bi-phasic, suggesting two allosteric sites of action: a high affinity negative allosteric modulation (NAM) site causing antagonism at lower concentrations (≤ 0. 1 ÃÂÃÂµM) and a lower affinity positive allosteric modulation (PAM) site causing a reduction in the antagonism at higher concentrations ( 0. 3 ÃÂÃÂµM) ...|$|E
