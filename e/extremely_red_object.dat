The source, XBS J 0216 - 0435, belongs to the XMM-Newton Bright Serendipitous Survey and it has extreme X-ray-to-optical (220) and X-ray-to-near-infrared (60) flux ratios. Thanks to its brightness, the X-ray statistics are good enough for an accurate spectral analysis by which the presence of an X-ray obscured (N_ H> 10 ^ 22 cm- 2) QSO (L_ 2 - 10 keV= 4 × 10 ^ 45 erg s- 1) is determined.
