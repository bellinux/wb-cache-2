The establishment of the council reduced the tension on Malaita, although Maasina Rule elements did continue until at least 1955. The council was shown not to be simply appeasement, but submitted nearly seventy resolutions and recommendations to the High Commissioner in its first two years of existence.|$|E

[...] He also noted that it begins the exploration of Mr. Burns [...] "in earnest, {{the first of many}} characters who will receive elaborate coverage as the series advances." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk thought both Lisa's [...] "tremendous intellect" [...] and Marge's [...] "moral compass" [...] were [...] "probed" [...] in the episode, and he thought one [...] "clear highlight" [...] of the episode was Burns's attempts to explain away Blinky's mutation by turning to an actor portraying Charles Darwin who proceeds to give a speech suggesting that Blinky is merely advanced. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "The episode took an unusual approach for an early show, as it focused largely on a secondary character. One could argue that season one’s 'Krusty Gets Busted' did the same, but 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' provided a heavier emphasis on Burns than that prior program did Krusty. This helped make it a fairly good episode. It fleshed out Burns’ character a little better and gave us a reasonably entertaining experience. The episode fell short of greatness, but it worked nicely for the most part." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "masterful".|$|E

2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that it is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, {{two years}} after the {{assassination}} of Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term global war on terror put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. <...> But we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. <...> From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation [...] — [...] and world [...] — [...] that we leave to our children. [...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.

The modern astronomy was then winning its way among men of thought very much as the doctrine of evolution has been winning its way during the last half century.

60|$|I {{was glad}} {{the next morning}} that we had {{neglected}} practical questions, for this gave me a pretext for seeing her again immediately. There was a very practical question to be touched upon. I owed it to her {{to let her know}} formally that of course I did not expect her to keep me on as a lodger, and also to show some interest in her own tenure, what she might have on her hands {{in the way of a}} lease. But I was not destined, as it happened, to converse with her for more than an instant on either of these points. I sent her no message; I simply went down to the sala and walked to and fro there. I knew she would come out; she would very soon discover I was there. Somehow I preferred not to be shut up with her; gardens and big halls seemed better places to talk. It was a splendid morning, with something in the air that told of the waning of the long Venetian summer; a freshness from the sea which stirred the flowers in the garden and made a pleasant draught in the house, less shuttered and darkened now than when the old woman was alive. It was the beginning of autumn, of the end of the golden months. With this it was the end of my experiment--or would be in the course of half an hour, when I should really have learned that the papers had been reduced to ashes. After that there would be nothing left for me but to go to the station; for seriously (and as it struck me in the morning light) I could not linger there to act as guardian to a piece of middle-aged female helplessness. If she had not saved the papers wherein should I be indebted to her? I think I winced a little as I asked myself how much, if she HAD saved them, I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> and, as it were, to reward such a courtesy. Might not that circumstance after all saddle me with a guardianship? If this idea did not make me more uncomfortable as I walked up and down it was because I was convinced I had nothing to look to. If the old woman had not destroyed everything before she pounced upon me in the parlor she had done so afterward.|$|E
6000|$|If we are {{to discuss}} the {{importance}} of art, learning, and intellectual culture, {{the first thing we}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> is that we have very little of them at present; and that this little has not been produced by compulsory education: nay, that the scarcity is unnatural and has been produced by the violent exclusion of art and artists from schools. On the other hand we have quite a considerable degree of bodily culture: indeed there is a continual outcry against the sacrifice of mental accomplishments to athletics. In other words a sacrifice of the professed object of compulsory education to the real object of voluntary education. It is assumed that this means that people prefer bodily to mental culture; but may it not mean that they prefer liberty and satisfaction to coercion and privation. Why is it that people who have been taught Shakespear as a school subject loathe his plays and cannot by any means be persuaded ever to open his works after they escape from school, whereas there is still, 300 years after his death, a wide and steady sale for his works to people who read his plays as plays, and not as task work? If Shakespear, or for that matter, Newton and Leibnitz, are allowed to find their readers and students they will find them. If their works are annotated and paraphrased by dullards, and the annotations and paraphrases forced on all young people by imprisonment and flogging and scolding, {{there will not be a}} single man of letters or higher mathematician the more in the country: on the contrary there will be less, as so many potential lovers of literature and mathematics will have been incurably prejudiced against them. Everyone who is conversant with the class in which child imprisonment and compulsory schooling is carried out to the final extremity of the university degree knows that its scholastic culture is a sham; that it knows little about literature or art and a great deal about point-to-point races; and that the village cobbler, who has never read a page of Plato, and is admittedly a dangerously ignorant man politically, is nevertheless a Socrates compared to the classically educated gentlemen who discuss politics in country houses at election time (and at no other time) after their day's earnest and skilful shooting. Think of the years and years of weary torment the women of the piano-possessing class have been forced to spend over the keyboard, fingering scales. How many of them could be bribed to attend a pianoforte recital by a great player, though they will rise from sick beds rather than miss Ascot or Goodwood? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{this project}} is at once more modest in form and more ambitious in {{substance}} than almost any school scheme or prospectus the reader is likely to encounter. Let us (on the assumption of our opening paragraph) inquire {{what is needed to}} carry it into execution. So far as 1 and 2 in this table go, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that since the development of elementary schools in England introduced a spirit of endeavour into teaching, there has been a steady progress in the art of education. Reading and writing are taught somehow or other to most people nowadays, they are frequently taught quickly and well, especially well, I think, in view of the raw material, in many urban Board Schools in England, and there is nothing to do here but to inquire if anything can be done to make this teaching, which is so exceptional in attaining its goal, still quicker and easier, and in bringing the average up {{to the level of the}} present best. We have already suggested as the work of an imaginary English Language Society, how much might be done in providing everywhere, cheaply and unavoidably, the best possible reading-books, and it is manifest that the standard of copy-books for writing might also be pressed upward by similar methods. In addition, we have to consider--what is to me a most uncongenial subject--the possible rationalization of English spelling. I will frankly confess I know English as much by sight as by sound, and that any extensive or striking alteration, indeed that almost any alteration, in the printed appearance of English, worries me extremely. Even such little things as Mr. Bernard Shaw's weakness for printing [...] "I've" [...] as [...] "Ive," [...] and the American [...] "favor," [...] "thro," [...] and [...] "catalog" [...] catch at my attention as it travels along the lane of meaning, like trailing briars. But I have to admit this habit of the old spelling, which I am sure most people over four-and-twenty share with me, will trouble neither me nor any one else who reads books now, in the year 1990. I have to admit that the thing is an accident of my circumstances. I have learnt to read and write in a certain way, and I am concerned with the thing said and not with the vehicle, and so it is that it distresses me when the medium behaves in an unusual way and distracts my attention from the thing it conveys. But if it is true--and I think it must be true--that the extremely arbitrary spelling of English--and more especially of the more familiar English words--greatly increases the trouble of learning to read and write, I do not think the mental comfort of one or two generations of grown-up people must be allowed to stand in the way of a permanent economy in the educational process. I believe even that such a reader as I might come to be very easy in the new way. But whatever is done must be done widely, simultaneously, all over the English-speaking community, and after the fullest consideration. The local [...] "spelling reform" [...] of a few half-educated faddists here and there, helps not at all, is a mere nuisance. This is a thing to be worked out in a scientific way by the students of phonetics; they must have a complete alphabet settled for good, a dictionary ready, reading-books well tested, the whole system polished and near perfection before the thing passes out of the specialists' hands. The really practical spelling-reformer will devote his guineas to endowing chairs of phonetics and supporting publication in phonetic science, and his time to study and open-minded discussion. Such organisations as the Association Phonétique Internationale, may be instanced. Systems concocted in a hurry, in a half-commercial or wholly commercial and in a wholly presumptuous manner, pushed like religious panaceas and advertised like soap--Pitman's System, Barnum's System, Quackbosh the Gifted Postman's System, and all that sort of thing--do nothing but vulgarize, discredit, and retard this work.|$|E
