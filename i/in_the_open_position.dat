5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position</b> and flooded the engine room. While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time}} that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position.</b> On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
25|$|It {{would appear}} that the bow of Scorpion skidded upon impact with the globigerina ooze on the sea floor, digging a sizable trench.

25|$|According to {{internal}} GM documents, the ultimate culprit {{appears to be}} operating vehicles {{for long periods of}} time with low coolant levels. The low coolant is caused by pressure caps that fail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position.</b> (The new caps and recovery bottles were introduced at the same time as DEX-COOL). This exposes hot engine components to air and vapors, causing corrosion and contamination of the coolant with iron oxide particles, which in turn can aggravate the pressure cap problem as contamination holds the caps open permanently.|$|E

The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan {{implements}} {{a version}} of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position.</b> The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.|$|E
25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account {{for the sound of}} sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who was known for his whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position</b> (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become unstuck after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position.</b> This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E

500|$|One {{week before}} the Canadian Grand Prix, the FIA {{declared}} the floor used by Red Bull in Monaco to be illegal, forcing the team to change the offending parts for the Canadian Grand Prix. Despite the ruling, the team's results were kept intact. The team was also forced to change the design of their axles, after FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting felt that holes in the axles contravened the technical regulations. Nevertheless, Sebastian Vettel comfortably took pole position by three-tenths of a second. Vettel controlled the early phase of the race, but was caught and passed by Lewis Hamilton before {{the first round of}} stops, while Fernando Alonso slipped through shortly afterwards. All three drivers were using a two-stop strategy at the time, but as Hamilton made his second stop, both Alonso and Vettel shifted to a one-stop strategy, with Alonso's team resorting to discussing strategy options in his native Spanish to prevent their rivals from overhearing their plans. Hamilton had twenty laps to make up a twelve-second deficit, and he easily reeled Vettel in; in response, Red Bull pitted the reigning World Champion, and Vettel fell to fifth. Hamilton's next target was Alonso, whose tyres lost all grip and he fell victim to Hamilton, Romain Grosjean, Sergio Pérez and Vettel in quick succession. Hamilton won the race, becoming the seventh winner in seven races and taking a two-point lead in the championship. Grosjean's second place saw Lotus take third place in the Constructors' Championship from Ferrari. Both Grosjean and Pérez expressed surprise at finishing on the podium, while 2011 winner Jenson Button finished sixteenth in what he described as his [...] "worst race in years" [...] and Michael Schumacher suffered a hydraulics failure that left his drag reduction system (DRS) device jammed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{downstream}} {{demand valve}} {{serves as a}} fail safe for over-pressurization: if a first stage with a demand valve malfunctions and jams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>position,</b> the demand valve will be over-pressurized and will [...] "free flow". Although it presents the diver with an imminent [...] "out of air" [...] crisis, this failure mode lets gas escape directly into the water without inflating buoyancy devices.

There are circumstances where regulators are connected to inflatable equipment such as a rebreather's breathing bag, a buoyancy compensator, or a drysuit, but {{without the need for}} demand valves. Examples of this are argon suit inflation sets and [...] "off board" [...] or secondary diluent cylinders for closed-circuit rebreathers. When no demand valve is connected to a regulator, it should be equipped with a pressure relief valve, unless it has a built in over pressure valve, so that over-pressurization does not inflate any buoyancy devices connected to the regulator.|$|E

5000|$|Telephone {{service was}} {{restored}} {{the morning of}} the 18th, allowing better artillery coordination in support of La Ferté. By the afternoon of 18 May, the Germans had occupied the village of Villy, completing the encirclement of the ouvrage. Between 1400 and 1500 hours on the 18th, Block 2's automatic rifle/observation (GFM) cloche was hit by German fire, killing three. At about the same time, the retractable mixed arms turret on Block 2 became stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opened</b> <b>position,</b> facing to <b>the</b> rear and unable to aim. [...] As this comprised La Ferté's heaviest armament, it significantly reduced the position's defensive strength. At 1700 hours, Germans entered the vacant Villy Est casemate, occupying Villy Ouest an hour later. Both had been evacuated by the French amid concerns about the German presence on Hill 311. From 1800-1830 three batteries of German 210mm howitzers fired on La Ferté with supporting fire on the fort's surroundings from 155mm howitzers. [...] At 1810 four German 88mm guns <b>opened</b> fire on <b>the</b> exposed portions of the main ouvrage. The combined artillery fire destroyed the barbed wire entanglements surrounding La Ferté and cratered the ground. Firing ceased after 20 minutes to allow German sappers to destroy the previously damaged GFM cloche. They then threw smoke bombs into the resulting hole and destroyed the stuck turret and two more cloches, leaving Block 2 incapable of further resistance. Supporting fire from Chesnois was hampered by smoke shells that obscured French observation posts' view of La Ferté.|$|R
