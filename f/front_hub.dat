5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. The distance from the bottom bracket to the <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E
25|$|Moore's winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a {{diamond-shaped}} iron downtube and a {{top tube}} and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, including the wheels. The back wheel has a diameter of 31inches, the front 38inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the <b>front</b> <b>hub),</b> so the gear is low. The machine's saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.|$|E

50|$|For {{model year}} 1981, {{automatic}} locking <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> were added for shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive models, and the NP208 transfer case replaced the NP205 in most models.|$|R
50|$|Dynohubs {{were offered}} as <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> and as rear geared hubs. The AG was an AW three-speed rear hub with inbuilt dynamo, while the FG was a dynamo {{similarly}} {{combined with an}} FW four-speed.|$|R
50|$|Racing {{enhancements}} {{including an}} aluminum radiator, adjustable front suspension, aluminum <b>front</b> <b>hubs,</b> a quick-change rear end, steel racing wheels, and coil over shocks and springs. An aluminum racing seat, 5-point harness, and window nets {{are required for}} safety.|$|R
2500|$|A further {{development}} was the Indian Velo 500, a limited-production run using a Velocette single-cylinder engine and gearbox with mainly Italian cycle parts, including a lightweight frame from the Italjet company, Marzocchi front forks with Grimeca <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> having a twin-leading shoe brake, Borrani aluminium rims and quickly-detachable tank and seat, {{resulting in a}} weight-saving of [...] compared to the traditional Velocette Venom.|$|E

2500|$|Bicycle {{drum brakes}} operate {{like those of}} a car, {{although}} the bicycle variety use cable rather than hydraulic actuation. [...] Two pads are pressed outward against the braking surface {{on the inside of the}} hub shell. [...] Shell inside diameters on a bicycle drum brake are typically [...] [...] Drum brakes have been used on <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> and hubs with both internal and external freewheels. [...] Both cable- and rod-operated drum brake systems have been widely produced.|$|R
5000|$|The Mazda AZ-Offroad, {{introduced}} in October 1998, is a rebadged Jimny. The AZ {{in the name}} refers to Autozam, Mazda's ill-fated small car marque. It is fitted with the turbocharged 660 cc DOHC Suzuki K6A engine, which produces [...] Manually operated four wheel drive is standard with auto locking <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> and low range, whilst an automatic transmission is optional.|$|R

5000|$|From 1992, the UBS {{series was}} {{available}} with a pushrod overhead valve (OHV) 3.1-liter inline-four engine intercooled turbo diesel (designated [...] "4JG2") producing [...] at 3,600 rpm, and 260 Nm at 2000 rpm. It was {{offered as a}} more rugged and fuel-efficient option for towing and heavy-duty operation, relative to the standard 3.2-liter petrol. The diesel-powered Jackaroo was available with a five-speed manual transmission and manual <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> only coupled to a part-time four-wheel drive system with open front and limited slip rear differentials. The 3.2-liter V6 petrol engine version was also available with an optional four-speed automatic transmission with automatic locking <b>front</b> <b>hubs.</b> The same diesel engine was also available in the UK and other markets with a belt-driven overhead camshaft, which developed slightly more power. After 1998, {{and the introduction of}} the [...] "4JX1" [...] 3.0-liter diesel engine, a four-speed automatic transmission was made available in addition to the five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
5000|$|On 4x4 models {{there is}} a choice of a manual {{chain-driven}} transfer case floor shifter with manual <b>front</b> locking <b>hubs</b> or Electronic-Shift-On-the-Fly (ESOF, a $185 option over the manual) dash knob with vacuum activated automatic and (in case of failure) manual override <b>front</b> <b>hubs.</b> The optional FX4 models are basically a standard 4x4 with an Off Road package that includes a few extras like upgraded heavy duty Rancho shocks, limited-slip rear differential, added skid plates for the fuel tank and transfer case, and two [...] "FX4" [...] decals on both back bed-sides instead of the standard [...] "4x4". For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed transfer case 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1. Brazilian and Venezuelan versions had only the ESOF transfer case.|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} chassis {{and engine}} were then {{shipped to the}} Maserati restoration experts at Steve Hart Racing in England. In completing the restoration, the restoration facility added additional original Birdcage parts including rear lights, repeater lights, rev counter, ignition switch (also known as the light switch), starter button, indicator switch (also known as turn signal), and <b>front</b> <b>hubs.</b> This information is verified in a letter written and signed by the restoration facility owner.|$|R
50|$|Hub {{generators}} {{were absent}} from Sturmey-Archer's product {{range from the}} 1980s until the 2006 introduction of the X-FDD <b>front</b> <b>hub,</b> which combines a 6v, 0.4 A (2.4 W) or 0.5 A (3 W) dynamo with a 70 mm drum brake.|$|E
50|$|Auto 3 - The hub is {{fitted with}} a 3 speed {{automatic}} gear system, which utilizes a <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> dynamo to power a CPU that automatically changes the three speed internally geared hub. A similar system was built for the nexus 4.|$|E
5000|$|... "Brompton E-Freedom" [...] - {{an upgrade}} to convert a basic Brompton to an {{electric}} bike {{by adding a}} powerful electric <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> motor to the Brompton, with nano-technology batteries, the whole kit (incl motor, battery, controller & throttle) adds only 3.2 kg to the overall bike's weight.|$|E
50|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{from the late}} 1950s onwards, Fairey {{acquired}} Mayflower Automotive Products, including their factory in Tavistock, Devon, {{and with it the}} designs of its products, including winch and free-wheeling <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> for Land Rover vehicles. By the 1970s Fairey was manufacturing a wide range of winches, covering mechanical, hydraulic and electric drive and capstan/drum configurations. Fairey winches formed the bulk of the manufacturer-approved winch options for Land Rover throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|Disc brakes {{require a}} hub built {{to accept the}} disc, and a fork (for front brakes) or frame (for rear brakes) built to accept the caliper. <b>Front</b> <b>hubs</b> {{designed}} for discs often move the left hub's flange inward {{to make room for}} the disc, which causes the wheel to be dished. A dished wheel is laterally weaker when forced to the non-disc side. Other hubs use conventional flange spacing and provide a wheel without dish, but require a less common wide-spaced fork.|$|R
50|$|The MK Indy is a Lotus 7 replica {{based on}} the Locost principle, built by MK Sportscars in Maltby, Rotherham. The Indy has an {{independent}} rear suspension using the differential and drive shafts from a Ford Sierra. It uses many other components from the Sierra, including <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> and steering rack. Further, it can be fitted with any {{of a variety of}} engines, the most popular choices being the Ford Pinto engine from the Sierra for its ease and cheapness or a large motorcycle engine for its light weight and high rpm.|$|R
50|$|However, any pedelec {{where the}} power {{assistance}} is triggered by merely turning wheels rather than pedal motion (a {{large number of}} cheap versions or notoriously <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> assistance), are required to have a licence plate for a scooter / small motorcycle (so called snorfiets or bromfiets), a valid driving licence and an insurance.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, a later {{version of}} the Trado 3 {{conversion}} added drive to the front wheels and so converted a 6×4 vehicle to 6×6 drive. Unlike most all-wheel-drive vehicles, the front axle {{was no longer a}} live beam axle with added articulation for steering, but used two separate drive shafts, one to each <b>front</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|E
5000|$|With {{the center}} of gravity low and between the wheels, rather than high and over the <b>front</b> <b>hub,</b> the safety bicycle greatly diminished the danger of [...] "taking a header" [...] or long fall over the handlebars. This made braking more {{effective}} and cycling, previously the reserve of spry, daring young men, safer, and therefore much more popular, especially for women.|$|E
50|$|The P100 {{was longer}} than the {{corresponding}} Cortina and Sierra models, and had a higher ride height due to having a multi leaf spring suspension in the rear and larger five-stud wheels all round. The hub design on the Cortina was a SA specific pattern and actually a Rover PCD, hence Rover SD1 alloys and steel wheels fit. The later Sierra <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> were from the Granada with adapter plates to allow fitment of the heavier duty Ford Transit wheel. Its rear axle was lifted directly from the SWB Transit 80, hence {{the need for the}} front adapters to match.|$|R
50|$|In {{mountain}} biking the term 'suspension hub' {{was used in}} the 90s to describe hubs with oversized axle ends and a thicker axles than were customary at the time. These hubs were designed to stiffen up suspension forks, which were still somewhat of a novelty, by rigidly holding the fork legs in position relative to each other once the wheel was fitted, improving steering response in the fork. This term is no longer used as this function is no longer an exceptional requirement for mountain bike <b>front</b> <b>hubs,</b> so all current mountain bike hubs are suspension hubs.|$|R
5000|$|... 2 <b>hubs,</b> <b>front</b> {{and rear}} (although, most {{manufacturers}} now offer groupset-branded pre-built wheels) ...|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} was the Indian Velo 500, a limited-production run using a Velocette single-cylinder engine and gearbox with mainly Italian cycle parts, including a lightweight frame from the Italjet company, Marzocchi front forks with Grimeca <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> having a twin-leading shoe brake, Borrani aluminium rims and quickly-detachable tank and seat, {{resulting in a}} weight-saving of 45 lb compared to the traditional Velocette Venom.|$|E
5000|$|PE250C {{released}} - 30+ detail improvements {{over the}} 250B.Main improvements were altered 3rd gear ratio, new leading-axle forks, longer rear shock absorbers, altered fork rake, new conical <b>front</b> <b>hub,</b> improved magneto coils, new headlight & tail-light assemblies, plastic 12 litre tank, optional trip-meter, optional centre-stand, engine bash-plate changed, timing, porting and crankshaft changes. New [...] "All-in-one" [...] tool on fork, stronger foot-pegs, rock-guard on swing-arm.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Velo 500 was a limited-production run of updated {{machines}} {{conceived by}} American entrepreneur Floyd Clymer in 1968, using a Velocette engine and gearbox with mainly Italian cycle parts, including a lightweight frame from the Italjet company, Marzocchi front forks with Grimeca <b>front</b> <b>hub</b> having a twin-leading shoe brake, Borrani aluminium rims and quickly-detachable tank and seat, {{resulting in a}} weight-saving of 45 lb compared to the traditional Venom.|$|E
50|$|Four {{wheel drive}} for heavy {{vehicles}} {{in this period}} was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the steering joints of the front axle. Rather than the common system of articulated drive shafts to the <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> (the shaft either inside an axle casing or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the axle casing carried power {{to the ends of}} the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the hub carrier (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself.|$|R
50|$|A common {{complaint}} {{about the first}} generation models is that the light-duty A4LD automatic transmission, which was basically the 3-speed Ford C3 transmission with an overdrive gear, was not well-suited for towing {{and was unable to}} cope with higher power output from modified engines. The A4LD was also known to suffer premature failure of the overdrive gear (or 4th gear) when used to frequently tow or haul heavy loads. Improved fluid cooling using aftermarket transmission coolers can alleviate these issues. Also, the automatic locking <b>front</b> <b>hubs</b> on four-wheel drive vehicles tended to fail prematurely; the manual versions, made for Ford by Warn, suffered from fewer reliability problems.|$|R
5000|$|In the US, the Dionne Warwick {{original}} {{remains the}} only version of [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] to chart. In 1968, the Lettermen had a single release of the song as the B-side of their [...] "bubbling under" [...] hit [...] "All the Grey Haired Men" [...] (#109); {{it is the second}} track on the first side of their album [...] "Goin Out of My Head" [...] (Capitol ST2865). Peter Rivera of Rare Earth sang lead on a 1975 remake of [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart" [...] <b>fronting</b> <b>HUB.</b> In 2008, the Shelby Lynne recording from Just a Little Lovin was issued as a digital single release.|$|R
