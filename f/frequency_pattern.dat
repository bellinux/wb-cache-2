40|$|International audienceA new {{framework}} {{to track the}} structure of temporal networks with a signal processing approach is introduced. The method {{is based on the}} duality between static networks and signals, obtained using a multidimensional scaling technique, that makes possible the study of the network structure from <b>frequency</b> <b>patterns</b> of the corresponding signals. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify structures in temporal networks by extracting the most significant <b>frequency</b> <b>patterns</b> and their activation coefficients over time, using nonnegative matrix factorization of the temporal spectra. The framework, inspired by audio decomposition, allows transforming back these <b>frequency</b> <b>patterns</b> into networks, to highlight the evolution of the underlying structure of the network over time. The effectiveness of the method is first evidenced on a synthetic example, prior being used to study a temporal network of face-to-face contacts. The extracted sub-networks highlight significant structures decomposed on time intervals that validates the relevance of the approach on real-world data...|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} how the distortion comes about, let us consider an ideal linear process from sampling to display. When a signal is sampled at a frequency that is at least double the Nyquist frequency, it can be fully reconstructed by low-pass filtering since the first repeat spectra does not overlap the original baseband spectra. In discrete displays the image signal is not low-pass filtered since the display takes discrete values as input, i.e. the signal displayed contains all the repeat spectra. The proximity of the highest frequency of the baseband signal to the lowest frequency of the first repeat spectra induces the beat <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern.</b> The pattern seen on screen can at times be similar to a Moiré pattern. The Kell factor is the reduction necessary in signal bandwidth such that no beat frequency is perceived by the viewer.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} correlations between the performance of children in auditory temporal tests (<b>Frequency</b> <b>Pattern</b> and Gaps in Noise - GIN) and IQ, attention, memory and age measurements.

40|$|Our {{ability to}} detect {{prominent}} changes in complex acoustic scenes depends {{not only on the}} ear's sensitivity but also on the capacity of the brain to process competing incoming information. Here, employing a combination of psychophysics and magnetoencephalography (MEG), we investigate listeners' sensitivity in situations when two features belonging to the same auditory object change in close succession. The auditory object under investigation is a sequence of tone pips characterized by a regularly repeating <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern.</b> Signals consisted of an initial, regularly alternating sequence of three short (60 msec) pure tone pips (in the form ABCABC…) followed by a long pure tone with a frequency that is either expected based on the on-going regular pattern (“LONG expected”—i. e., “LONG-expected”) or constitutes a pattern violation (“LONG-unexpected”). The change in LONG-expected is manifest as a change in duration (when the long pure tone exceeds the established duration of a tone pip), whereas the change in LONG-unexpected is manifest as a change in both the <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> and a change in the duration. Our results reveal a form of “change deafness,” in that although changes in both the <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> and the expected duration appear to be processed effectively by the auditory system—cortical signatures of both changes are evident in the MEG data—listeners often fail to detect changes in the <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> when that change is closely followed by a change in duration. By systematically manipulating the properties of the changing features and measuring behavioral and MEG responses, we demonstrate that feature changes within the same auditory object, which occur close together in time, appear to compete for perceptual resources. 15 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Delta Scuti (δ Sct) {{stars are}} intermediate-mass pulsators, whose {{intrinsic}} oscillations {{have been studied}} for decades. However, modelling their pulsations remains a real theoretical challenge, thereby even hampering the precise determination of global stellar parameters. In this work, we used space photometry observations of eclipsing binaries with a δ Sct component to obtain reliable physical parameters and oscillation frequencies. Using that information, we derived an observational scaling relation between the stellar mean density and a <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> in the oscillation spectrum. This pattern {{is analogous to the}} solar-like large separation but in the low order regime. We also show that this relation is independent of the rotation rate.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{asteroseismology}} {{relies heavily on}} our ability to identify the frequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. For stars like the Sun this is relatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern described by a well-founded asymptotic relation. When a solar like star evolves off the main sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramatically resulting in changes in the <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> of the modes. We follow {{the evolution of the}} adiabatic <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> from the main sequence to near the tip of the red giant branch for a series of models. We find a significant departure from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the red giant branch tip, resulting in a triplet <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern.</b> To support our investigation we analyze almost four years of Kepler data of the most luminous stars in the field (late K and early M type) and find that their frequency spectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for the most luminous stars in our sample. Our identification explains previous results from ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the Petersen diagram and sub ridges in the period-luminosity diagram. Finally, we find `new ridges' of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our model calculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that {{a higher level of}} education is associated with better performance on cognitive tests among middle-aged and elderly people. However, the effects of education on auditory processing skills have not yet been evaluated. Previous demonstrations of sensory-cognitive interactions in the aging process indicate the potential importance of this topic. Therefore, the primary {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the performance of middle-aged and elderly people with different levels of formal education on auditory processing tests. A total of 177 adults with no evidence of cognitive, psychological or neurological conditions took part in the research. The participants completed a series of auditory assessments, including dichotic digit, <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> and speech-in-noise tests. A working memory test was also performed to investigate the extent to which auditory processing and cognitive performance were associated. The results demonstrated positive but weak correlations between years of schooling and performance on all of the tests applied. The factor years of schooling was also one of the best predictors of <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> and speech-in-noise test performance. Additionally, performance on the working memory, <b>frequency</b> <b>pattern</b> and dichotic digit tests was also correlated, suggesting that the influence of educational level on auditory processing performance might be associated with the cognitive demand of the auditory processing tests rather than auditory sensory aspects itself. Longitudinal research is required to investigate the causal relationship between educational level and auditory processing skills...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that during saccadic eye movements, {{contrast}} sensitivity for low spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>patterns</b> modulated in luminance is selectively reduced by up to one logarithmic unit, while high spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>patterns,</b> and equiluminant patterns of all spatial frequencies are not suppressed at all: [Burr et al. (1994). Nature, 371, 511 - 513]. Here we study the temporal characteristics for sensitivity to luminance and chromatic patterns during saccades, using the two-pulse summation technique. Sensitivity was measured for detecting two successive pulses {{as a function of}} stimulus-onset asynchrony, during normal viewing and during saccades, Impulse response functions were estimated from the summation data, for all conditions. For equiluminance, the functions were monophasic during normal viewing and saccades. For luminance modulation, the impulse response functions were di-phasic in both normal viewing and saccades. However, during saccades the impulse responses were faster in normal viewing. This result is consistent with the suggestion that saccadic suppression is mediated by contrast gain control mechanisms, known to occur in M-cells but not P-cells.
