5000|$|In 1906 {{fishermen}} from Vágur made a <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> {{from the}} gorge Múlagjógv {{in the west}} towards east to Vágseiði.

The T52 was one of the {{so-called}} [...] "Fish cyphers", that, using transposition, created nearly one quintillion (893,622,318,929,520,960) different variations. It took Beurling two weeks to solve the problem using pen and paper. Using Beurling's work, a device was created that enabled Sweden to decipher German teleprinter traffic passing through Sweden from Norway on a <b>cable.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>way,</b> Swedish authorities knew about Operation Barbarossa before it occurred. Since the Swedes would not reveal how this knowledge was attained, the Swedish warning was not treated as credible by Soviets.|$|R

The trolleys are pulled along by arecirculating rope operated by a winch. The empty trolley is pulled alongby the same rope along a <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> running near the bottom of the 'A'post,. Several trolleys can move simultaneously along the <b>cable</b> <b>way.</b> With a 2 HP motor the trolley speed was noticed to be about 0. 3 m/s andthe overall performance of the prototype was satisfactory.

50|$|The park {{which is}} divided into three zones has a network of hiking trails. The National Park Service (NPS) {{maintains}} good information system about these trails. One such trail goes up the Mount Alava, a high peak within the park rising to a height of 491 m. A TV tower exists on this mountain and also the ruins of a cable car station of a 1.8 km long <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> which once ran over Pago Pago Harbor to Solo hill in Utulei. (524m). This <b>cable</b> <b>way,</b> which was the only single <b>way</b> <b>cable</b> <b>in</b> the world at that time built in 1965, was damaged when a Navy plane attempted to fly under it and was caught by one of the cables, on April 17, 1980 and was permanently put out of commission. The <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> was used to transport the TV technicians to the transmission station. The descent from the peak passes through lovely vistas of the lowlands of the park and the rain forests which abounds in several bird species. Another ridge trail runs from Fagasa Pass over a length of 6.5 km, goes through a very steep slopes behind the rest fale (hurricane shelter), which is also negotiated through a stairway and further leads down to the serene Vatia village on the coral bay.|$|R
50|$|The Madona Radio Towers {{were built}} in 1932 to serve as radio towers in Madona. The towers were built {{along with the other}} {{transmitters}} and the radio station or centre. The construction of the radio centre and the <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> as a whole was proposed by engineer Jānis Linters. When the construction of the whole <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> was finally commenced in 1932, 10 Latvian men were assigned to the Madona Radio Towers, with radio engineer Remberts Martinsons preparing the plans for the construction. In the same year, the <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> finally finished its half-a-year wide construction, with the Madona Radio Towers being the tallest. The towers were later on dismantled in July 1944 by the invading Nazi German soldiers during the second world war in the year 1944.|$|R
40|$|Electronic loads {{are used}} at Ericsson AB for test and {{verification}} of on-board DC/DC converters. The {{problem with the}} existing electronic loads is that they require cables to connect to the board due to their dimensions. Cables will introduce inductance in the load current path and affect the testing results, especially the current slew rate. In this thesis a new load design is developed which can be soldered directly on the circuit board and eliminating the use of <b>cables.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>way</b> the converters can be tested with higher current slew rates than before, meeting future needs. With the existing electronic loads the maximum achievable current slew rate was 2. 5 A/s from a 3. 3 V supply using 80 cm cable.

40|$|In this paper, dynamic {{analysis}} of cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) {{is performed using}} the Lagrangian variable mass formulation. This formulation is used to treat the effect of amass stream entering into the system caused by elongation of the <b>cables.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>way,</b> a complete dynamic model {{of the system is}} derived, while preserving the compact and tractable closed-form dynamics formulation. First, a general formulation for a CDPM is given, and the effect of change of mass <b>in</b> the <b>cables</b> is integrated into its dynamics. The significance of such a treatment is that a complete analysis of the dynamics of the system is achieved, including vibrations, stability, and any robust control synthesis of the manipulator. The formulation obtained is applied to a typical planar CDPM. Through numerical simulations, the validity and integrity of the formulations are verified, and the significance of the variable mass treatment in the analysis is examined. For this example, it is shown that the effect of introducing a mass stream into the system is not negligible. Moreover, it is non linear and strongly dependent on the geometric and inertial parameters of the robot, as well as themaneuvering trajectory...|$|R
50|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle the dystroglycan complex {{works as a}} transmembrane linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. alpha-dystroglycan is extracellular and binds to merosin alpha-2 laminin in the basement membrane, while beta-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein and binds to dystrophin, which is a large rod-like cytoskeletal protein, absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Dystrophin binds to intracellular actin <b>cables.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>way,</b> the dystroglycan complex, which links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cables, is thought to provide structural integrity in muscle tissues. The dystroglycan complex is also known {{to serve as an}} agrin receptor in muscle, where it may regulate agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering at the neuromuscular junction. There is also evidence which suggests the function of dystroglycan {{as a part of the}} signal transduction pathway because it is shown that Grb2, a mediator of the Ras-related signal pathway, can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of dystroglycan.|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} the yeast actin cytoskeleton at the ultrastructural level using immunoelectron microscopy. Anti-actin antibodies primarily labeled dense, patchlike cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables.

Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments {{were conducted with}} antibodies to actin together with antibodies to the actin binding proteins Abp 1 p and cofilin. As expected from immunofluorescence experiments, Abp 1 p, cofilin, and actin colocalized in immuno-EM to the dense patchlike structures {{but not to the}} <b>cables.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>way,</b> we can unambiguously identify the patches as the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cortical actin patches were observed {{to be associated with the}} cell surface via an invagination of plasma membrane. This novel cortical cytoskeleton- plasma membrane interface appears to consist of a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane around which actin filaments and actin binding proteins are organized. We propose a possible role for this unique cortical structure in wall growth and osmotic regulation...|$|R
