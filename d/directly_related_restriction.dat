40|$|OBJECTIVES: How {{and when}} {{concerns}} about falls emerge {{is not yet}} completely known, because these concerns are present in both people with and without a falls history. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of catastrophic beliefs about falls and previous falls in the development of concerns about falls and resulting mobility restrictions (MR). METHOD: Within a cross-sectional design, 896 older people (mean age 76. 2 +/- 4. 7) living independently in the community completed a battery of questionnaires. Self-report data was gathered on previous falls, catastrophic beliefs about consequences of a fall (Catastrophizing About Falls Scale), concerns about falls (modified Falls Efficacy Scale) and mobility restrictions during daily life (Sickness Impact Profile 68). RESULTS: Using structural equation modelling, we found that the number of falls in the previous year was not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to mobility <b>restrictions</b> in daily life, but via an increase of concerns about falls. Also catastrophic beliefs about the consequences of falls were related to concerns about falls and to mobility restrictions. Goodness-of-fit indices revealed that the presented model had an acceptable fit. Alternative models resulted in lesser-fit indices. CONCLUSION: Both previous falls and catastrophic beliefs about falls are unique and independent predictors of concerns about falls and, subsequently, of mobility restrictions. A cognitive-behavioural perspective upon mobility restrictions may provide important additional components for treatment and prevention of excessive concerns about falls in older people. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The network {{structure}} of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels obtained by freezing-thawing cycles was investigated by solid-state 1 H low-field NMR spectroscopy. By {{the application of}} multiple-quantum NMR experiments, we obtain information about the segmental order parameter, which is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the <b>restrictions</b> on chain motion (cross-links) formed upon gelation. These measurements indicate that the network mesh size {{as well as the}} relative amount of nonelastic defects (i. e., non-cross-linked chains, dangling chains, loops) decrease with the number of freezing-thawing cycles but are independent of the polymer concentration. The formation of the PVA network is accompanied by an increasing fraction of polymer with fast magnetization decay (∼ 20 µs). The quantitative study of this rigid phase with a specific refocusing pulse sequence shows that it is composed of a primary crystalline polymer phase (∼ 5 %), which constitutes the main support of the {{network structure}} and determines the mesh size, and a secondary population of more imperfect crystallites, which increase the number of elastic chain segments in the polymer gel but do not affect the average network mesh size appreciably. Correspondingly, progressive melting of the secondary crystallites with increasing temperature does not affect the network mesh size but only the amount of network defects, and melting of the main PVA crystallites at ∼ 80 °C leads to the destruction of the network gel and the formation of an isotropic PVA solution...|$|R
