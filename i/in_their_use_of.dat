In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees {{growing on the}} slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} the growing role of admixtures in sustainability of concrete construction. Focusing {{on the most}} relevant types of cement and concrete admixtures, it shows how such products have a direct/indirect impact on the main sustainability criteria, first <b>in</b> <b>their</b> manufacture (<b>use</b> <b>of</b> biodegradable raw materials, conception of environmentally-friendly admixtures), then <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> (improvement <b>of</b> health & safety, environmental and durability aspects). Recent attempts to design and compute the global contribution of admixtures in concrete sustainability are finally described...|$|R
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E
5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes. In 1645, the Venetians and their allies possessed a fleet of 60–70 galleys, 4 galleasses and about 36 galleons. The Venetians were also superior <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a mixed fleet of both galleys and sailing ships, while initially, the Ottoman navy relied almost exclusively on galleys. In order to bolster their forces, both opponents hired armed merchantmen from the Netherlands, and later from England (especially the Ottomans), to augment their forces.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was {{well in advance of}} other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E

5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the same residence {{for more than seven}} centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a naïve and parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} {{argues that}} changes in adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) payments may lead households {{to cut back on}} consumption or to default on <b>their</b> mortgages. <b>In</b> this paper, we argue that these outcomes are more likely if ARM borrowers are borrowing constrained, and find that ARM borrowers exhibit characteristics and behavior that are consistent with being borrowing constrained. Although the demographic and financial characteristics of ARM and fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) borrowers are quite similar, ARM borrowers differ from FRM borrowers <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> credit and attitudes towards it. In addition, we find the consumption growth of households with an ARM is more sensitive to past income than the consumption growth of other households, suggesting the ARM borrowers are more likely subject to borrowing constraints that hinder their ability to smooth consumption.
