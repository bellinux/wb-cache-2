50|$|The adult beetles carry {{a bubble}} of air trapped beneath their elytra. This {{allows them to}} dive and swim under well-oxygenated water for {{indefinite}} periods if necessary. The mechanism is sophisticated and amounts to a physical gill. In practice though, their <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptation</b> is for the adults to scavenge and hunt on the water surface, so they seldom stay down for long.

40|$|Hybrid {{zones are}} a {{valuable}} tool for studying the process of speciation and for identifying the genomic regions undergoing divergence and the ecological (extrinsic) and nonecological (intrinsic) factors involved. Here, we explored the genomic and geographic landscape of divergence in a hybrid zone between Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis. Using a genome scan of 28, 417 ddRAD SNPs, we identified genomic regions under possible selection and examined their distribution {{in the context of}} previously identified candidate genes for <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations.</b> We showed that differentiation was genomewide, including multiple candidate genes for <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations,</b> particularly those involved in seasonal adaptation and host plant detoxification. The Z chromosome and four autosomes showed a disproportionate amount of differentiation, suggesting genes on these chromosomes play a potential role in reproductive isolation. Cline analyses of significantly differentiated genomic SNPs, and of species-diagnostic genetic markers, showed a high degree of geographic coincidence (81 %) and concordance (80 %) and were associated with the geographic distribution of a climate-mediated developmental threshold (length of the growing season). A relatively large proportion (1. 3 %) of the outliers for divergent selection were not associated with candidate genes for <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> and may reflect the presence of previously unrecognized intrinsic barriers between these species. These results suggest that exogenous (climate-mediated) and endogenous (unknown) clines may have become coupled and act together to reinforce reproductive isolation. This approach of assessing divergence across both the genomic and geographic landscape can provide insight about the interplay between the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and endogenous and exogenous selection...|$|R
50|$|Aniba is a genus {{of great}} {{ecological}} importance. It currently includes 41 species, classified into six different subgroups, {{in which the}} woody structures are almost undifferentiated, the differences are <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> to different environments over a relatively dry-wet climate.

50|$|The species {{native to}} Madagascar and the Comoro Islands, have {{differences}} resulting from <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> to habitats of {{varying degrees of}} humidity. Species from drier habitats tend to be smaller, or less robust, with sparser foliage and possessing {{a greater number of}} oil glands, with the result that they are more aromatic than species found in wetter habitats. The genus Ravensara has led to endemic species on islands, but not so widespread geographically as in the past.|$|R
5000|$|Ornithologists {{variously}} {{described the}} New Zealand falcon as an aberrant hobby or as allied to three South American species (F. deiroleucus, F. rufigularis, and F. femoralis); however molecular phylogenetic {{studies show that}} Kārearea is most {{closely related to the}} South American Aplomado falcon [...] Two forms are apparent from their significantly different sizes with the larger race in the South Island and the smaller in the North Island. Although neutral genetic markers show a recent history of these two forms, the substantial size difference is likely to be driven by <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Conservation management had already avoided mixing of the North Island (Falco novaeseelandiae ferox) and South Island (Falco novaeseelandiae novaeseelandiae) populations.|$|E
50|$|As greater {{amounts of}} {{scientific}} research in <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptation</b> and natural resource management was conducted, {{it became clear that}} oftentimes, natural systems were subjected to dynamic, transient behaviors that changed how they reacted to significant changes in state variables: rather than work back towards a predetermined equilibrium, the absorbed change was harnessed to establish a new baseline to operate under. Rather than minimizes imposed changes, ecosystems could integrate and manage those changes, and use them fuel the evolution of novel characteristics. This new perspective of resilience as a concept that inherently works synergistically with elements of uncertainty and entropy first began to facilitate changes in the field of adaptive management and environmental resources, through work whose basis was interestingly built by Holling and colleagues yet again.|$|E
50|$|Bert Grof spent large {{time of his}} {{researcher}} life in South America, {{dedicated to}} pasture and forage improvement.

After leaving Brazil in 1992, Grof moved to the Philippines to open a CIAT forages office for Asia and to initiate systematic evaluation of a large set of forage germplasm in South East Asia. In 1994, he returned to Brazil where he continued to work especially on Stylosanthes improvement until 1997, {{when he returned to}} Australia.|$|E
40|$|Bats {{have a high}} species {{diversity}} and show unique ecological traits. The distribution patterns of European bat species differ between species. In this paper we seek to explain which life history traits, or interrelations between traits, can best explain observed differences in the distribution patterns of bats. Traits are interrelated and sometimes involve trade-offs, implying that a change in one trait may have positive or negative consequences for other traits. We describe the main morphological, physiological and <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> of insectivorous European bat species. We make pair-wise relations between traits, indicating the interrelations between traits, in terms of possible trade-offs. We relate the consequences of these trade-offs to the distribution maps of the species, focusing on the traits relevant for southern and northern distribution limits. We found coarse patterns that might indicate the distribution of related species are a consequence of their physiological, morphological and <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> and the interrelations between these adaptations. Hence, we think life-history strategies {{can be used to}} explain differences in species distribution. The method presented in this paper might also be useful for other mammal groups with a high {{species diversity}}, such as Rodentia and Soricidae...|$|R
50|$|Capers can {{be grown}} easily from fresh seeds {{gathered}} from ripe fruit and planted into well-drained seed-raising mix. Seedlings appear in two to four weeks. Old, stored seeds enter a state of dormancy and require cold stratification to germinate. The viable embryos germinate within three to four days after partial removal of the lignified seed coats. The seed coats and the mucilage surrounding the seeds may be <b>ecological</b> <b>adaptations</b> to avoid water loss and conserve seed viability during the dry season.|$|R
