In addition to that the safe use for the whole life-cycle of a substance needs to be demonstrated in a chemical safety report (CSR) as important part of the registration for substances with a yearly volume exceeding 10 tons. If risks are identified in the CSR, the responsible registrants need to propose and apply appropriate measures to adequately control the risks. These measures also need to be recommended to downstream users in the (extended) safety data sheet (Art. 14 (6)). The safety data sheet is also the instrument to communicate registered uses, hazards, risks and appropriate risk management measures within the supply chain.|$|R

30|$|According to Art. 59 (1) REACH all {{identified}} SVHC are {{candidates for}} inclusion in Annex XIV REACH, this candidate status being {{the first step to}} subject a substance to the authorisation scheme. By mid-July 2016 Annex XIV lists 31 substances [10]. Examples of listed SVHC are DEHP and lead chromate [10]. Following Art.  56 (1) REACH a manufacturer, <b>importer</b> or downstream <b>user</b> shall not place an Annex XIV substance on the market for use or use it himself, unless this use is exempt from the authorisation requirement or the actor, or his supplier, respectively, attained an authorisation for the corresponding use. The authorisation scheme thus establishes a use specific ban that is effective from a specified sunset date with permit reservation: by applying for authorisation actors may temporarily—according to Art. 60 (8) REACH every authorisation decision is subject to review—overcome the barrier of the ban. For this they must, prior to the placing on the market or usage, prove that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks [11].|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} new chemicals {{policy of the}} European Community, REACH, is an important new development in environmental protection. Rather than waiting for government or independent researchers to determine that chemicals are hazardous, it will make manufacturers, <b>importers,</b> and professional <b>users</b> of chemicals responsible for the safe use. There {{is little doubt that}} REACH will give health and environmental benefits, but there has been little agreement about the resulting costs: -Will European manufacturers be crushed by the economic burden of chemicals regulation, as some industry sources have suggested? -Or, as projected in some public sector studies, will there be a minor cost impact, well within the ability of industry and worth the price? This report offers a new look at these costs. Frank Ackerman and Rachel Massey compare the current EC legislation on chemicals, the European Commission’s proposal and an alternative proposal addressing previous versions of REACH. The authors make a bottom-up calculation of the expected registration and testing costs under REACH and provide a new analysis of the indirect economic impacts.

30|$|The European chemicals’ {{regulation}} REACH 1907 / 2006 /EC (REACH Regulation) [1] is {{an important}} driver {{on the way to}} the ambitious goal of a ‘non-toxic environment’: the seventh environment action programme mandates the European Commission to develop by 2018 “a Union strategy for a non-toxic environment that is conducive to innovation and the development of sustainable substitutes including non-chemical solutions” [2, 3]. One element for achieving this goal is the provision set-up for substances of very high concern (SVHC) in the REACH Regulation. According to Art. 33 (2) [1], consumers have the right to receive information from the suppliers of an article about the presence of any SVHC in the article, its subassemblies, or its packaging above a threshold of 0.1 % (weight/weight) upon request. Information shall be provided within a time period of 45  days free of charge. SVHCs are chemicals which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and toxic for reproduction or very critical for the environment [because they are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB)] or which cause concern for other reasons such as endocrine disruptors ([1] Art. 57). They are listed in the so-called candidate list [4] which is updated twice a year (last update 01 / 2018 with a total of 181 entries). These substances are candidates for inclusion in Annex XIV, which is the list of substances subject to authorization (Art. 56, 58) [1]. Authorization means that a manufacturer, <b>importer,</b> or downstream <b>user</b> shall not place a substance on the market, if that substance is included in Annex XIV, unless the special use has been authorized according to the provisions laid down in Art. 60 – 64 or the substance is exempted from authorization (Art. 56).|$|R
40|$|A {{screening}} for persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons {{was carried out}} in December 1995 in the main coastal lagoons on the Pacific side of Nicaragua, where most of the country’s agriculture and pesticide use has been taking place for decades. Results {{for a wide range of}} organochlorine pesticides in lagoon sediments show levels that generally were very low in Estero Real, Estero Padre Ramos, and estuary of San Juan del Sur. For example, total DDTs in these lagoons averaged 4. 5 6 3. 4 ng g 21 dry weight, which may be considered a baseline level for the region. Other compounds such as HCHs, BHC, endosulfan, heptachlor, endrin, toxaphene, and aroclors were present in concentrations even lower, generally below 1 ng g 21 dry weight. However, sediments of the Esteros Naranjo–Paso Caballos system at Chinandega district contained pesticide residues in much higher levels, attaining maximum values of 1, 420 ng g 21 and 270 ng g 21 dry weight, respectively, for toxaphene and total DDTs. Other compounds such as aroclors, chlordane, endosulfan, and dieldrin were also present in the sediments of this lagoon system, but in lower concentrations. The very high concentrations of toxaphene and DDTs in this lagoon are a result of the intensive use of these pesticides in cotton growing in the district of Chinandega. Due to the long environmental half-lives of these compounds (t 1 ⁄ 2. 10 years in temperate soils), their concentrations in lagoon sediments will likely remain high for years to come. Based on these results, the development of the new shrimp farming activities in the Pacific coastal lagoons should be restricted to selected areas. The intensive use of pesticides in Nicaragua, which for decades has been one of the biggest pesticide <b>importers</b> and <b>users</b> in Central America (Appel 1991; Castillo et al. 1997), is likely to cause severe contamination of aquatic systems. In particular halogenated hydrocarbons, including chlorinated pesticides and industrial chemicals such as the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are lipophilic toxic compounds that bioaccumulate and transfer in the food chain. Introduced in aquatic environments these chemicals may compromise the health of the ecosystems (Tardiff 1991). This is the case for the coastal lagoons of the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, where most of the country’s agriculture and population have been concentrated. In particular, cotton growing, a pesticide intensive agriculture started in the 1950 s, was developed in this region of Nicaragua (Appel 1991). The degradation of these coastal lagoon systems, especially the reduction of mangrove forest and overexploitation of fishery resources, has received focused attention from national authorities. Agrochemical residues are suspected in the degradation of these lagoons, but have not been investigated. Furthermore, with the plans for developing shrimp rearing farms in these coastal lagoons (esteros), contamination by agrochemical residues becomes a matter of much concern for the future of this industry. To provide information on the potential impacts from agriculture and urban development, a screening of the contaminants {{was carried out in}} the main lagoons of the Pacific coast. This paper presents the results of the analyses of chlorinated hydrocarbons in lagoon sediments and discusses the ecotoxicological hazard posed by the current levels of persistent pesticide residues to aquatic biota...|$|R
50|$|Information {{disclosure}} {{gives an}} opportunity to the public to immediately react and avoid exposure to potential chemical hazards and risks for example by changing consumer behavior or applying pressure on the chemical firms etc. In the other hand, information disclosure also can motivate firms to search for safer alternatives. TSCA allows companies to claim their precise chemical volumes, components, chemical uses, and essentially any information provided to the EPA as business confidential except in the cases that chemical need health and safety studies. In this extent of TSCA, the EPA’ s ability is restricted to share information including the company’s identities, the chemical’s structures to any public groups except the designated contractors, or to law enforcement officials. It {{is important that the}} state and local environmental non-governmental agencies, environmental advocates and other public groups in obtaining chemical information in order to develop contingency plans and effective emergency responses in cases of highly toxic exposures. However, the EPA can only disclose confidential business information when it determines such disclosure is necessary to protect human health or the environment from an unreasonable risk. Similar to TSCA, REACH mandates chemical companies to disclosure of health and safety information that allows public to have an access to the basic chemical information, including brief profiles of hazardous properties, authorized uses, and risk management measures. Also one of the main strength of REACH is in {{the extent to which the}} government intends to make the public receive as much as information possible, including identification of substances of a very high concern that are subject to authorization. REACH considers the full chemical composition, the preparation, the precise use, the detailed function or application of the chemical, the precise tonnage or volume of the chemical manufactured or placed on the market and the relationships between manufacturers, <b>importers</b> and downstream <b>users</b> as confidential for the industry’s economic purpose. PBTs (Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances) and vPvB (Very Persistent and Very Bioaccumulative and Toxic Substances), and other chemicals that are classified as dangerous, REACH requires firms to submit safety data sheet. Therefore, the downstream users, manufacturers, retailers and importers will have the information they need to safely use and handle the chemicals. Unlike TSCA, REACH can share the firm’s chemical information with state, government authorities and EU organizations under an agreement between the firm and the other responsible parties.|$|R
40|$|New {{protections for}} {{intellectual}} property owners sit oddly {{in a free}} trade agreement, argues Mike Willis, and will work against Australia’s interests CHAPTER 17 of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, dedicated to intellectual property, is the largest substantive chapter in the agreement. Spanning some 29 pages, it consists of twelve Articles and 96 subsections, not to mention three side letters relating to intellectual property. This compares with 23 pages on government procurement, 16 on financial services, 14 on investment, 12 pages on telecommunications, and only eight pages specifically on agriculture. So why did several of these areas of the economy attract so much attention in the media {{over the course of}} the AUSFTA negotiations while discussion about intellectual property barely registered a mention. Let us be very clear about some of the more significant implications and likely impact of the intellectual property provisions of the AUSFTA. First, the provisions are significant because they take further and deeper the ongoing alignment of much of Australian intellectual property law with that of the US. Nowhere has the apparent desire of Australian governments for uniformity and alignment with the US been more dramatic than in the area of pharmaceuticals, covering patent and related sui generis legal regimes. It has applied to both substantive US patent law and to much of US patent practice and procedure and has been proceeding for some time. The point should not be lost: Australian governments of both main political persuasions have, over recent years, made decisions to lift IP protection levels which privilege intellectual property owners over local <b>users,</b> <b>importers</b> or consumers, especially of medicines. These decisions, in themselves, have significantly benefited foreign pharmaceutical companies and added considerably to the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. In large measure, the AUSFTA reflects more of that same drift of harmonisation. Secondly, reflecting the deeper integration with the US, several of the AUSFTA provisions very clearly mark out Australia’s compliance with US versions of interpretation, clarification, definition and ‘improvement’ of very contentious patent law and administrative practice. This extends to greater legalisation of the way in which much of patent law is operationalised as well as the incorporation into Australian practice of US legal terminology. This will have implications both domestically and internationally for Australia. Some of these AUSFTA provisions are the subject of current inquiries in Australia. Some of them are currently being debated multilaterally in international forums and are viewed by others as best resolved multilaterally rather than bilaterally. Australia’s acquiescence and pre-emption is very likely to constrain its future negotiating options. Thirdly, the AUSFTA reflects the capitulation by Australia to the pharmaceutical lobby’s long sought after linkage between the market approval process, regulated by the pharmaceutical approval authority, and patent expiry which is administered by the patent regulatory body, IP Australia. The lobby has persistently sought such a linkage as it protects brand-name companies beyond their existing intellectual property rights by providing a means to stay the approval of generic pharmaceuticals. It is widely believed amongst health groups that such linkage is likely to lead to unjustified patent extensions, the denying of approval to generic manufacturers and delays in access to lower-priced equally effective, generic medicines. In the US, the linkage has been the subject of considerable abuse and investigation. Of course, there’s no requirement under Australia’s international obligations for any such linkage and the EU, for example, has no linkage. Major US pharmaceutical interests have applauded the provisions. It approaches an absurdity to conclude anything else but that further delays in the entry of generic pharmaceuticals onto the Australian pharmaceutical market will occur. This is also likely to have significant cost implications for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Finally, it tends not to be well understood that, unlike trade concessions granted by Australia in other economic areas covered by the AUSFTA, the concessions afforded US IP owners and exporters cannot be confined merely to the US. Under Australia’s international obligations, any advantage or favour with respect to the protection of intellectual property given by a WTO member to nationals of any other country, with limited exceptions, must be extended ‘immediately and unconditionally’ to the nationals of all other members. The principle obliges Australia to extend any intellectual property benefits obtained under the AUSFTA by the US to all other WTO members. This is likely to have major cost implications well beyond the scope merely of the AUSFTA. IT SHOULD come as no surprise that intellectual property constituted the largest substantive chapter of the agreement. From a US perspective, intellectual property was always going to be one of the paramount issues on the negotiating table. Intellectual property protection is explicitly stipulated for under US trade law as a principal negotiating objective in all US bilateral trading agreements. This reflects the huge economic influence of US multinational interests in pharmaceuticals, software, entertainment and publishing. Of course, it tends to be overlooked that, while trade liberalisation is generally associated with pressure from corporate interests for less regulation in most areas of the economy, intellectual property work in the opposite direction. The reason of course should be pretty clear. It is a fact of geo-political life that the economic privileges that attach to intellectual property rights now accrue overwhelmingly to large corporate interests - not individuals. The largest users of the patent system, for example, are chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Both patent and copyright law confer huge benefits on some and significant costs on others. China, for example, is reportedly paying in excess of US$ 5 billion a year in patent licence fees to gain access to technology. With around 90 per cent of patents registered in Australia being foreign-owned, one wonders about the comparable dollar amount here, who’s bearing the cost and what the implications of that might be. Like most areas of regulation, intellectual property law is redistributive. As a result it is inescapably political. It advances particular interests over those of others. It allocates costs and benefits within a society. It advances the interests of owners, especially exporters, over those of <b>users,</b> <b>importers</b> and consumers. At a broader level, intellectual property law - and the legal and regulatory framework which surrounds it - authorises and legitimates political choices. In 1998 Australia passed legislation allowing an extension of the patent term to a total of 25 years for patents relating to pharmaceuticals. It attracted the support of all parties. The rationale given for the change was that pharmaceutical companies needed to be compensated for delays in regulatory approval of their products. It should be noted that the parliamentary debate which accompanied the passage of the legislation was distinguished by its ignorance of IP law and related issues. Significantly, that decision was of Australia’s choosing. There’s no requirement under Australia’s international intellectual property obligations to have a patent extension scheme. Canada has resisted an extension scheme. In Australia the scheme has been of clear benefit to foreign pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, it has also added significantly to PBS costs and, according to the Productivity Commission, constituted a costly barrier to Australian exports of generic medicines. Of course, intellectual property rights are not conferred in a vacuum. These rights - more usefully viewed as privileges - are not god-given; they are instruments of public policy conferred by the state via the workings of a legal and regulatory regime. Despite the efforts of large corporate interests or captive government agencies to depict them as such, they are not mere ‘items of tradeable property’. The reason a state constructs such privileges is their supposed contribution to the greater public good. The state confers on an intellectual property owner what are essentially monopoly privileges to exploit a created product or invention - always with conditions - in exchange for the community potentially benefiting from that innovation. Quite apart from its relationship to trade, IP law has enormous social, health and cultural as well as economic implications. The Australian Law Reform Commission, for example, has been examining the extent to which intellectual property owners are unreasonably restricting the use of patented material or technology in Australia. It’s a matter of considerable concern and more than academic interest that intellectual property rights and the legal and regulatory framework which both defines those rights and governs their use is rarely the subject of critical political or media debate in Australia. Greater scrutiny is clearly needed as to which actors are determining how intellectual property law develops in Australia, what purpose the law is serving and whose interests and values it reflects.
