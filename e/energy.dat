5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the <b>energy</b> payback time, is the <b>energy</b> returned on <b>energy</b> invested (EROEI) or <b>energy</b> return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the <b>energy</b> required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local <b>energy</b> prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough <b>energy</b> over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular <b>energy</b> level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher <b>energy</b> level by absorbing a photon with sufficient <b>energy</b> to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher <b>energy</b> state can drop to a lower <b>energy</b> state while radiating the excess <b>energy</b> as a photon. These characteristic <b>energy</b> values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
40|$|Electron binding <b>energies</b> {{in neutral}} atoms have been {{calculated}} relativistically, with {{the requirement of}} complete relaxation. Hartree-Fock-Slater wave functions served as zeroth-order eigenfunctions to compute the expectation of the total Hamiltonian. A first-order correction to the local approximation was thus included. Quantum-electrodynamic corrections were made. For all elements with atomic numbers ranging from 2 to 106, the following quantities are listed: total <b>energies,</b> electron kinetic <b>energies,</b> electron-nucleus potential <b>energies,</b> electron-electron potential <b>energies</b> consisting of electrostatic and Breit interaction (magnetic and retardation) terms, and vacuum polarization <b>energies.</b> Binding <b>energies</b> including relaxation are listed for all electrons in all atoms over the indicated range of atomic numbers.

40|$|The linear finite {{difference}} Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) {{equation is}} applied to the calculation of the electrostatic binding free <b>energies</b> of a group of inhibitors to the Neuraminidase enzyme. An ensemble of enzyme-inhibitor complex conformations was generated using Monte Carlo simulations and the electrostatic binding free <b>energies</b> of subtly different configurations of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were calculated. It was seen that the binding free <b>energies</b> calculated using FDPB depend strongly on the configuration of the complex taken from the ensemble. This configurational dependence was investigated in detail in the electrostatic hydration free <b>energies</b> of the inhibitors. Differences in hydration <b>energies</b> of up to 7 kcal mol(- 1) were obtained for root mean square (RMS) structural deviations of only 0. 5 Angstrom. To verify the result, the grid size and parameter dependence of the calculated hydration free <b>energies</b> were systematically investigated. This showed that the absolute hydration free <b>energies</b> calculated using the FDPB equation were very sensitive to the values of key parameters, but that the configurational dependence of the free <b>energies</b> was independent of the parameters chosen. Thus just as molecular mechanics <b>energies</b> are very sensitive to configuration, and single-structure values are not typically used to score binding free <b>energies,</b> single FDPB <b>energies</b> should be treated with the same caution...|$|R

5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper <b>energy</b> can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching <b>energy</b> level.
