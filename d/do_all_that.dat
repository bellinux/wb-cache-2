25|$|In 1788, the British Committee for the Abolition of Slavery sent a Swedish {{opponent}} of the slave trade, Anders Sparrman, to Gustav III. The committee feared that other nations would expand their trade if Britain stopped its own. They sent books about the issue and a letter, in which the king was encouraged to hinder his subjects {{to participate in this}} disgraceful trade. In the response letter, delivered through Sparrman, he wrote {{that no one in the}} country had participated in the slave trade and that he would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he could to keep them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|While the Continental Army camped at Newburgh, New York in {{the winter}} of 17821783, the army's {{situation}} neared a crisis. With the war all but won, officers and soldiers realized that they needed to get Congress to give them their back-pay before the army was disbanded. Meanwhile, one faction in Congress wanted the army dissolved in order to reduce expenses and return power to the states. Another faction wanted to use the army as a lever to push through higher taxes and a stronger central government. Washington was sympathetic with his officers but was afraid of the consequences of a large-scale mutiny. He notified Congress that he would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he could to stop the army from rebelling.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols {{carefully}} scouted out and {{spied on}} their enemies {{in advance of}} any invasion. Prior to the invasion of Europe, Batu and Subutai sent spies for almost ten years {{into the heart of}} Europe, making maps of the old Roman roads, establishing trade routes, and determining the level of ability of each principality to resist invasion. They made well-educated guesses as to the willingness of each principality to aid the others, and their ability to resist alone or together. Also, when invading an area, the Mongols would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was necessary to completely conquer the town or cities. Some tactics involved diverting rivers from the city/town , closing supplies to the city and waiting for its inhabitants to surrender, gathering civilians from the nearby areas to fill the front line for the city/town attack before scaling the wall, and pillaging the surrounding area and killing some of the people, then letting some survivors flee to the main city to report their losses to the main populace to weaken resistance, simultaneously draining the resources of the city with the sudden influx of refugees.|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{flew back}} to Washington, D.C. from his {{vacation}} at Martha's Vineyard, speaking with legislators from Air Force One, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and Sharif from the White House. Clinton announced the attacks in a TV address, saying the Khost camp was [...] "one {{of the most active}} terrorist bases in the world." [...] He emphasized that [...] "Our battle against terrorism... will require strength, courage and endurance. We will not yield to this threat... We must be prepared to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> we can for as long as we must." [...] Clinton also cited [...] "compelling evidence that [...] was planning to mount further attacks" [...] in his rationale for Operation Infinite Reach.|$|E

We have been unable to supply all who have come forward and entered their names as members of the Society, having been entirely out of thread for {{the last two or three}} weeks. [...] But we have now on hand enough for eighty or ninety pair of socks, and we hope those interested in the matter will come forward now and assist us in getting them done as early as possible.

500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that I did the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride that I did <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> stuff for which I got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E

500|$|On 30 June, the [...] "Immortal Seven" [...] {{secretly}} requested William—then in the Dutch Republic with Mary—to come to England with an army to depose James. William {{had made}} known earlier that a military intervention, {{for which he}} had been assembling forces, would be conditional on such an invitation. At first, William was still reluctant; possibly he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was. According to Gilbert Burnet, however, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him [...] "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> lay in her power to make him King for life". She would, she assured him, always obey her husband as she had promised to do in her marriage vows.|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like you can <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She {{also noted that the}} album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had to answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place I should <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he has done and I should <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> I know he has in mind to do'.|$|E

The film was eventually broadcast by Channel Nine at 10:30 pm on Saturday, 3 February 2007. Downs reported that [...] "it didn't <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> well".
