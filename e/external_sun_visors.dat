5000|$|Starting in 1924, {{automobiles}} {{such as the}} Ford Model T {{began to}} include an exterior <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> on its closed body versions. Other early automobiles also had externally attached <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> to their windshields until 1931, when interior mounts were introduced. As automobile design advanced with windshields mounted on an angle to lessen wind resistance, the outside or [...] "cadet-type" [...] <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> were no longer seen on cars starting from 1932. Henceforth, <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> were mounted inside the vehicle, making the hinged flap easier to reach and adjust. Some were made of green mica.|$|R
40|$|A <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> {{has been}} used only {{for the purpose of}} {{interrupting}} direct sunshine. Investigation, therefore, has not been made to be on the feeling of touch of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor.</b> In this study, the feeling of touch of <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> installed in the present automobile was investigated. To clarify the relation between the sense of touch and the mechanical and physical quantity of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> prototype products of the <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> of the same shape were made. Surface characteristics and cold feel characteristic of materials were measured by the KES system. In addition, we investigated the relation between the surface property and the sense of touch of various materials. The correlation between favorability and WC, RC, SMD was high on the <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> prototype. As a result, it was clarified that materials whose surfaces were very smooth and soft were favorable. Those materials consist of leather and moquette. Conversely, the material sensed hard was not favorable. The relation between the mechanical and the physica...|$|R

5000|$|Padded {{dashboard}} and <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> (the padding was {{advertised as}} being more absorbent than foam rubber.) The instruments were recessed to minimize injury potential.|$|R
50|$|The Santa Fe {{received}} its final facelift for 2005. Changes {{were made to}} the grille, taillights, rear bumper, interior instrument cluster. The instrument cluster was redesigned with the speedometer now reading 140 mph (earlier models only indicated 130 mph) and a better-designed toll ticket slot in the driver's <b>sun</b> <b>visor.</b> Both <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> also received extensions so the sun could be blocked out better when coming in from the side. The base Santa Fe was discontinued that time, making way for the Tucson.|$|R
50|$|Various versions:Standard Equipment:air conditioning, power windows, 3-point seat belt, <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> front stabilizer, front {{laminated}} glass, side-toughened glass, halogen head lamps, soft top, steel wheels.|$|R

50|$|In 1987, Toyota {{introduced}} the Tercel EZ with less standard equipment: vinyl upholstery, a four-speed manual transmission, rubber mats instead of carpeting, and a deleted passenger's side <b>sun</b> <b>visor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most modern {{cars have}} two <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> {{one for the}} driver's side and a second for the passenger's side, with the {{rear-view}} mirror often mounted in between the two <b>sun</b> <b>visors.</b> Each visor can be lowered to help block light from the sun entering through the windshield. Some are designed {{so they can be}} released from one bracket and be turned towards the side window, covering {{a small part of the}} window at the top to block sunlight shining onto the side of the face. Some current visors can also be extended along the side window to block sunlight all of the way to the [...] "B" [...] pillar to block the light for the driver or passenger.|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{addition to}} the 1200s in 1961 was a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> to help reduce glare. As they became due for heavy overhauls in the late 1970s, they were withdrawn.|$|R
50|$|In early 1937 the de luxe model PV52 was introduced. The {{equipment}} list included twin <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> twin windscreen wipers, a watch, a heater and armrests {{on all four}} doors.|$|R
50|$|The 182 Cup {{lacked the}} {{automatic}} Xenon headlights and headlight washer jets, climate control (rear footwell heater vents were also removed), illuminated <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> Solar Reflective Windscreen and Automatic Wipers.|$|R
50|$|The deluxe version had a heater, leather seat facings, carpets {{replacing}} the standard rubber matting, armrests on the doors, twin-tone horns, a passenger <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> and some extra chrome, including overriders.|$|R
50|$|A sports visor — {{also called}} a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> or visor cap — {{is a type}} of crownless hat {{consisting}} simply of a visor or brim with a strap encircling the head. The top of the head is not covered and the visor protects only the face, including eyes, nose, and cheeks, from the sun.|$|R
50|$|Ambulent vendors {{registered}} as exhibitors and stalls were well-prepared and kept more stock of bottled mineral water, energy drinks, soft drinks, and other beverages in supply. Many also sold <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> caps, sunglasses, and fans.|$|R
50|$|The body {{structure}} {{was designed by}} T.K. Garrett, who had been an aeronautical engineer before joining Austin. It was of fully stressed monocoque chassis-less construction, which made it lighter and stiffer than most contemporary vehicles, the first Austin {{to be made in}} this way. Inside there were individual seats at the front and a bench at the rear covered in PVC with an option of leather facings on the seats. Evidence of economy was seen in only having a single windscreen wiper, central combined stop/tail/numberplate lamp and a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> in front of the driver only. A passenger-side wiper and <b>sun</b> <b>visor,</b> and a heater were available as optional extras.|$|R
5000|$|The {{range was}} {{gradually}} introduced in Australia from May 1973. The 15TS and 17TL were initially available with the 17TS being promised {{later in the}} year. These 1973 model year vehicles contained several unique features, the stick-on mirror and <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> from the Renault 12 to comply with regulations ("ADR"). The <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> retaining catch on these models was never used and available only in Australia. The instrument panel [...] "verandah" [...] was fitted to reduce glare and was only fitted to Australian, North American and Scandinavian versions. Sales of these early models was slow in Australia due to their relatively high price, and continued through to late 1974.|$|R
50|$|The jamboree's mascot is a {{porcupine}} called Toucs. He {{is depicted}} in a cartoon style with blue spines and is wearing a scout uniform of shorts, shirt, neckerchief with woggle, along with wristband, sandals, <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> and sunglasses.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 model {{added a new}} easier-to-fold/open soft top, {{standard}} UConnect infotainment {{systems on}} models equipped with the MyGig radio, and new <b>sun</b> <b>visors</b> that offer more coverage than the old models, as well as integrated vanity mirrors.|$|R
50|$|Both {{standard}} and de-luxe versions were offered. The de-luxe package included a heater, manual screen washer, twin <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> twin horns, bumper over-riders, a clock and leather-covered seat. A two-tone paint scheme and a radio were available as options.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 ANSI {{allowed the}} {{development}} of a ventilated hard hat to keep wearers cooler. Accessories such as face shields, <b>sun</b> <b>visors,</b> earmuffs, and perspiration-absorbing lining cloths could also be used; today, attachments include radios, walkie-talkies, pagers, and cameras.|$|R
50|$|They {{were used}} on ore {{traffic on the}} Great Northern line, and on general freight on the North Coast and Southern lines. A {{characteristic}} addition to the 1250 class in 1961 was a <b>sun</b> <b>visor</b> to help reduce glare.|$|R
