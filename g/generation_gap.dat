25|$|Barry and Enright's careers {{went into}} eclipse after the scandal broke, though Barry did get some hosting and acting gigs and briefly collaborated on {{projects}} with game show packager Goodson-Todman Productions. Barry purchased {{a radio station}} in Redondo Beach, California, and in 1969 {{he made his first}} network comeback as an emcee, replacing Dennis Wholey on a short-lived prime-time game, The <b>Generation</b> <b>Gap</b> on ABC. Two years later he sold his first post-scandal game show, also to ABC, called The Reel Game, which he emceed as well.|$|E
25|$|The show {{captured}} a key feature of Britain in the 1960s—the widening <b>generation</b> <b>gap.</b> Alf (and {{to a lesser}} degree his wife) represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The same things were anathema to Alf—and indicative of everything that was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.|$|E

25|$|Adhering to the {{official}} cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down, but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium and {{a seat on the}} republican Council of State. In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the <b>generation</b> <b>gap,</b> alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published Sociologia succesului ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym Traian Hariton.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} led to {{controversy and}} criticism {{from a number}} of media sources, including The Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, Fox News, The San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times, CNN and The Boston Herald, some of which ridiculed the city's response to the devices as disproportionate and indicative of a <b>generation</b> <b>gap</b> between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a younger staffer at Mayor Thomas Menino's office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures as cartoon characters from the TV show.|$|E
25|$|Social {{activism}} {{had existed}} in Eugene {{prior to the}} mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of deeply held social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People angry about the Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening <b>generation</b> <b>gap.</b> When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall {{seemed like a good}} waiting room for the next concert.

25|$|Although he {{went through}} a {{difficult}} five-year period (according to an interview with TV Guide {{before his death in}} 1984), Barry moved to Los Angeles, eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in TV Guide that, in order to determine if he still had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to have a license with the FCC), he raised money to buy a Redondo Beach radio station. Barry returned to hosting with The <b>Generation</b> <b>Gap</b> in 1969 and had success with The Joker's Wild, which premiered in 1972. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated Tic-Tac-Dough (which Barry did not host) and Joker (which he did) in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals.|$|E
25|$|By 1899, Junimea {{was again}} merged into the Conservative Party. That year, Catargiu died, leaving open {{the issue of}} his {{succession}} to the Conservative Chairmanship. Carp {{took part in the}} subsequent race, but lost to Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, who probably received decisive support from King Carol. During the election, Carp found himself a new adversary, in the person of Take Ionescu. This highly popular and young Conservative, who preserved strong links with the PNL, helped swing the vote in favor of Cantacuzino. Carp sincerely believed that Ionescu was a problem for the Conservative Party, and stated that his major goal was proving to the world that Ionescu was not a genuine politician. He was especially vexed by Ionescu's indifference to an unwritten law, according to which the King had an ultimate say in foreign policies. Carp's influence was also being contested by the new current formed around the Conservative Study Circle. Through its speakers Filipescu and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, the Circle began analyzing the need for complex electoral reforms. Filipescu admired the senior leader, but Carp felt that the <b>generation</b> <b>gap</b> was unbridgeable.|$|E

Captain America, upon learning of Hank's violence, tracks down and beats Hank unconscious for Janet. Captain America's visits Janet after the fight left her exasperated and angry, stemming from embarrassment of her personal life now being public. After stopping the Chitauri invasion, Captain America and Wasp reconcile as friends and slowly start dating, despite Hank's {{attempts at}} making amends. On one of their secret meetings, Janet later confesses to Hank, now classified as a security risk by S.H.I.E.L.D., that the <b>generation</b> <b>gap</b> between Captain America and herself, along with the elderly status of Steve's friends, put a large strain on their relationship.

40|$|There is much {{enthusiastic}} {{debate on}} the topic of <b>generation</b> <b>gaps</b> in the workplace today; what the generational differences are, how to address the apparent challenges, and if the generations themselves are even real. Despite the frenzy, however, there has been relatively limited empirical research performed on this issue; in particular, no empirical research {{in the context of an}} engineering organization seems to have been performed. With that in mind, the main intent of the thesis is to determine the existence of generational differences among engineers in a large, technical organization, and discuss the potential implications of the findings. Extensive literature research and analysis identified communication techniques, leadership preferences, learning styles, and work motivation to be the key hypothesized differences most pertinent to an engineering organization. A questionnaire was put together based on these differences and distributed to a sample that consisted of approximately eighty members from each of the four generations: Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, Millennials.

Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson described youth subcultures as symbolic or ritualistic attempts to resist the power of bourgeois hegemony by consciously adopting behavior that appears threatening to the establishment. Conversely, Marxists of the Frankfurt School of social studies argue that youth culture is inherently consumerist and integral to the divide-and-rule strategy of capitalism.

[...] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too." [...] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars. James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as [...] "the finest animated movie ever made", writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation." [...] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film [...] "A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right."
