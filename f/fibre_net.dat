50|$|Along with Camillo Golgi, {{he was a}} major {{proponent of}} the reticular theory that the brain's nervous system {{consisted}} of processes of contiguous cells fused to create a massive meshed network. Gerlach summed up his theory by stating:the finest divisions of the protoplasmic processes ultimately {{take part in the}} formation of the fine nerve fibre network which I consider to be an essential constituent of the gray matter of the spinal cord. The divisions are none other than the beginnings of this nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>net.</b> The cells of the gray matter are therefore doubly connected by means the nerve process which becomes the axis fibre and through the finest branches of the protoplasmic processes which become a part of the fine nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>net</b> of the gray matter. The reticular theory predominated until the 1890s when Ramon y Cajal brought forth his neuron doctrine of synaptic junctions, which in essence replaced the reticular theory.|$|E

40|$|Fibre-reinforced {{composite}} materials have gained an increasing success, mostly for strengthening, retrofitting, and repairing existing structures. However some problems may arise {{with the use}} of traditional FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer), particularly when the compatibility with the substrate and the reversibility of the intervention are required, as in case of cultural heritage buildings, or specific exposition conditions may compromise the long term effectiveness of the reinforcement, as in presence of high temperature and humidity. Starting from these considerations new {{composite materials}} are emerging as a more effective solution in certain fields of application and under specific service conditions; in this context, mortar-based composite systems, consisting of one or more layers of uni- or bi-directional <b>fibre</b> <b>nets</b> embedded in cement/lime-based matrix layers, can be used as reinforcement of both concrete and masonry structures. However, the research work dealing with these emerging materials and their performances when used as a strengthening system for existing structures is still limited.

Indeed the trend in mechanical properties correlates well with calorimetric characterizations performed on these glasses.
