While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army Reserve is a {{collective}} name {{given to the}} reserve units of the Australian Army. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, the reserve military force has been known by many names, including the Citizens Forces, the Citizen Military Forces, the Militia and, unofficially, the Australian Military Forces. In 1980, however, the current name—Australian Army Reserve—was officially adopted, and it now consists {{of a number of}} components based around the level of commitment and training obligation that <b>its</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> required to meet.|$|E

5|$|The Azorov {{government}} {{stated that}} it will fight corruption. However several of <b>its</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> assigned to two or more government positions, and, of course, are paid for them. That fact reflects direct disregard for the Constitution of Ukraine. Some of the members do not even qualify to the assigned positions either as in case with Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy who {{was elected to the}} Supreme Council of Justice. Some {{of the members of the}} government received their government assignments without a basic knowledge of the state language as in case with the Minister of Internal Affairs Mohyliov. The President Yanukovych gave him two months (until August 2010) to learn the language.|$|E
5|$|The BJP is the world's largest {{political}} party by primary membership, having 100 million registered members as of April 2015. The organisation of the BJP is strictly hierarchical, {{with the president}} being the highest authority in the party. Until 2012, the BJP constitution mandated that any qualified member could be national or state president for a single three-year term. This was amended {{to a maximum of}} two consecutive terms. Below the president is the national executive, which contains a variable number of senior leaders from across the country. It is the higher decision making body of the party. <b>Its</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> several vice-presidents, general-secretaries, treasurers and secretaries, who work directly with the president. An identical structure, with an executive committee led by a president, exists at the state, regional, district and local level.|$|E
5|$|The {{starling}} family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between <b>its</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E

While the band is acclaimed for its large catalog of hits, with over 300 songs composed since 1972, <b>its</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> also admired for their commitment to live the message of solidarity for national development that features in most of their music. Each band member has gone on to cultivate a primary career in addition to his participation in Mahaleo in areas ranging from medical care and sociology to farming and politics. The band has collectively launched two development initiatives, in addition to numerous other activities managed by individual members of the group.|$|E
