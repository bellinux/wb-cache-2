One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
500|$|Although Eugenides sought {{expert advice}} about intersex, sexology, and the {{formation}} of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex people, saying, [...] " [...] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried to pretend that I had this [...] and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> through this as much as I could". Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an [...] "elusive historical figure". He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University's medical library.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} broadcast on the BBC 4 radio programme The Human Button, Callaghan {{became the only}} Prime Minister to go on record with his opinion on ordering a retaliation {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack on the United Kingdom:If it were to become necessary or vital, it would have meant the deterrent had failed, because the value of the nuclear weapon is frankly only as a deterrent," [...] he said. [...] "But if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt, necessary to do it, then I would have done it. I've had terrible doubts, of course, about this. I say to you, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> after having pressed that button, I could never, ever have forgiven myself.|$|E
2500|$|All {{relevant}} {{former prime}} ministers have supported an [...] "independent nuclear deterrent", including David Cameron and the incumbent Prime Minister Theresa May. Only one former Prime Minister, Lord Callaghan, has given any insight on his orders: Callaghan stated that, although {{in a situation}} where nuclear weapon use was required – and thus the whole purpose and value of the weapon as a deterrent had failed – he would have ordered use of nuclear weapons, if needed: ...if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt it was necessary to do it, then I would have done it (used the weapon)...but if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> after pressing that button, I could have never forgiven myself. Lord Healey, Secretary of State for Defence and [...] "alternate decision-taker" [...] under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, said that in the event of Soviet nuclear weapons attacking the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister had been killed or incapacitated, he would not have ordered a retaliation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, The Kolkata Telegraph {{reported}} that director Rituparno Ghosh wanted to cast Chakraverti {{in a film}} based on a case the Wiccan had encountered while practicing the craft. Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evil– A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, she came down to Delhi and lived with me for a while. I showed her how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E
