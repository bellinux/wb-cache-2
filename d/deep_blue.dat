5|$|Released {{in theaters}} during the film industry's summer season, <b>Deep</b> <b>Blue</b> Sea was a {{moderate}} commercial success, grossing more than $73 {{million in the}} United States and Canada, and $164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions.

5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows <b>Deep</b> <b>Blue</b> as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six.

To keep the true identity of <b>Deep</b> <b>Blue</b> a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). <b>Deep</b> <b>Blue</b> {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
