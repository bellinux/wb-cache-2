40|$|Abstract- This thesis {{attempts}} to present numerical simulation of solar collector developed exclusively for grape drying. Solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> is much feasible technically and economically. There {{has been a}} remarkable achievement in solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> due to sustained research and development associated with the adoption of advanced technologies. Simulation is an important tool for design and operation control. For the designer of a drying system, simulation {{makes it possible to}} find the optimum design and operating parameters. For the designer of the control system, simulation provides a means to device control strategies and to analyze the effects of disturbances. In the present thesis the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool has been used to simulate the solar collector for better understanding the heat transfer capability. 3 D model of the collector involving air inlet, wavy structured absorber plate,glass cover plate, and pebble block is modeled by ANSYS Workbench and the unstructured grid was created in ANSYS ICEM. The results were obtained by using ANSYS FLUENT software. The objective of this work is to compare theoretically and experimentally work done with the work done by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool with respect to flow and temperature distribution inside the solar collector. The outlet temperature of air is compared with experimental results and there is a good agreement in between the...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} simulate solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> integrating heat and mass transfer models solved by an explicit finite differences method, considering changing boundary conditions. The model simultaneously incorporated shrinkage of the product, changes in effective moisture diffusivity and dependence of thermal properties on water content and temperature. Field experiments were carried out in a mixed mode solar dryer located in the North of Portugal, with pre-blanched grapes. A good prediction of experimental solar drying curves was attained. The {{mathematical model}} can be applied for simulating solar drying of different foods, once known their specific thermo-physical properties. Simulations obtained with the developed model can be valuable for predicting accurate drying times and consequently to design, control and optimise the production of dried foods...|$|E
40|$|Solar drying {{of foods}} {{is an old}} technique, still used nowadays. Nevertheless, the {{mathematical}} approach of the complex phenomena involved is not completely integrated. Drawbacks appear in modelling heat transport, specially related to the huge variability of meteorological factors. The great dependence of the heat and mass transfer model parameters on water content is also frequently forgotten. Macroscopic changes (e. g. shrinkage) that occur during drying processes, are usually not considered in mass transfer equations, also affecting the predictive ability of the models. The objective of this work was to develop the mathematical basis and considerations for integrating heat and mass transfer phenomena, taking into consideration macroscopic changes and their correlation to changes at microscopic level (e. g. cellular shrinkage), that might occur during solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: With {{regard to}} the hazards of nitrite, {{application}} of natural preservatives {{in order to reduce}} the microbial load of meat and meat products is increasing. Owing to their anti-bacterial properties, red barberry and the <b>dried</b> residue <b>of</b> red <b>grape</b> could be suitable replacers for nitrite. Materials and Methods: Agar dilution method was employed in order to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the barberry extract and the <b>dried</b> residue <b>of</b> red <b>grape.</b> The anti-microbial effects of the barberry extract (0 - 600 mg/kg), the <b>dried</b> residue <b>of</b> red <b>grape</b> (0 - 2 %) and nitrite (30 - 90 mg/kg) were investigated on the total viable counts of Clostridium perfringens, as well as on the psychrophilic bacteria after 30 days of storage at 4 °C. Finally, the effects of the three independent variables in the optimal sample were examined on the growth of the inoculated C. perfringens. Results: The MIC of the barberry extract and the <b>dried</b> residue <b>of</b> red <b>grape</b> on Staphylococcus aureus was 3 and 6 (mg/ml), respectively. In the case of Escherichia coli, it was 4 and 7 (mg/ml), respectively. The barberry extract and nitrite reduced the growth of the living aerobic bacteria significantly. The spores of the inoculated C. perfringens had no growth in the optimum sample during storage. Conclusions: The barberry extract and the <b>dried</b> residue <b>of</b> red <b>grape</b> as natural preservatives, could partially substitute for nitrite {{in order to reduce the}} microbial load of sausage...|$|R
40|$|The <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> is a {{more complex}} process {{compared}} to the dehydration of other agricultural materials due to {{the necessity of a}} pretreatment operation prior to drying. Grape drying to produce raisins is a very slow process, due to the peculiar structure of grape peel, that is covered by a waxy layer. Its removal has been so far carried out by using several chemical pre-treatments. However, they cause heterogeneity in the waxes removal and create microscopic cracks. In this paper an abrasive pretreatment for enhancing the drying rate and preserving the grape samples is proposed. Two cultivars of grape were investigated: Regina white grape and Red Globe red grape. The drying kinetics of untreated and treated samples were studied using a convective oven at 50 ˚C. Fruit quality parameters such as sugar and organic acid contents, shrinkage, texture, peel damage (i. e. by SEM analysis) and rehydration capacity were studied {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} abrasive pretreatment on raisins. Abrasive pretreatment contributed to reduce drying time and rehydration time. The treated and untreated dried grapes were significantly different (p < 0. 05) in sugar and in tartaric acid content. On the contrary, no significant differences (p < 0. 05) in malic and citric acids and in texture properties between untreated and treated samples were observe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Pishin and Killa Abdullah districts, which are known as the main grapes {{producing}} area of Balochistan. Raisins are simply dried grapes produced from grapes mostly produced in Pishin and Killa Abdullah districts of northern upland Balochistan. Ripened grapes are either marketed in the fresh form to different markets or transformed to raisins to increase its shelf life. Two types of grapes drying common in the area; when the drying process is done in the sun shine after pre-drying treatment the end product is locally called as Monaka, while when drying process is done in a shady and well ventilated room without any treatment the end product is locally called as Kishmish, they both are collectively called as raisins. The study results revealed that 3000 kg of fresh Haita grapes are required to produce 1000 kg of Monaka with grape raisins ratio of 3 : 1. Similarly for making 1000 kg Kishmish, 3500 kg of fresh Kashmishi or Shundokhani grapes are required with a ratio of 3. 5 : 1. Overall average yields of Monaka and Kashmish produced from one acre grapes were, 1528 and 1148 kg, respectively in the study area. The producer net profit margin for producing 1000 kg of raisins (Monaka and Kashmish) was Rs. 60, 786 and Rs. 52, 663, respectively.

40|$|The {{effects of}} several enological {{practices}} on ochratoxin A (OTA) concentration in wines were evaluated. Analysis of OTA {{was performed by}} reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after immunoaffinity cleanup. Higher toxin levels were found in red wines (0. 017 to 0. 050 mu g/L) than white wines (0. 006 to 0. 022 mu g/L). Intensive pressing of pomace, prolonged <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> and storage in partially empty tanks increased OTA contamination of wines. Poor winery sanitation practice was {{the primary source of}} OTA contamination, as wines from contaminated wineries had the highest OTA values (0. 130 to 1. 300 mu g/L). Filtration through a 10 -pm membrane and heating on hot plates at 55 degrees C did not cause a significant decrease in the toxin level. An 80 % decrease of OTA was observed after wine filtration through a 0. 45 -mu m membrane (p < 0. 05). Eleven enological fining agents were tested to study their ability to remove OTA from wine. Enological decolorizing carbon removed (at 30 g/hL) up to 72 % of OTA. The Freundlich isotherm was used to model OTA adsorption on carbon. Results showed that carbon had selective adsorption (K-F = 3. 172 (mg/g) /(mg/L) (0. 8474)), but it did not affect polyphenol content and color of red wine. Nevertheless, a decrease of key sensory odorants of wine, such as 3 -methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and geraniol, was observed...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} convective <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> food materials was developed. These materials shrink considerably, as moisture content decreases; for this reason, the proposed model takes shrinkage into account as a fundamental part <b>of</b> the <b>drying</b> operation.

The resulting system of three non-linear partial differential equations is solved numerically and the predicted values of moisture content and temperature are compared with experimental data for the <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> Sultana <b>grapes.</b> The effective moisture diffusivity in the mass <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> was described by an Arrhenius-type equation.

Drying was carried out under sun and also at 45, 55 and 65 °C in heat pump dryer. The initial moisture content of 456. 54 per (db) {{has been reduced to}} a final moisture content of 18 per cent (db). The time taken for drying varies with respect to different treatment and drying temperature. Drying at 45, 55 and 65 °C took 32, 27 and 21 hours for Ethyl oleate plus K 2 CO 3   pretreatment. The highest drying rate observed in heat pump dryer was 1. 549 kg/kg min. at 65 °C. The initial drying rate was found to be higher in case of heat pump dryer. The energy requirement for <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> in heat pump dryer was found to be 35 per cent less than that of cabinet dryer. The efficiency of the evaporator and condenser coils was found to be 68 and 60 per cent respectively. Moisture extraction rate (MER) and Specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) values were higher and increased with temperature because of the decreased drying time. The coefficient of performance of the heat pump dryer at 45, 55 and 65 oC were 1. 89, 4. 31 and 6. 58 respectively.

40|$|<b>Drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> and {{subsequent}} wine-making are processes that characterize some premium quality Italian wines including in particular Amarone, a “Passito” {{dry red wine}} produced by a traditional, slow drying grape process. During this process, depending on the occurrence of favourable seasonal conditions for a noble rot infection, {{a positive impact on}} volatile compounds can develop[1 - 2]. In recent years a more modern drying approach has been suggested, with the aim of faster and more strictly controlled drying of grape. The drying conditions are expected to lead to different wine composition and the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the differences in wine volatile compounds produced from a) traditional and b) modern processes applying 2 different analytical approaches, SPME followed by GCxGC TOF MS and a classical approach with SPE followed by GC MS [3]. The wines produced from two different grapevine cultivars, Sangiovese and Corvina, with two different grape drying systems (slow vs. accelerated) were analyzed. The profiles of volatile compounds in wines were, as expected, quite different and the sample were clearly separated by PCA. The compounds that characterize the wines obtained by traditional drying system were well distinguishable and some of them were produced by Botrytis cinerea such as 1 -octen- 3 -ol, p- cymene, 4 -terpineol, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldeide. The concentrations of fatty acids and ethyl esters were higher in the wine produced by faster drying system as already reported in the literature [2], as well as the 3 - hydroxy ethyl butyrate, phenyl ethyl acetate and linalool. The preliminary results of this survey calls for further metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of grapes, in order to better understand how the variability of the grape metabolism induced by different drying conditions can influence the aroma of Amarone wine...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Grape juice {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} anthocyanins, with {{great potential for}} substituting synthetic food dyes. Carrier agents used in spray drying entraps anthocyanins, allowing their preservation. This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> juice and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on grape juice powder properties were evaluated. The grape juice powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but reconstituted juices presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> juice, resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored grape juice. Spray drying is applied for producing powdered grape juice with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy proteins blended with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality. Moreover, the use of carrier agents in spray drying promotes the microencapsulation of bioactive compounds, allowing their protection and preservation during processing and storage. The grape juice powder from cv. BRS Violeta can be applied in the food industry as a potential substitute for synthetic food dyes, {{in addition to being a}} promising additive for incorporating anthocyanins into functional foods. 201...|$|R

In order to determine the effect of leaf removal and cluster thinning on yield and quality of the clonal selection Riesling × Silvaner wine grape, it was used a completely randomized bifactorial design of 2 x 3. The first factor was removal of leaves (without defoliation and 60 % defoliation) and the second one was cluster thinning (maintaining 66 % or 33 % of clusters per plant). Plants with 66 % clusters and without leaf removal exhibited the highest total soluble solids content and yield <b>of</b> <b>grapes,</b> in fresh mass of clusters and fresh and <b>dry</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>grapes.</b> Plants without cluster thinning, but with removal of leaves, produced the lowest pH levels and total titratable acidity in the grapes.

The biomass heater was ignited when there is a fall in sunshine (after 5 PM) {{in order to maintain the}} temperature inside the dryer and the fuel used is the remains of the coconuts such as coconut fronts, coconut husk, coconut shell and firewood. The solar tunnel dryer coupled with the biomass heater dried the grapes which has an initial moisture content of 80 % (w. b.) to a final moisture content of 10 % (w. b.) over a time period of 30 hours whereas the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer without the biomass heater took 55 hours for reducing the moisture content <b>of</b> the <b>grapes</b> to the same level. The reduced drying time in the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer coupled with the biomass heater than that of the dryer without the biomass heater is due to the effect of biomass heater that is responsible for the constant increase in temperature inside the dryer which is made possible by supplying sufficient heat during the night time (after 5 PM) where there would be a drop in sunshine. Also, the quality <b>of</b> the <b>grapes</b> obtained from the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer coupled with biomass heater was found to be superior to that <b>of</b> the <b>grapes</b> obtained from the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer without the biomass heater which is due to the high temperature and low relative humidity prevailed all the time inside the dryer irrespective of fall in sunshine.

50|$|Throughout history, the {{vineyard}} and the Steinwein produced {{here have been}} noted in various texts and literary work. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in particular, described the wine {{as one of his}} favorites and wrote many lines praising its quality. In the 1840s {{the vineyard}} was visited by French wine writer André Jullien who described the sweet Steinwein from Würzburger Stein as being very potent and liable to cause violent headaches if too much was consumed. Jullien went on to describe that the strength and sweetness of the wines from Würzburger weren't necessarily the result of late harvest picking but rather from the post-harvest practice <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> the <b>grapes</b> out on mats prior to fermentation—making them essentially vins de paille or straw wines.|$|R
40|$|In the oenological sector, the {{withering}} {{process is}} of particular importance in the production <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> and sweet dessert wines due to the total or partial use of overripe and/or dehydrated grapes. This complex process leads to several changes in the chemical-physical characteristics <b>of</b> white <b>grape</b> berries affecting the wine quality and, {{at the end of}} the dehydration period, different visual attributes are usually present in the berry skins. The aim of this work, therefore, was to study the properties <b>of</b> Erbaluce <b>dried</b> <b>grapes</b> <b>of</b> varying external colors, classified into three groups based on reflectance colorimetry (green, gold and blue). The chemical composition, volatile profile and mechanical attributes were investigated, focusing on establishing relationships between CIEL *. a *. b * parameters <b>of</b> dehydrated <b>grapes</b> and their chemical-physical characteristics. The higher values of the glucose-fructose ratio, together with the higher content of sugars, gluconic acid and glycerol, but lower titratable acidity, suggests the presence of. Botrytis cinerea Pers. infection in blue withered berries, which has been microbiologically confirmed. Regarding the instrumental mechanical properties, blue dehydrated grapes were characterized by a lower skin hardness and higher skin thickness in agreement with the higher weight loss experienced. Finally, the determination of free and bound volatile compounds showed that some of them were only found in blue withered berries, δ-lactones being considered the main chemical markers of the noble rot infection that are important for the odor character. C- 10 alkyl massoia lactone was the most abundant volatile compound in blue botrytized grapes...|$|R
