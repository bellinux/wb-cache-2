50|$|<b>Epostane</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (developmental {{code name}} WIN-32729) is an {{inhibitor}} of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) {{that was developed}} as an contraceptive, abortifacient, and oxytocic drug but was never marketed. By inhibiting 3β-HSD, <b>epostane</b> blocks the biosynthesis of progesterone from pregnenolone (and also the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to androstenedione), thereby functioning as an antiprogestogen and terminating pregnancy. The drug was trialed and in a study {{was found to be}} slightly more effective at inducing abortion relative to mifepristone.|$|E
5000|$|... 3β-HSD is {{potently}} inhibited by azastene, cyanoketone, <b>epostane,</b> and trilostane. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and medrogestone {{are weak}} inhibitors of 3β-HSD which may substantially inhibit it at high dosages.|$|E
5000|$|... 3β-Hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} (3β-HSD) inhibitors such as amphenone B, azastene, cyanoketone, <b>epostane,</b> mitotane, and trilostane {{inhibit the}} conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids into Δ4-3-ketosteroids and thereby inhibit the production {{of most of the}} steroid hormones. Due to inhibition of progesterone biosynthesis, they have been investigated as contraceptives and abortifacients (though ultimately have never been marketed for this indication), and trilostane was formerly used to inhibit corticosteroid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.|$|E
40|$|So far, {{the use of}} <b>epostane,</b> a {{relatively}} new inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5 -delta 4 isomerase enzyme system (3 beta-HSD), has been confined to short-term interference with luteal and placental function. This study explored whether <b>epostane</b> treatment {{from the beginning of}} the cycle for approximately 1 month would also inhibit ovarian follicular function. Twenty females with regular cycles received <b>epostane</b> 150 mg/day (ten healthy volunteers) or 600 mg/day (ten patients with endometriosis). Blood samples were drawn three times per week during control and treatment cycles. At 150 mg/day the mean total area under the serum concentration curve (AUC) of estradiol (E 2) was somewhat higher than during the control cycles, despite apparently lower preovulatory E 2 surges. During medication the highest value of E 2 was found during the luteal phase. The mean AUC of progesterone (P) and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP) during the luteal surge was decreased by approximately 45 % each. At 600 mg/day all evaluable patients had lower AUC of E 2 than during the control cycle. The mean decrease in AUC of P and 17 -OHP was much more pronounced than in the lower dose group. Six of the ten patients showed no hormonal signs of follicular development and, consequently, anovulation. The capacity of <b>epostane</b> to modulate or inhibit, depending on the dose, ovarian follicular steroidogenesis and ovulation may prove valuable in a variety of clinical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Kallikrein and p(asminogen {{activator}} (PA) are serine proteases {{that have}} been implicated in the ovulatory process. <b>Epostane</b> and indomethacin are anti-ovulatory agents that inhibit steroid and eicosanoid synthesis, respectively. This study examines {{the effects of these}} two anti-ovulatory agents on ovarian kallikrein and PA activities during ovulation. The proteases were assayed by their actions on chromogenic peptide substrates S- 2266 and S- 2251, respectively. The ovulatory process was induced in 25 -day-old Wistar rats by giving them hCG (10 IU, s. c.) 2 days after the animals had been primed with eCG (10 IU, s. c.). Control animals ovulated approximately 60 - 70 ova/rat, with the first ova appearing in the oviducts at 10 - 12 h after hCG administration, and this was the same time ovarian kallikrein and PA activities reached a peak. When doses of <b>epostane</b> ranging from 0. 1 - 5. 0 mg/rat or doses of indomethacin ranging from 0. 03 to 3. 16 mg/rat were administered s. c. at 3 h after hCG, the two drugs inhibited ovulation and ovarian kallikrein and PA activities in a dose-dependent manner. However, the anti-ovulatory action of the two drugs was more closely correlated with suppression of kallikrein activity than with PA activity. Treatment of the animals with exogenous progesterone reversed the inhibitory action of <b>epostane,</b> but not of indomethacin. The results suggest that the increase in ovarian progesterone at the time of ovulation may influence ovarian kallikrein and PA activities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that prostaglandin (PG) F 2 α increases expression of genes related to recruitment of leukocytes in mature but not early corpus luteum (CL) and that insensitivity to PGF 2 α action in early CL {{is dependent on}} high intraluteal progesterone (P 4) concentrations. Experiment 1 examined early (0. 5 h) and late (10 h) in vivo effects of PGF 2 α on mature (d 17 of pseudopregnancy) and early (d 9) porcine CL. Real-time PCR {{was used to measure}} mRNA for chemokines (IL 8, CXCL 2, CCL 2, CCL 8, CCL 4, CCL 11) and chemokine receptors (CCR 1, CCR 2, CXCR 2, CCR 5). Western blotting was used to measure protein expression and phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB proteins. Treatment with PGF 2 α for 10 h increased mRNA for almost all of these genes (all expect CXCL 2 and CCL 11) in d 17 CL but not d 9 CL. Treatment with PGF 2 α also led to greater phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB- 1 A protein in d 17 than d 9 CL. Experiment 2 had a 2 × 2 factorial design with d 9 gilts treated or not treated with <b>epostane</b> (3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor to suppress intraluteal P 4) and treated or not treated with PGF 2 α. Treatment with PGF 2 α (10 h) or <b>epostane</b> alone did not induce expression of any of these genes in d 9 CL. However, PGF 2 α + <b>epostane</b> increased expression of all of these genes except CCL 11. In conclusion, PGF 2 α increases mRNA for chemokines and chemokine receptors in mature CL with similar PGF 2 α effects induced in early CL if intraluteal P 4 is suppressed prior to PGF 2 α treatment...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF) causes luteolysis of the pig {{corpus luteum}} (CL) only after Day 12 of the estrous cycle.

Multiple PGF-induced responses were evaluated, including genes involved in production of PGF and estradiol- 17 beta, apoptosis (caspase 3), and transcription (FOSB). These responses are associated with PGF-induced luteolysis and do not normally occur in CL lacking luteolytic capacity.

40|$|In this differential-display {{polymerase}} chain reaction-based study, {{four different}} primer sets generated cDNA fragments of ovarian carbonyl reductase genes that were uniquely expressed during the ovulatory process in eCG-primed immature rats. The temporal pattern of expression of this aldo-keto reductase gene was delineated by extracting ovarian RNA at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after induction of ovulation via injection of the primed animals with hCG. The {{results showed that}} at least four homol-ogous forms of this gene were transcribed during ovulation. Northern blot analyses indicated a 14 -fold increase in ovarian mRNA for carbonyl reductase, with expression reaching a peak at 8 h after hCG treatment and then declining to negligible lev-els during the next 16 h. In situ hybridization revealed {{that most of the}} transcription was in the thecal connective tissue of the ovary and was absent from the granulosa layer of ovarian folli-cles. Treatment of the animals with ovulation-blocking doses of <b>epostane</b> (an inhibitor of progesterone synthesis) or indometh-acin (an inhibitor of prostanoid synthesis) did not reduce the expression of ovarian carbonyl reductase. Nevertheless, the tem-poral pattern of expression of carbonyl reductase after the in-duction of ovulation suggests that this enzyme activity is at least indirectly associated with the ovulatory process...|$|E
40|$|Separate genes encode {{the human}} type 1 (placenta, breast tumors, other {{peripheral}} tissues) and type 2 (gonad, adrenal) isoforms of 3 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 -HSD 1, 3 -HSD 2). Mutagenesis of 3 -HSD 1 produced the Y 154 F, H 156 Y and K 158 Q mutant enzymes in the probable Y 154 -P-H 156 -S-K 158 catalytic motif. The H 156 Y mutant of the 3 -HSD 1 created a chimera of the 3 -HSD 2 motif (Y 154 -P-Y 156 -S-K 158) in 3 -HSD 1. The D 241 N, D 257 L, D 258 L and D 265 N mutants {{are in the}} potential isomerase site of the 3 -HSD 1 enzyme. Homology modeling with UDP-galactose- 4 -epimerase predicted that Asp 36 in the Rossmann-fold domain {{is responsible for the}} NAD(H) specificity of human 3 -HSD 1, and our D 36 A/K 37 R mutant tested that assignment. The H 156 Y mutant of the 3 -HSD 1 enzyme shifted the substrate (DHEA) kinetics to the 14 -fold higher Km value measured for the 3 -HSD 2 activity. From Dixon analysis, <b>epostane</b> inhibited the 3 -HSD 1 activity with 17 -fold greater affinity compared to 3 -HSD 2 and H 156 Y. The mutants of Tyr 154 and Lys 158 exhibited no dehydrogenase activity and appear to be catalytic 3 -HSD residues. The D 257 L and D 258 L mutations eliminated isomerase activity, suggesting that Asp 257 or Asp 258 may be catalytic residues for isomerase activity. The D 36 A/K 37 R mutant shifted the cofactor preference of both 3 -HSD and isomerase from NAD(H) to NADP(H). In addition to characterizing catalytic residues, these studies have identified the structural basis (His 156) for an exploitable difference in the substrate and inhibition kinetics of 3 -HSD 1 and 3 -HSD 2. Hence, {{it may be possible to}} selectively inhibit human 3 -HSD 1 to slow the growth of hormone-sensitive breast tumor cells and control placental steroidogenesi...|$|E

Animals on Day 7 after estrus were divided into four groups: 1) control (C), 2) PGF, 3) EPO, and 4) PGF plus EPO (PGF+EPO). Treatment with EPO (10 mg/kg) or vehicle was given every 12 h for 36 h. Treatment with PGF (25 mg) or vehicle was given at 38 h, and CL were collected from all animals at 48 h. Some CL from each animal were frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA and protein analysis. Remaining CL were incubated in media for 2 h for determination of P 4 and PGF production. EPO dramatically decreased production of P 4 by luteal tissue (ng/mg tissue) by 90 % and 95 % in EPO and PGF+EPO groups, respectively, compared to C (P < 0. 01). Low production of PGF by luteal tissue was found in C, PGF, and EPO groups; however, treatment with PGF+EPO dramatically increased (782 %) luteal PGF production. Similar to intraluteal PGF production, increased mRNA for cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS 2) and phospholipase A 2 (group IB; PLA 2 G 1 B) {{was found in the}} PGF+EPO, but not in the EPO or PGF, group. Aromatase (CYP 19 A 1) mRNA was not induced by PGF or EPO; however, PGF+EPO caused a more than 40 -fold increase in CYP 19 A 1 mRNA (P < 0. 01). CASP 3 mRNA was increased (P < 0. 01) by EPO (3. 4 -fold) and by PGF (2. 7 -fold) but was most dramatically increased by PGF+EPO (5. 3 -fold), whereas caspase activity was only increased by PGF (1. 5 -fold) or PGF+EPO (2. 2 -fold). Thus, these data support the hypothesis that elimination of the protective effect of intraluteal P 4 does not directly cause luteolysis of the early CL but allows PGF to induce luteolytic responses in CL lacking luteolytic capacity...|$|E
40|$|Preterm birth (< 37 weeks {{completed}} {{weeks of}} gestation) affects 9 - 12 % of all live births; {{with the majority}} being moderately preterm birth (32 - 36 weeks gestation). It {{is the leading cause}} of neonatal mortality and morbidity and males have been reported to be at greater risk than females. In this thesis, I have examined the effect of moderate preterm birth, using an ovine model, on the structure of the heart and cardiomyocyte growth, and on the structure and composition of the large conduit arteries (thoracic aorta and left carotid artery). Pregnant ewes were induced to deliver vaginally using <b>epostane</b> (50 mg in 2 ml ethanol) at 0. 9 of term (132 ± 1 days of gestation) or at term (147 ± 1 days of gestation). Clinically relevant doses of Betamethasone (11. 4 mg) were also administered 24 hours and 48 hours before birth to ewes delivering preterm. Offspring were euthanised 2 days after birth or at 14. 5 months of age. During the study period, preterm sheep were significantly lighter and smaller compared to term controls, with survival rates 75 % for both preterm male and preterm female lambs after the first 2 weeks of life. At 12 months of age, body composition was not different between preterm and term sheep. By 14 months of age, preterm female sheep had caught up in body weight to terms; however preterm males were still lighter than term males. At this time, no detectable differences in arterial pressure and heart rate were observed between preterm and term sheep. In the immediate period after birth, preterm hearts were lighter and smaller compared to terms; however, relative to body weight, only right ventricular (RV) chamber volume remained smaller and left ventricle (LV) and RV walls were thicker. Total number of cardiomyocytes within the LV plus septum (LV+S) was not significantly different between preterm and term lambs; however relative to body weight, preterm lambs exhibited significantly more cardiomyocytes. Preterm lambs also had a significantly higher proportion of mononucleated cardiomyocytes in the LV+S but significantly lower proportion of binucleated cardiomyocytes compared to term lambs; indicative of an immature heart. In adulthood, preterm sheep had smaller RV and LV wall volumes, but when adjusted to body weight, there were no longer any differences. Interestingly, there was sexual dimorphism in the long-term effects on the LV+S; preterm male sheep exhibited significantly reduced wall volume, wall thickness and cardiomyocyte number compared to term male sheep, whereas no differences were observed between preterm and term females. In the immediate period after birth, there was no evidence of arterial injury in the thoracic aorta or left carotid artery. At this time, preterm lambs had narrower lumen areas in both blood vessels and thinner walls were observed in the left carotid artery. When adjusted for body weight, lumen area and wall thickness actually increased in the aorta of preterm lambs compared to term controls. Collagen deposition within the aortic wall was significantly reduced in preterm male lambs compared to terms. In adulthood, the number of elastin layers and elastin content was significantly reduced, whereas smooth muscle content increased in the left carotid artery of preterm sheep compared to term sheep. Interestingly, there was sexual dimorphism observed in the effects of preterm birth on aortic structure, such that preterm male sheep exhibited significant reductions in lumen size, medial area, intima-media thickness and layers of elastin compared to term male sheep, however no differences were observed in females. In my studies, moderate preterm birth after antenatal corticosteroid exposure has resulted in significant alterations in cardiovascular structure, predominantly in males. Even though, these differences are likely attributed to the smaller body size of the preterm male sheep, the reduced complement of cardiomyocytes in the LV+S and thinner walls with fewer layers of elastin in the aorta are likely to render the adult preterm male cardiovascular system particularly vulnerable to secondary postnatal insults and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular consequences in later life. In conclusion, this thesis provides valuable insight into the effects of moderate preterm birth on the cardiovascular system in the immediate period after birth and in early adulthood. Overall, this study is clinically important given the large proportion of individuals born moderately preterm. The findings highlight the cardiovascular vulnerability of those born moderately preterm, particularly in males, and these adverse effects are expected to be greater with increasing severity of prematurity...|$|E
