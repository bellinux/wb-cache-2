40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{environmental policy}} in a decentralized economic federation comprising two countries, where {{a federal government}} decides upon environmental targets (maximum allowable emissions) for each country, which are implemented by the national governments. Both national governments have commitment power vis-à-vis the federal government, whereas one of the national governments (the horizontal Stackelberg leader) also has commitment power vis-à-vis the other country (the horizontal follower). The results show how the horizontal and vertical commitment power affect the horizontal leader’s use of income and production taxes, which are the tax instruments available at the national level.

40|$|We study {{a setting}} where the opportunism or {{commitment}} problem identified by Hart and Tirole (1990) may arise. An upstream monopolist may sell its product to two differentiated downstream retailers. Contract unobservability induces the manufacturer and each retailer to free-ride on margins earned by rival retailers, {{resulting in low}} transfer prices and low overall profit. O’Brien and Shaffer (1992) proposed {{a solution to this}} problem involving squeezing retail margins by using maximum RPM and high transfer prices. We show that when retail demand depends in any degree on retail sales effort, this equilibrium breaks down, and the opportunism problem reappears with full force. We show that no type of own-sale contracts or combination of own-sale restraints will solve the problem if sales effort matters. Moreover we show that certain <b>horizontal</b> <b>commitments,</b> as for example industry-wide minimum RPM, may restore the fully integrated outcome, but only in special cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} current WTO rules concerning telecommunications services. It {{includes an}} explanation {{of the structure of the}} GATS, its Annex on Telecommunications, and the Agreement on Basic Telecommunication Services. As discussed in the previous chapter, the latter reflects the commitments of sixty-nine countries that agreed to open their markets to foreign basic telecommunication services and to foreign suppliers of these services. It also contains additional rules which are linked to these commitments and are assembled under the so-called ‘Reference Paper’. The GATT is relevant in relation to equipment and terminals used to convey and receive telecommunications signals. This, however, constitutes a different line of trade, which is discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. he GATS, similarly to the GATT, aims at protecting equality of competitive opportunities for companies in domestic markets regardless of their origin and the origin of their services. It aims at facilitating progressive liberalisation of services while enabling WTO Members to regulate them “in order to meet national policy objectives”. The GATS thus constitutes the framework agreement relevant to all services and particularly those that, like telecommunication services, have been or are being liberalised. n contrast with the GATT, the GATS contains a mix of <b>horizontal</b> <b>commitments</b> applicable to all services and service suppliers and sectorbased commitments only applicable to those sectors which have been explicitly open to trade by WTO Members. Horizontal rules apply to all measures by Members affecting trade in services. There are no limits in the scope of services except those supplied on a non-commercial basis or outside any form of competition, such as national security or justice.

40|$|Although {{services}} are not precisely defined and the relevant economic data are rather poor, the WTO Secretariat estimates that {{international trade in}} services now constitutes some one-third of total international trade. Barriers to these international flows involve a host of national regulations, licensing requirements, approval procedures, ownership conditions, etc. With {{the signing of the}} Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO in 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) established a multilateral framework under which Members make <b>horizontal</b> and sector-specific <b>commitments</b> to free up these barriers. Using a somewhat different approach, the NAFTA also set up a system of commitments for liberalizing services trade amongst the three North American members. Whilst generally recognised as a modest beginning, GATS 2000 in Geneva is now addressing a whole host of general rules and sector-specific issues to further liberalize these streams of international trade. Only relatively recently has analytical work begun addressing the environmental impacts of services at the national level. Services and services delivery have many characteristics which distinguish them from extractive and manufacturing industries. Such differences mean that ne...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} employee’s {{commitment}} is capturing {{the attention of}} managers and researchers. Besides {{being one of the}} most effective alternatives for achieving the organizational goals, the importance of organizational commitment (OC) lies in its ability to influence the efficiency and the wellbeing of members of an organization. The article examines the relationships between personal values and components of OC. Participants were selected from twelve Argentinean organizations. Subjects completed a questionnaire of personal data, and two scales to measure individualism- collectivism (vertical and <b>horizontal),</b> and organizational <b>commitment,</b> respectively. All subjects were classified into eight subgroups, after dichotomizing by median each dimensions of values (HI: horizontal individualism; VI: vertical individualism; HC: horizontal collectivism, and HV: vertical collectivism). The four most representative subgroups (N= 162) were selected, that is, who exhibited high scores in one of the four dimensions and lows in the remaining three. In such subgroups were calculated analysis of variance, post-hoc comparison tests, and correlation analysis. The more significant findings can be summarized in the following items: a) collectivists (HC or VC) show a higher level of affective commitment, while individualists relate to their companies through normative or continuance commitment; b) women and senior employees exhibit greater levels of affective and normative commitment; c) managers, employees with higher academic degree, and employees of large companies, feel attached to their organizations through normative commitment; d) continuance commitment seems to work differently than affective and normative commitment because it has no associations with any of the socio-demographic variables studied. Strengths and limitations of the study are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.   </div...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 12 December 2016 Examining Board: Professor Petros C. Mavroidis, European University Institute; Professor Bernard M. Hoekman, European University Institut; Judge Allan Rosas, Court of Justice of the European Union; Professor Robert Wolfe, Queen's University, CanadaThe thesis {{focuses on}} the {{liberalization}} of services {{in the context of}} preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The first part develops an interpretation of Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that regulates the conclusion of the so-called economic integration agreements (EIAs). It is argued that in the context of preferentialism, the GATS does not impose any market access discipline but aims at creating a non-discriminatory trading environment. Special attention is paid to Mode 4 and to the type of liberalization that it covers. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the main elements of Article V GATS (sectoral/modal coverage and non-discrimination) are employed to conduct an empirical analysis of EIAs. The chosen sample includes four of the European Unionﾒs international trade agreements that feature significant services liberalization. The services schedules of these four agreements are reviewed and rated to find out their level of liberalization. In the context of the EU, its services commitments continue, to a large extent, to be determined individually by its Member States. As the thesis shows, significant variations still exist among different Member States both in <b>horizontal</b> and sector-specific <b>commitments.</b> The thesis connects the EUﾒs internal situation to the wider issue of how deep EIAs should be in order to escape claims of non-compliance. It asks the question of how the exact coverage and level of non-discrimination should be assessed in a situation where commitments vary across different states or regions of the same contracting party. No clear answer can be provided but the thesis proposes that in order to be in line with its international obligations, the EU, as well as any WTO Member with internally divided regulatory powers in services, should ensure that when signing EIAs, the commitments of all Member States (or, in the case of other WTO Members, all states/regions/other entities with regulatory powers in services) reach the GATS threshold of substantiality in their level of liberalization...|$|R
