5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{crude oil}} was {{discovered}} in the Turner Valley field, below and {{to the west of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>cap.</b> This came as a shock to geologists because the free <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> which could have provided the reservoir drive to produce the oil, had largely been produced and flared off by that time. As a result, less than 12% of the original oil in place at Turner Valley will ever be recovered.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{trim and}} features make the VAM Javelin {{equivalent to the}} U.S. and Canadian AMC Javelin SST. Factory options included power drum brakes with manual transmission, power steering, heater, passenger's side remote mirror, remote controlled driver's side mirror, custom sport wheels and rear bumper guards. Dealer installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> license plate frames, mud flaps, AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy duty adjustable shocks, and many others.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} logos and emblems spread {{throughout}} its body. “GT-H” logos also {{featured on the}} grille, rear faux <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> and on the trunk lid. Further, Shelby replaced its front splitter and rear spoiler with elements made with carbon-fiber. The engine hood is also specially crafted with vents and a big bulge at the center, same as the Shelby GT. The exterior upgrades {{is a set of}} 19-inch aluminum wheels which are wrapped in high-performing Michelin rubber (255/40s at the front and 275/40s at the rear.|$|E
5000|$|In Highway Rider, {{the player}} {{controls}} a bike through a highway from obstacles such as cars, trucks and construction sites. If the player comes closer to obstacles, then it's called [...] "Close Call" [...] and it's how highscore is recorded. The player {{can also use}} collected [...] "Boosts" [...] which increases speed all at once. After every successful close call, <b>gas</b> <b>caps</b> are collected. This helps to buy characters, boosts and locations.|$|R
30|$|Some geopressured {{aquifers}} may initially {{contain some}} free gases, which exist when the gas saturation {{is below the}} critical gas saturation. Critical gas saturation is an important parameter in relative permeability data for production of mobile gas. It is generally assumed that critical gas saturation is about 2 – 5 % and depends on the porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock (Matthews 1981). This study focuses only on dissolved gas or initial immobile gas; it does not examine <b>gas</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R
30|$|The Dezful embayment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} areas in south of Iran and includes 45 oil fields, often associated with <b>gas</b> <b>caps.</b> Several of them are categorized as super giants as they contain 10 – 50 billions barrels of oil in place, i.e., Aghajari, Ahwaz, Bibihakimeh, Gachsaran, Mansuri, Marun, and Rag-e-Safid. This zone is characterized by intense structural depression and was formed as a result of the Late Cretaceous continental collision between the Eurasian (central Iran) and Persian plates (Bordenave and Hegre 2005).|$|R
25|$|The 1980 models {{gained a}} higher {{appointment}} of {{safety in the}} form of a locking <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> fold-down high-back individual seats with adjustable headrests, and the heater was made standard even on the most economical versions. New features included a split rear seat back, a 180km/h / 110mph speedometer, new seat patterns, a seven-blade flexible fan for the 258 six, new steering wheel designs for each trim level, and a new VAM grille design shared between the two versions. The X model included a new side decal design and blacked out hubcaps. The optional equipment list for the Gremlin X included a new AM FM stereo radio, electric antenna, and intermittent wipers.|$|E
25|$|Once Alberta's Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board began {{operating}} in 1938, the BA and Gas and Oil Products Limited plants {{had to change}} their operations significantly. Only Royalite had a market for its residue of gas stripped of liquids in the Canadian Western Natural Gas distribution system. The other two plants flared or burned off most of their residue gas until the board ruled that only wells connected to a market could be produced, stopping the practice. Since the rule applied only to wells that tapped the oil reservoir's overlying <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> the Hartell and Longview plants stayed in operation by processing solution gas, or gas dissolved in oil from the Valley's wells.|$|E
25|$|Factory options {{consisted}} of a heating system with windshield defroster, power drum brakes, power steering, bright molding package, protective side moldings, parcel shelf, courtesy lights (separate or in-shelf), luxury wheel covers, sports steering wheel, custom steering wheel, passenger's side remote mirror, remote-controlled driver's side remote mirror, bright panel between taillights, and metal bumper guards with rubber edges. Dealership options included a universal 6000 RPM VDO tachometer with dual hands, full vinyl roof with additional bright moldings, heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar and stiffer adjustable shock absorbers), floor-mounted shifter for the three-speed transmission, front disk brakes, locking <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> license plate frames, mud flaps, trunk cover luggage rack, universal air conditioning system, among others.|$|E

30|$|Flow {{behavior}} of gas at low saturation in Gulf Coast geopressured brine {{is a critical}} question. Free gas is released from brine inside the aquifer by decreasing pressure below the bubble point pressure caused by brine production. As gas bubbles continue to grow, they will eventually link up throughout the pore structure of the reservoir rock. The saturation at which this link-up occurs—critical gas saturation—depends on pore size distribution. If gas saturation builds up to a level higher than that at which a continuous gas phase is formed, gas will begin to flow. Critical gas saturation is always equal to or larger than initial gas saturation, except in <b>gas</b> <b>caps</b> (Holtz 2002; Martin 1979; Matthews 1981).|$|R
50|$|After his {{retirement}} from wrestling, {{he returned home}} to International Falls and opened a service station. A local legend claims that Nagurski had the best repeat business in town because he would screw customers' <b>gas</b> <b>caps</b> down so tight after filling their tanks {{that no one else}} in town could unscrew them. He retired from that in 1978, at the age of 70. He lived out a quiet life on the shores of Rainy Lake on the Canada-US border. He performed the coin toss at Super Bowl XVIII in Tampa, Florida, with Washington Redskins quarterback and co-captain Joe Theismann calling the toss on behalf of his team's co-captains and the captains of the opposing Los Angeles Raiders.|$|R
25|$|The Mustang Bullitt {{returned}} in February 2008, {{a variant of}} the Mustang GT, the last version of which was produced in 2001. It is reminiscent of the Dark Highland Green GT-390 fastback Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. Available in Dark Highland Green or Black exterior paint without spoiler and GT fender emblems; the faux <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> on the deck lid is replaced by a unique Bullitt version. The Mustang GT's standard fog light-equipped grille is replaced with a specially designed pony-less style grille highlighted by an aluminium accent. Dark Argent Gray 18-inch cast-aluminum euro-flange wheels are used with matching brake calipers and larger, 3.5inch exhaust tips replace the Mustang GT's standard 3 inch tips. Although side (quarter) window louvers (as shown in picture) are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E
25|$|It was {{suspected}} that the Model Z's crash during a speed run in December 1931 was due to an unexpected failure of the gasoline tank cap, which may have come loose and passed through the windshield. A bullet-proof windscreen and internal fuel caps {{were part of the}} new design. Analysis of motion picture film of the event examined frame-by-frame, is inconclusive. Control surface flutter is a more likely cause. It is theorized that the <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> struck the pilot and incapacitated him, causing a sudden upset in pitch that led to uncontrolled flutter in the right aileron which imparted undue stress on that wing, causing it to pitch up sharply and fail. In addition, tests of a reproduction aircraft have shown that the Gee Bee Z was susceptible to aerodynamic flutter at high speed. The 1932 R-1 and its sister ship, the R-2, were the successors of the previous year's Thompson Trophy-winning Model Z.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|E
5000|$|The Bemis Manufacturing Company is an American {{manufacturing}} {{company based in}} Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin and {{is best known for}} its toilet seat products. Bemis also manufactures plastic lawn, commercial, and indoor furniture, suction canisters, sharps containers, fluid management systems, <b>gas</b> <b>caps,</b> gauges and various contracted extrusion and injection molded plastic parts for companies such as John Deere and Whirlpool Corporation. The company is a pioneer of co-injection molding, a process in which virgin resin is injected with scrap plastic. Bemis' plastic work has won a number of awards in the SPI Structural Plastics Div. design competition, particularly with the John Deere 7000 tractor, which is believed to represent the first instance of coinjection molding [...] "to large parts where a recycled engineering material (ABS) is used in the core".|$|R

25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included flow-through ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking <b>gas</b> <b>cap,</b> among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|E
500|$|As ethanol FFVs became commercially {{available}} {{during the late}} 1990s, the common {{use of the term}} [...] "flexible-fuel vehicle" [...] became synonymous with ethanol FFVs.

500|$|On August 10, 1978 three {{teenage girls}} of the Urlich family of Osceola, Indiana {{were killed when}} the 1973 Pinto they were in was {{involved}} in a rear-end collision. [...] The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's <b>gas</b> <b>cap</b> which had been inadvertently left {{on the top of the}} car and subsequently fell onto the road. [...] While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van. [...] Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. Indiana v. Ford was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with murder. [...] If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute. [...] Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case. [...] The effort was led by James F. Neal with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the Elkhart County state's attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students. A former head of the NHTSA, testifying on Ford's behalf, said the Pinto's design was no more or less safe than that of any other car in its class. In 1980 Ford was found not guilty. In 1980 a civil suit was settled for $7500 to each plaintiff.|$|E
5000|$|NEMO {{has been}} used to explore {{generation}} options for the year 2030 under a variety of renewable energy (RE) and abated fossil fuel technology scenarios. A 2012 study investigates the feasibility of a fully renewable system using concentrated solar power (CSP) with thermal storage, windfarms, photovoltaics, existing hydroelectricity, and biofuelled gas turbines. A number of potential systems, which also meet NEM reliability criteria, are identified. The principal challenge is servicing peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days and periods of low wind. [...] A 2014 study investigates three scenarios using coal-fired thermal generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and gas-fired gas turbines with and without capture. These scenarios are compared to the 2012 analysis using fully renewable generation. The study finds that [...] "only under a few, and seemingly unlikely, combinations of costs can any of the fossil fuel scenarios compete economically with 100% renewable electricity in a carbon constrained world". A 2016 study evaluates the incremental costs of increasing renewable energy shares under a range of greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>caps</b> and carbon prices. The study finds that incremental costs increase linearly from zero to 80% RE and then escalate moderately. The study concludes that this cost escalation is not a sufficient reason to avoid renewables targets of 100%.|$|R
