Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had significantly lower risk. However they could not show a <b>direct</b> <b>causation.</b> The study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases (STDs) that may {{increase the risk of}} cancer instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent ejaculation between the ages of 20 and 40 may be correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, frequent ejaculation in one's 50s was found to be correlated with a lower such risk in this same study.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{children}} retreat from argument-structure overgeneralization errors (e. g., *Don’t giggle me) by inferring that frequently encountered verbs are unlikely to be grammatical in unattested constructions, and by making use of syntax-semantics correspondences (e. g., verbs denoting internally caused actions such as giggling cannot normally be used causatively). The present study tested a new account based on a unitary learning mechanism that combines both of these processes. Seventy-two participants (ages 5 – 6, 9 – 10, and adults) rated overgeneralization errors with higher (*The funny man’s joke giggled Bart) and lower (*The funny man giggled Bart) degrees of <b>direct</b> external <b>causation.</b> The errors with more-direct causation were rated as less unacceptable than those with less-direct causation. This finding is consistent with the new account, under which children acquire—in an incremental and probabilistic fashion—the meaning of particular constructions (e. g., transitive causative = <b>direct</b> external <b>causation)</b> and particular verbs, rejecting generalizations where the incompatibility between the two is too great...|$|R

40|$|The {{explanations}} for the escalation of drug-related violence that {{are found in the}} literature are diverse as well as numerous. Among these explanations two <b>direct</b> <b>causations</b> dominate: first, Mexican government policy and strategy, primarily since Calderon took office in 2006 and to lesser extent during the Fox administration and second, the competition between and within the Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) since 2000. However, when these explanations are compared to the empirical data, the escalation of violence primarily coincides with the policy of Calderon and there are no elevated levels of violence since 2000, which reduces the validity of inter and intra-cartel violence within the timeframe of the literature. 								 		 The empirical data suggests that since 2004 drug-related violence started rising slightly, with a clear break and an escalation of homicides since 2007. This also adds more weight to two more explanations: first the diversification of DTO modus operandi, a process that has essentially started {{with the arrival of the}} Zetas and second, with a decline in demand for Mexican drugs in America since 2006. 						 Furthermore, the findings from the literature study seem best explained by the principle of producer-product, as the direct causality between policy, competition and drug-related violence could hardly exist without the existing environment. Pre-conditions like weak institutional capacity, corruption, availability of weapons, poverty, geography, culture and others are seen as exacerbates and contributors to the escalating levels of drug-related violence...|$|R
40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (rsfMRI) of the mouse brain has revealed the presence of robust functional connectivity networks, including an antero-posterior system reminiscent of the human default network (DMN) and correlations between anterior insular and cingulate cortices recapitulating features of the human “salience network”. However, rsfMRI networks are typically identified using symmetric measurements of correlation that do not provide a description of directional information flow within individual network nodes. Recent progress has allowed the measure of directed maps of functional connectivity in the human brain, providing a novel interpretative dimension that could advance our understanding of the brains’ functional organization. Here, we used Granger Causality (GC), a measure of <b>directed</b> <b>causation,</b> to investigate the direction of information flow within mouse rsfMRI networks characterized by unidirectional (i. e. frontal-hippocampal) as well as reciprocal (e. g. DMN) underlying connectional architecture. We observed robust hippocampal-prefrontal dominant connectivity along the direction of projecting ventro-subicular neurons both at single subject and population level. Analysis of key DMN nodes revealed the presence of directed functional connectivity from temporal associative cortical regions to prefrontal and retrosplenial cortex, reminiscent of directional connectivity patterns described for the human DMN. We also found robust directional connectivity from insular to prefrontal areas. In a separate study, we reproduced the same directional connectivity fingerprints and showed that mice recapitulating a mutation associated to autism spectrum disorder exhibited reduced or altered directional connectivity. Collectively, our results document converging directional connectivity towards retrosplenial and prefrontal cortical areas consistent with higher integrative functions subserved by these regions, and provide a first description of directional topology in resting-state connectivity networks that complements ongoing research in the macroscale organization of the mouse brain. ...|$|R

Moreover, school attainment may proxy for some additional component of human capital that is relevant for earnings and employment—such as non-cognitive aspects of education that are not captured in the numeracy score. If any of these arguments hold true, the exclusion restriction that the instrument is related to wages and employment only through individuals’ numeracy skills and not in any other way would be violated.|$|R

Yet training modalities to achieve these competencies are not clearly defined, and outcome measurements are elusive. This article shows an effective method to meet these desired outcomes. Sixty-one freshmen (class of 2005) participated in forty hours of nondental community service, and reflective journals were completed by the end of second year. Competency outcomes were measured by selecting key words and phrases found in the individual journals. Key phrases were related to compassion, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Also, phrases had to be accompanied by written indications of <b>direct</b> program <b>causation.</b> The combination of active-learning (based upon service learning models) in public health settings outside of the dental realm, accompanied by reflective journaling, enhanced cultural understanding and community spirit in the majority of students...|$|R
40|$|SummaryChronic {{multifocal}} osteomyelitis (CMO) is {{an uncommon}} disease entity with descriptions possibly {{emanating from the}} medical literature over one century ago, and there are numerous disease entities which have been historically detailed and which are probably synonymous. The illness is one of chronicity with exacerbating and remitting focal bony lesions. The differential diagnosis for a bony lesion which ultimately proves to be CMO is initially quite broad. There is no absolute pathognomonic clinical finding, and the diagnosis is highly dependent on clinical course, histopathology, and an absence of microbial infection. Recent {{studies have focused on}} immune dysfunction or dysregulation, and there are now many other diseases which are inflammatory in nature and which have been diagnosed among patients with CMO. Despite the aforementioned, the potential for <b>direct</b> infectious <b>causation</b> or indirect causation by infectious stimulation of immunity cannot be entirely excluded.

5000|$|RMH {{indicates}} that Aad and Ab affect each other (<b>direct</b> two-way <b>causation).</b> It {{is based on}} a balance theory introduced by Heider (1946) in that people try to sustain the cognitive balance. Heider explained that [...] "a balanced configuration exists if attitudes toward the parts of a causal unit are similar. For example, if a consumer is exposed to an ad advocating a particular brand, the consumer will try to maintain a balanced view of the ad and the: a) liking both the ad and the brand or b) disliking both. The strengths of the RMH explain differences depending on situations and consumers. For instance, if a new product is introduced, there will be a relatively stronger flow will be from Aad to Ab. This is because a consumer may first be exposed to the brand through ad. However, if a consumer has loyalty to the brand, prior Ab may affect Aad.|$|R
30|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} popular to use {{networks}} to visualize and analyze the hierarchical structure within large datasets usually obtained from complex dynamical systems. Networks are especially useful for representing the extent and magnitude of interactions among the many components in complex systems.

These relations may be <b>directed</b> transitions, <b>causation,</b> or activations, or undirected when we examine similarities or co-occurrences. Examples of such usage {{can be found in}} finance [1], [2], biology [3], [4], sociology [5], and language [6]. Even without any further quantitative analysis of the network structure, showing such pair-wise relationships on a network often gives us a powerful overview of the structures that exist within the data. Beyond such crude ‘eyeballing’ of the network, there exist tools to (i) filter out the most essential structure in the network [7]–[9], (ii) identify important central nodes, (iii) quantify the hierarchical structure [10], [11], (iv) identify important patterns or paths in the network [4], and (v) identify clusters of nodes [12], [13].|$|R
40|$|The {{contrast}} between <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>causation</b> {{is the most}} widely discussed semantic distinction {{in the literature on}} causative constructions. This distinction has been claimed to correlate with a number of formal parameters, such as linguistic distance, productivity and length, which are linked to different functional and diachronic explanations based on the principles of iconicity and economy. The present study tests these claims on a typologically representative sample of languages from 46 diverse families, examining four formal variables and their association with (in) directness of causation. According to the data, formal length displays the most pervasive association with the semantic distinction in question, which supports the economy-based explanation. However, the relative prominence of the formal parameters also depends on the type of causatives and their stage of grammaticalization...|$|R

In this particular case, it means that these households' total family income was approximately twice that of the federal poverty line for their specific family size. As this data illustrates, the factors which contribute to hunger are interrelated and complex.|$|E

The analysis of a Spanish corpus allows us to examine previous accounts of case marking, namely the hypothesis of incorporation and the related ‘Stratal Uniqueness Law’, and the theory of <b>direct</b> vs. indirect <b>causation.</b> The second part is dedicated to the question whether the cognitive-semantic characteristics of the causation models have any effect on its syntax.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalization of team semantics {{which provides a}} framework for manipulationist theories of causation based on structural equation models, such as Woodward's and Pearl's; our causal teams incorporate (partial or total) information about functional dependencies that are invariant under interventions.

The evaluation of counterfactuals may involve the production of partially determined teams. We suggest a {{way of dealing with}} such cases by 1) the introduction of formal entries in causal teams, and 2) the introduction of weaker truth values (falsifiability and admissibility), for which we suggest some plausible semantical clauses. We introduce formal languages for both deterministic and probabilistic causal discourse, and study in some detail their inferential aspects. Finally, we apply our framework to the analysis of <b>direct</b> and total <b>causation,</b> and other notions of dependence and invariance...|$|R
