500|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{commander}} of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had {{a lot of confidence in}} him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could have him." [...] Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943.|$|E

[...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband.

[...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got this script.

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of a nazirite vow {{is part of}} the ambiguity of the Greek term [...] "Nazarene" [...] that appears in the New Testament; the sacrifice of a lamb and the offering of bread does suggest a relationship with Christian symbolism (then again, these are the two most frequent offerings prescribed in Leviticus, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn). While a saying in ( [...] and [...] ) attributed to Jesus makes it doubtful that he, reported to be [...] "a winebibber", was a nazirite during his ministry, the verse ends with the curious statement, [...] "But wisdom is justified of all her children". The advocation of the ritual consumption of wine as part of the Passover, the tevilah in Mark 14:22–25 indicated he kept this aspect of the nazirite vow when Jesus said, [...] "Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> drink it new in the kingdom of God." [...] The ritual with which Jesus commenced his ministry (recorded via Greek as [...] "Baptism") and his vow in [...] and [...] {{at the end of his}} ministry, do respectively reflect the final and initial steps (purification by immersion in water and abstaining from wine) inherent in a Nazirite vow. These passages may indicate that Jesus intended to identify himself as a Nazirite ("not drinking the fruit of vine") before his crucifixion.|$|E
