5|$|I {{had little}} hopes on Monday last {{but to have}} supped in your cabin: but it pleased God to order <b>it</b> <b>otherwise.</b> I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up, for by God they deserve it.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} breeds on exposed and usually {{uninhabited}} islands which it visits only at night. <b>It</b> <b>otherwise</b> frequents mid-depth waters {{away from the}} coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E

5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> made few changes to the film.|$|E
5|$|All group 3 {{elements}} have an odd atomic number, {{and therefore}} few stable isotopes. Scandium has one stable isotope, and yttrium itself {{has only one}} stable isotope, 89Y, is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide rare earths contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 {{is thought to be}} more abundant than <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> would be, {{due in part to the}} s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by electron emission (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with atomic mass numbers (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable atomic nuclei with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. 89Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.|$|E

5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> would have been.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Language Council (Språkrådet) is the {{official}} regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the Académie française does for French. However, many organizations and agencies {{require the use of}} the council's publication Svenska skrivregler in official contexts, with <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the glossary Svenska Akademiens ordlista (SAOL, currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary Svenska Akademiens Ordbok, in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language, their main purpose is to describe current usage.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 24, 1911. The film had mixed reviews from critics. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was thorough {{in the analysis of}} the film who did not like the production for its poor rehashed story and maudlin melodrama. The characters behavior was not logical and the series of events relied on deus ex machina elements, such as the Salvation Army suddenly decides to march down to the water's edge, then stop and remain in the background so that they can save his soul at the opportune moment. The reviewer did state that the acting was good. The Billboard review agreed that the story was implausible, but agreed that the skill of the actors made it more plausible than <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> would have been. The Morning Telegraph and Walton of The Moving Picture News would praise the film for its pathos and heart. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known to be held in any archive or by any collector.|$|E
50|$|The Pine smartwatch can be {{released}} from the wrist strap by pressing {{a button on the}} strap for a better audio signal during a phone call or to take photos with the 5MP rear-facing camera which <b>it's</b> <b>otherwise</b> blocked by the strap.|$|R

5|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected have certain protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session. Speeches, debates, and votes cast in the Diet also enjoy parliamentary privileges. Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing <b>it</b> <b>otherwise.</b> The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum. All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, {{and in the case of}} a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution therefor.|$|E

25|$|However, RDF {{puts the}} {{information}} in a formal way that a machine can understand. The purpose of RDF is to provide an encoding and interpretation mechanism so that resources {{can be described in}} a way that particular software can understand it; in other words, so that software can access and use information that <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> couldn't use.|$|E

25|$|The French {{title of}} this section has been {{retained}} in translation from the French Wikipedia page because the apparently corresponding term in English has {{not quite the same}} meaning. English-speaking historians, though they define <b>it</b> <b>otherwise,</b> in effect, regard the term 'contemporary history' as meaning 'within living memory'. French writers on the other hand, are inclined to open the period with the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|A fielder or fieldsman may {{field the}} ball with any part of his body. However, if while the ball is in play he {{wilfully}} fields <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> (e.g. by using his hat), the ball becomes dead and five penalty runs are awarded to the batting side, unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are in Law 28 of the Laws of cricket.|$|E
25|$|Although Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards enacted an {{exception}} to the general rules of Sabbath observance to permit driving to attend a synagogue, <b>it</b> <b>otherwise</b> formally requires the same rules of Shabbat observance as Orthodox Judaism with respect to carrying a burden. Therefore, Conservative Judaism's rabbinate requires the use of an eruv for ordinary carrying outside this exception. Compliance with the formal requirements varies. In general, conservative authorities and organizations have not attempted to build or develop rules for eruvin distinct from ones established by Orthodox authorities and organizations.|$|E
