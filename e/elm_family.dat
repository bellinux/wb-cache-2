50|$|Zelkova is a genus of six {{species of}} {{deciduous}} {{trees in the}} <b>elm</b> <b>family</b> Ulmaceae, native to southern Europe, and southwest and eastern Asia. They vary in size from shrubs (Z. sicula) to large trees up to 35 m tall (Z. carpinifolia). The leaves are alternate, with serrated margins, and (unlike the related elms) a symmetrical base to the leaf blade. The fruit is a dry, nut-like drupe, produced singly in the leaf axils.|$|E
40|$|Parasponia, a woody {{member of}} the <b>elm</b> <b>family,</b> is the only nonlegume genus whose members are known to form an {{effective}} nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with a Rhizobium species. The bacterial strain RP 501 is a slow-growing strain of Rhizobium isolated from Parasponia nodules. Strain RP 501 also nodulates the legumes siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Using a cosmid clone bank of RP 501 DNA, we isolated a 13. 4 -kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment that complemented insertion and point mutations in three contiguous nodulation genes (nodABC) of Rhizobium meliloti, the endosymbiont of alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The complemented R. meliloti nod mutants induced effective nitrogen-fixing nodules on alfalfa seedlings but not on siratro, cowpeas, or Parasponia. The cloned RP 501 nodulation locus hybridized to DNA fragments carrying the R. meliloti nodABC genes. A 3 -kb cluster of Tn 5 insertion mutations on the RP 501 13. 4 -kb EcoRI fragment prevented complementation of R. meliloti nodABC mutations...|$|E

Both clinics have affiliations with the Deakin University School of Medicine through the hosting of third year medical students as part of the Integrated Model of Medical Education in Rural Settings (IMMERSE) program, with The Elms first having a medical student in 2011 and the Bacchus Marsh Medical Centre in 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 1860 a {{rail line}} was {{established}} between Westport and Dodson, and a main stop {{was located in}} Waldo. When the rail line was converted to street cars in 1907, a brick station was built at the Waldo location, and it {{became known as the}} Grand Central Station of Waldo. Waldo was annexed by Kansas City in 1909, which pushed the southern city limit from 49th Street to 77th Street. Business began to grow around the station, including <b>Elmer</b> <b>Family</b> Grocery and Milen Drygoods store. As the growth continued, the Waldo area became a main traffic artery of south Kansas City. Houses on Wornall Road south to 75th Street made way for continued business expansion in the 1930's.|$|R
40|$|Parasponia, a woody {{member of}} the <b>elm</b> <b>family,</b> is the only nonlegume genus whose members are known to form an {{effective}} nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Bradyrhizobium or Rhizobium species. The Bradyrhizobium strain Rp 501, isolated from Parasponia nodules, also nodulates the legumes siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). To test whether {{some of the same}} genes are involved {{in the early stages of}} legume and nonlegume nodulation, we generated transposon Tn 5 insertions in the region of three evolutionarily conserved genes (nodA, nodB, and nodC) required for legume nodulation in several Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species. Assays of these mutant Rp 501 strains on legume hosts and Parasponia seedlings established that nodABC are required for nodulation of legume and nonlegume hosts, indicating that nonlegumes and legumes can respond to the same bacterial signal(s). In addition, a strain carrying a Tn 5 insertion adjacent to the nodABC genes vigorously nodulated Rp 501 legume hosts but was incapable of nodulating Parasponia, possibly identifying a nonlegume-specific nodulation function...|$|E
40|$|Siberian elm is {{a fast-growing}} {{tree in the}} <b>elm</b> <b>family</b> (Ulmaceae) {{distinguished}} by small toothed leaves about 1 - 2 in (3 - 7 cm) long and half as wide, {{and pointed at the}} tip. Unlike other elms, the leaf base is usually symmetrical, forming a nearly even "V". Leaves are smooth and dark green above, paler and nearly hairless beneath, and alternate from side to side along twigs. Mature trees reach a height of 50 - 70 ft. (16 - 22 m.), with a round crown of slender, spreading branches. The bark is rough, gray or brown, and shallowly furrowed at maturity. Twigs are nearly hairless with small, blunt buds. Flowering occurs in the springtime. The small greenish flowers lack petals and occur in drooping clusters of 2 to 5. After flowering, a single seed forms {{in the center of each}} smooth, flattened, circular, in (10 - 15 mm) wide fruit. Other species of elms (Ulmus) and the close relative Zelkova, especially younger plants, look similar to Siberian elm. Some may even confuse it with choke-cherry (Prunus serotina) and hackberry (Celtis sp.). The native slippery elm and American elm typically have leaves that are greater than 3 in (7. 3 cm) long, with unequal heart-shaped leaf bases, and leaf margins with double teeth. ECOLOGICAL THREAT Dry to mesic prairies and stream banks are vulnerable to Siberian elm invasion. Thickets of seedlings soon form around seed-producing trees, bare ground areas, animal and insect mounds, and other disturbed areas. Siberian ElmWin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Netleaf hackberry’s (Celtis reticulata) {{fragmented}} dis-tribution in Idaho {{appears to}} be controlled by a variety of factors. Hackberry is generally restricted to semi-arid portions of the state where temperatures are least severe during the winter months, such as in river canyons and at elevations below 1, 500 m. Hack-berry occurs in a variety of habitats; however, it is most abundant on sites with a southeast to southwesterly aspect and a rocky surface cover. Although seeds have low germination rates and individuals are often slow growing, the variable site conditions which hack-berry tolerates, in addition to its other positive attributes (land-scape structure, wildlife food and cover, resprouting potential), are favorable qualities for rehabilitation species. While experi-mental study plots are needed to test the species ’ ultimate suit-ability for rangeland rehabilitation in Idaho, some general plant-ing recommendations can be made {{based on the results of}} this research combined with field observations. Netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata) is an irregularly shaped deciduous shrub or small tree in the <b>elm</b> <b>family</b> (Ulmaceae) with a wide but fragmented distribution. It occurs in semi-arid regions of the western United States, in portions of the Great Basin, western Great Plains, Pacific Northwest, and southwestern United States (Lanner 1983; Little 1976; Stephens 1973). However, its distribution becomes especially fragmented near its northern limit in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Hackberry occurs in a variety of habitats, including mountain shrub, deciduous riparian woodlands, and live oak-mixed shrub communities, in rocky canyons, and as scattered individuals in semi-desert grasslands, Joshua tree and pinyon-juniper woodlands (Albee and others 1988; Glinski 1977; Plummer 1977). Populations are often small and highly localized (Daubenmire 1970; Dooley and Collins 1984), particularly near its northern limit (Eliot 1938). Little is known about its ecology, presumably due to its position as a minor component in many of its habitats and its fragmented distribution (Lanner 1983) ...|$|E

50|$|Elmer is an elf {{who lives}} with a family of bakers. One day the family bakes a {{blueberry}} pie, which Elmer proceeds to jump into and eats his fill. Upon eating the pie, Elmer {{falls in love with}} blueberry pie and can't wait to get his hands on another one. Unfortunately, the family cannot see him, hear him, or feel him, and he is forced to wait for them to bake another delicious pie. The next week, Elmer notices that they are baking another pie and gets very excited, but is in vain when he smells baking apples. Frustrated with his inability to communicate or be seen by the <b>family,</b> <b>Elmer</b> sets out to try and alert the bakers to his presence. To do this, he begins helping out around the house making beds, washing dishes, and doing other chores to get noticed. Though his efforts are appreciated, the family continues not to notice him and they bake another pie, cherry this time. Deciding he would try to determine whether he likes a different flavored pie better than blueberry, Elmer jumps into the fresh-baked pie and starts eating. Disappointed in the taste, and not realizing that the cherries stained his feet red, Elmer hops out of the pie and walks away. The family notices his footprints and realize that the it was the little elf who had been doing the house work.|$|R
50|$|Edith Finney and Louise Ewing were {{established}} performers {{using the name}} “EdLo Puppets.” Ellen and Romaine “Proctor Puppets” were also well known performers touring throughout the country. They were particularly well-known in Saint Louis for their Christmas performances in the fashionable Scruggs Department Store. Romaine Proctor is credited with designing the puppet Saint Louis on a rearing horse for the guild logo. The Rowlsons traveled and painted wagons. They had a beautiful, “gypsy” wagon that they had designed, and with which they would travel during the summers, painting and performing. Carolyn Meyer was a school teacher and known for her fabulous cardboard shadow puppets with levering mechanisms for more movement. Art Pfaff and his first wife name and upon her death, his second wife, Gladys, were very popular performers with glove and rod puppets. The “Ruth Quinn Marionettes” performed variety acts and she and also created marionettes for other puppeteers across the country. <b>Elmer</b> Kramer and <b>family</b> were also popular puppeteers. Nelly Mendham and Genevieve Albers were renowned for her colorful shadow puppetry. Claude Sontag {{and his wife were}} also popular performers of that era. Mildred (Billie) Blackwell was also a popular puppeteer. The guild successfully brought the 1941 Puppeteers of America Festival to Saint Louis (and 3 others since). The first one being in June 24-27, 1941. It was held at the Melbourne Hotel (Northwest Corner of Grand and Lindell), Saint Louis, Missouri with Romain Proctor as chairman. The next festival was June 25-28, 1947 at Saint Peter’s United Church of Christ? Church Saint Louis and Warne Avenues? Saint Louis, Missouri with Leona Thompson as chairman. The guild published the Puppetry Grapevine, the official publication of the Puppeteers of America…forerunner to The Puppetry Journal. The Puppeteers of America, Inc. also “chartered” guilds who apply and have 10 or more members who are also members of The Puppeteers of America, Inc. In 1963, the Puppet Guild of Saint Louis was granted charter number 17.|$|R
