5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to retain their structural integrity..|$|E

5|$|Tulip mania {{reached its}} peak {{during the winter of}} 1636–37, when some bulbs were {{reportedly}} changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfil any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then at the height of an outbreak of bubonic plague. While the existence of the plague may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place, this outbreak might also <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> to burst the bubble.|$|E
