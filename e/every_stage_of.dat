Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded <b>every</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E

5|$|The {{preliminary}} experimentation for {{the modern}} restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others, who took as their guidelines the Rules for restoration {{of works of art}} as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork.

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for <b>every</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to examine the}} potential of isogeometric methods in the context of multidisciplinary shape optimization. We introduce a shape optimization problem based on a coupled fluid-structure system, whose geometry is defined by NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) curves. This shape optimization problem is then solved by using either an isogeometric approach, or a classical grid-based approach. In {{spite of the fact that}} optimization results do not show any major differences, conceptional advantages of the new isogeometric method become apparent. In particular, control points of the spline can be directly handled as design variables without the need of a spline-fit and consequently geometry errors can be excluded at <b>every</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the optimization loop...|$|R

25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure).

Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at <b>every</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the gait cycle.
