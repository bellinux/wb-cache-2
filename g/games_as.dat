40|$|The media often link Black {{characters}} and violence. This {{is especially true}} in video games, in which Black male characters are virtually always violent. This research tested the effects of playing a violent <b>game</b> <b>as</b> a Black (vs. White) avatar on racial stereotypes and aggression. In Experiment 1, White participants (N = 126) who played a violent video <b>game</b> <b>as</b> a Black avatar displayed stronger implicit and explicit negative attitudes toward Blacks than did participants who played a violent video <b>game</b> <b>as</b> a White avatar or a nonviolent <b>game</b> <b>as</b> a Black or White avatar. In Experiment 2, White participants (N = 141) who played a violent video <b>game</b> <b>as</b> a Black (vs. White) avatar displayed stronger implicit attitudes linking Blacks to weapons. Implicit attitudes, in turn, related to subsequent aggression. Black violent video game avatars not only make players more aggressive than do White avatars, they also reinforce stereotypes that Blacks are violent. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|R
