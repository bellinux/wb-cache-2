25|$|Other similar {{garments}} worn by {{men around}} the world include the Greek and Balkan fustanella (a short flared cotton skirt), the Pacific lava-lava (similar to a sarong), the Fijian sulu vakataga, some forms of Japanese hakama and the Bhutanese gho. The Fijian sulu is a long bark cloth skirt for men as well as women. It is still worn as Fijian national dress, {{in one of the}} more obvious versions of invented traditions, though today the cloth will be cotton or other woven material. A Fijian aristocrat will <b>even</b> <b>wear</b> a pin-stripe sulu to accompany a dress and tie, as full court dress.|$|E
25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and <b>even</b> <b>wear</b> amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The photopigment of the retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E

A guinea pigs' cricket match was in progress, and 20 kittens attended a wedding, wearing little morning suits or brocade dresses, with a feline vicar in white surplice."

2500|$|The {{official}} {{policy of the}} BSA is that any uniform or uniform part which has ever been approved for use, is still acceptable.

They would also wear various disguises to avoid being found out. Mackenberg would sometimes <b>even</b> <b>wear</b> a hearing aid she didn't need.|$|E
2500|$|Flat {{storage is}} the best option for {{exceptionally}} fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres. [...] Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes. [...] The textiles may {{be placed in the}} boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible. [...] If folding becomes necessary, acid-free tissue paper should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming. [...] Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow <b>even</b> <b>wear</b> on the piece.|$|E

2500|$|Pakistan has no laws banning or {{enforcing}} the hijab. Surveys conducted in Pakistan {{show that most}} women wearing the hijab do so of their own choice. The veil is not an absolute requirement, and [...] women may <b>even</b> <b>wear</b> jeans and T-shirts in urban areas of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and other big cities. In last five years, western dressing has become much common among women in cities. Many women wear pants, plazzo and tight jeans with long shirts as well as short shirts. Most women in small cities and rural areas wear the Shalwar Kameez, which consists of a tunic top and baggy trouser set which covers their arms, legs and body. A loose dupatta scarf is also worn around the shoulders, upper chest and head. Men also have a similar dress code, but only women are expected to wear a dupatta in public.|$|E
