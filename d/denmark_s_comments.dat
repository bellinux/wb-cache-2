40|$|On 12 May 1857, Edward Sieveking read a {{paper on}} {{epilepsy}} to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in London. During the discussion that followed Sir Charles Locock, obstetrician to Queen Victoria, {{was reported to have}} commented that during the past 14 months he had used potassium bromide to successfully stop epileptic seizures in all but one of 14 or 15 women with 2 ̆ 7 hysterical 2 ̆ 7 or catamenial epilepsy. This report of Locock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comment</b> has generally given him credit for introducing the first reasonably effective antiepileptic drug into medical practice. However examination of the original reports raises questions as to how soundly based the accounts of Locock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> were.

While some important issues are raised, the main thrust of Barrett 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> is quite misplaced. The poverty line methodology he criticises is the one widely employed by economists in all developed countries; his attack on the reliability of the income distribution is based on inappropriate evidence; his assessment of the effects of including non-cash benefits is severely flawed, and he confuses measurement of the overall redistributive impact of state policy and measurement of poverty...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{powerful}} political and organizational leaders {{have been described as}} being charismatic. With technology 2 ̆ 7 s increasing impact on society, these leaders have widespread access to the masses. Utilizing charismatic leadership and media saliency theories, this study aims to analyze the impact that occurred in the Las Vegas convention industry after the President made specific comments concerning Las Vegas. These comments implied that convention spending in Las Vegas was wasteful, and resulted in the cancellation or relocation of over 400 conventions in one week. This research utilizes monthly, aggregate convention data from January 2002 to March 2014 to evaluate the impact of this comment empirically.
