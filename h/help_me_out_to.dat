A pesquisa foi realizada na sala de aula, onde atuei como professora, compartilhando com Vygostky (1984) que, para se entender algo (neste caso, as práticas de leitura e escrita) é necessário estudá-lo nas dinâmicas das relações, mergulhada no processo, ou ainda, no movimento. Tendo como referencial teórico os estudos da história {{cultural}} (CHARTIER: 1996; HÉBRARD; 1996; FRAISSE: 1997), debrucei-me sobre os modelos históricos que circunscrevem as práticas de leitura e escrita, reconhecendo os vestígios acerca destas apropriações, pelos sujeitos dentro e fora da escola. Através dos relatos das crianças e da família, fui apurando meu olhar para os mediadores envolvidos neste processo: a oralidade, a materialidade do livro e a imagem. No percurso deste trabalho, observei ainda que as crianças respondem ao modelo escolar, burlando-o, apropriando-se das práticas de leitura e escrita de modo singular e compartilhado ao mesmo tempo. Palavras-chave Práticas; Leitura; Escrita Abstract This {{paper has}} as its main subject to present the different elements that <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> teach children towards the reading and writing practices. The research {{was carried out in}} the classroom, were I accomplish my work as a teacher, following the principles of Vygostky (1984) who asserts the importance of analysing the process in its own dynamic, ob serving the changes during the moment when it happens. As theoretical reference I had for this study the works on cultural history (CHARTIER: 1996; HÉBRARD: 1996; FRAISSE: 1997) and I concentrated on historical models involving reading and writing practices, identifying traces of this founding in the students inside and outside the school. Analysing the reports of the children and their families, I was able to improve my view on the other elements in this process: the oral communication, the book, and the image. In the course of this research I have noticed that the children’s answer to the school pattern, is to deceit it, and they end up appropriating the reading and writing practices in a singular, and at the same time, in a partaken way.

If I can't be content and comfortable in this here lively Dragon now, is it to be looked for as I should be then? By no means. Very good. Then you, even with your good humour, would be always on the fret and worrit, always uncomfortable in your own mind, always a-thinking as you was getting too old for my taste, always a-picturing me to yourself as being chained up to the Dragon door, and wanting to break away. I don't know {{that it would be}} so,' said Mark, 'but I don't know that it mightn't be. I am a roving sort of chap, I know. I'm fond of change. I'm always a-thinking that with my good health and spirits it would be more creditable in me to be jolly where there's things a-going on to make one dismal.

I am honored that I was given the opportunity to work in this group. Thank a lot for all the help and support!

I learned a lot from all of you, thanks...|$|R

They were both the hardest and easiest scenes I've ever had to do, because the situation was so sad. I was absolutely emotionally drained {{at the end of it}} all. The midwife has a lot of experience of attending stillbirths, and she <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> work <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> play it so that it seems real. It scared me personally, though, because the idea of going through something like that is petrifying. They were the most challenging scenes I've ever done." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{continued}} importuning {{me several}} days, {{but it was}} impossible, I told her, for me to commit the secret to anybody. This, instead of being an answer to her, increased her importunities; she urged her having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature, {{that it was her}} business to conceal everything, and that to discover things of that nature would be her ruin. She asked me if ever I had found her tattling to me of other people's affairs, and how could I suspect her? She told me, to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody; that she was silent as death; that it must be a very strange case indeed that she could not <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> of; but <b>to</b> conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible help, or means of help, and to deprive her of the opportunity of serving me. In short, she had such a bewitching eloquence, and so great a power of persuasion that there was no concealing anything from her.|$|R

Obviously I couldn't have done this without an advisor and, in {{addition}} to this, I'd like to thank Jordan for the many useful comments he had, especially on how to spin my papers. All the members of the DEMO lab (1996 - 2002) contributed in some way to my thesis, but {{there are a couple of}} people I'd like <b>to</b> single <b>out.</b> First, Hod Lipson <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> gure <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> use the 3 D printer, he built my rst two robots, and then was of invaluable help through the questions he asked and the data he wanted when we wrote our two papers together. Our journal paper became the framework for supporting the claims of this dissertation. Next, Richard Watson, Shiva Viswanathan and John Rie el (who helped build my third robot) gave me very useful feedback in reading over my papers and thesis, and everyone in the group had something to say in my group presentations. I'd like to thank my committee for the comments the gave me on my dissertation and for their time, and I'd like to thank Mei Xiu for the biology references. Finally, I want to thank my parents, family and friends for their love and support...|$|R

It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys have <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> figure <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> do that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|R

Employers now hope to find sources of creativity in everything a candidate does, including their portfolio and one’s personal brand as reflected through social media accounts and professional websites. Through my honors research I will investigate what makes a strong personal brand and how to use social media to promote oneself as an artist. By conducting research on other artist’s personal brands I was able to create a list of strengths and weaknesses to consider in creating my own personal brand. I compared and contrasted multiple design and artist blogs’ for tips and techniques. In figuring out my own personal brand I reflected on what I wanted the brand to represent, what I thought other people would associate with the brand, and who my target audience would be. The main elements of my brand include my signature and hand icons represent my personality and my design philosophy. My philosophy is to build relationships with people, brands, and companies that have tremendous stories and then use my creativity to help them share their ideas, hard work, and experiences with the world in a captivating, relatable, and very visual way. My hands are my most important tool when it comes to creating and it was important to me to use my hands as a way to tell a story. The next phase of the project was to implicate all of the research and strategy. Once all the web domains were registered, I applied the brand elements and set brand guidelines. Through the use of social media I would showcase my work, build relationships with followers, and share sources of inspiration. Based off of my previous research and with these ideas in place, I created a calendar and then began to build a social media strategy using a company called Hootsuite. This allows me to keep up and continue building my personal brand in the future. The resources provided by Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook will allow me to continue to monitor the overall success of my strategy and in time will prove whether it’s been successful or not. The experience of building a personal brand will not only <b>help</b> <b>me</b> stand <b>out</b> <b>to</b> future employers but has also provided a deeper understanding to the marketing and business side of promoting myself as an artist...|$|R
