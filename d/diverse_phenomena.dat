25|$|Maxwell's {{equations}} are partial {{differential equations}} that relate the electric and magnetic fields {{to each other}} and to the electric charges and currents.

2500|$|Many {{fundamental}} laws {{of physics}} and chemistry can be formulated as differential equations. In biology and economics, differential equations are used to model the behavior of complex systems. The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations {{can be viewed as}} a unifying principle behind <b>diverse</b> <b>phenomena.</b> As an example, consider propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order partial differential equation, the wave equation, which allows us to think of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by Joseph Fourier, is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the heat equation. It turns out that many diffusion processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; [...] the Black–Scholes equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.|$|E

The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this {{contribution}} {{the current}} state of knowledge about the highvelocity clouds (HVCs) is summarized. Recent progress has shown that the HVCs are a <b>diverse</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> The intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) are likely {{to be part of a}} Galactic Fountain. The Magellanic Stream is a tidal remnant. HVC complex C (possibly complexes A and GCN) are low-metallicity clouds near the Galaxy; they could be remnants of the formation of the Galaxy or old tidal streams extracted from nearby dwarf galaxies. Having a substantial number of HI HVCs dispersed throughout the Local Group seems incompatible with the observed HI mass function of galaxies. Finally, FUSE finds high-velocity OVI, some of which is clearly associated with HI HVCs, but some which is not. ...|$|R
40|$|Depression is {{now widely}} {{regarded}} as a common disabling disorder that affects negatively the social functioning all over the world. Depression is associated with <b>diverse</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in brain such as neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive deficit. Recent studies reported that depression occurs by various metabolic changes, leading to metabolic syndrome. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylases, known to regulate diverse biological mechanism such as longevity, genomic stability, and inflammation. The modulation of sirtuin activity has been highlighted as a promising approach to reduce neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we summarize the recent discoveries regarding the potential relationship between sirtuins and depression caused by metabolic disorders. Ultimately, we suggest the possibility that sirtuins will be novel targets to alleviate neuropathogenesis induced by depression...|$|R
