40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{the construction of a}} corrective surface in theMoldova area for further conversion of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>heights</b> into normal heights. For thispurpose a detailed analysis of the optimal combination of heterogeneous height data ispresented, with particular emphasis on (i) modeling systematic errors and datuminconsistencies, (ii) separation of random errors and estimation of variance componentsfor each height type, and (iii) practical considerations for modernizing vertical controlsystems. Although the theoretical relationship between <b>geodetic,</b> normal <b>heights</b> andheight anomalies is simple in nature, its practical implementation has proven to be quitechallenging due to numerous factors that cause discrepancies among the combined heightdata. In addition, variance component estimation is applied to the common adjustment ofthe heterogeneous heights. This leads to the connection between the proper modelling ofsystematic errors and datum inconsistencies with the estimated variance components. Ultimately, one of the main motivations for this work is the need to introduce moderntools and techniques, such as GPS/levelling, in establishing a vertical control. Therefore,part of this thesis is aimed at bringing to the forefront some of the key issues that affectthe achievable accuracy level of GPS/levelling. Overall, the analysis of the optimalcombination of the heterogeneous height data conducted herein provides valuable insightto be used for a variety of height related applications...|$|R

40|$|Secor {{observations}} {{have defined}} a geodetic network extending through the Pacific Ocean from Japan, with three stations on the Japanese datum, {{to the west}} coast of the United States. Thus this network was connected to major datums on both ends. However, observations on Geos 1 were taken only {{in the middle of the}} network, from Truk Island to Maui, so that the network determined by Geos 1 observations alone is not directly attached to any major geodetic datum. A little-known procedure called 'inner adjustment' was found to be the appropriate method to define a coordinate system for the adjustment of the isolated network and to determine the inner consistency of the observations. The network was indirectly tied to the North American datum by the use of (1) satellite observing stations of other observing systems whose coordinates were previously determined, (2) relative positions of these and nearby Secor stations, as determined by local surveys, and (3) <b>geodetic</b> <b>heights</b> composed of leveled (orthometric) heights plus geoid heights obtained from a geoid map...|$|R

The software package SHGEO developed by the University of New Brunswick, Canada, {{was used for the}} calculation. The geoid model was derived by using the following data: digital terrain model SRTM 3 (Shuttle Recovery Topography Mission) version 2. 0 with 3 " grid, the geopotential model EIGEN-GL 04 S 1, degree and order 150, derived from GRACE satellite, and terrestrial gravity data basically observed along the rivers.

40|$|To {{formulate}} {{the fundamental}} formula of physical geodesy at the physical {{surface of the}} Earth, the gravity anomalies are used instead of the gravity disturbances, because the <b>geodetic</b> <b>heights</b> above the geocentric reference ellipsoid are not usually available. The relation between the gravity anomaly and the gravity disturbance {{is defined as a}} product of the normal gravity gradient referred to the telluroid and the height anomaly according to Molodensky's theory of the normal heights (Molodensky, 1945; Molodensky et al., 1960). Considering the normal gravity gradient referred {{to the surface of the}} geocentric reference ellipsoid, this relation is redefined as a function of the normal height (Vanícek et al., 1999). When the orthometric heights are practically used for the realization of the vertical datum, the geoid-quasigeoid correction is applied to the fundamental formula of physical geodesy to determine the precise geoid. Theoretical formulation of the geoid-quasigeoid correction to the fundamental formula of physical geodesy can be found in Martinec (1993) and Vanícek et al. (1999). In this paper, the numerical investigation of this correction at the territory of Canada is shown and the error analysis is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Most {{developing}} countries like Ghana {{are yet to}} adopt the geocentric datum for its surveying and mapping purposes. It is well known and documented that non-geocentric datums based on its establishment have more distortions in height compared with satellite datums. Most authors have argued that combining such height with horizontal positions (latitude and longitude) in the transformation process could introduce unwanted distortions to the network. This is because the local <b>geodetic</b> <b>height</b> in most cases {{is assumed to be}} determined to a lower accuracy compared with the horizontal positions. In the light of this, a transformation model was proposed by Featherstone and Vaníček (1999) which avoids the use of height in both global and local datums in coordinate transformation. It was confirmed that adopting such a method reduces the effect of distortions caused by <b>geodetic</b> <b>height</b> on the transformation parameters estimated. Therefore, this paper applied Featherstone and Vaníček (FV) model {{for the first time to}} a set of common points coordinates in Ghana geodetic reference network. The FV model was used to transform coordinates from global datum (WGS 84) to local datum (Accra datum). The results obtained based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in both Eastings and Northings were satisfactory. Thus, a RMSE value of 0. 66 m and 0. 96 m were obtained for the Eastings and Northings while 0. 76 m and 0. 73 m were the MAE values achieved. Also, the FV model attained a transformation accuracy of 0. 49 m. Hence, this study will serve as a preliminary investigation in avoiding the use of height in coordinate transformation within Ghana’s geodetic reference network...|$|E

It {{depends on the}} extent of area, required accuracy, delivery time, financial resources and technologies available. The first model covering the whole territory of the Czech Republic was created already in the early 1980 's. Currently, the 5 th DEM generation is being finished. Data collection for this model was realized using the airborne laser scanning which allowed creating the DEM of a new generation having the precision up to a decimetre. Model of such a precision expands the possibilities of employing the DEM and it also offers new opportunities for the use of elevation data especially in a domain of modelling the phenomena dependent on highly accurate data. The examples are precise modelling of hydrological phenomena, studying micro-relief objects, modelling the vehicle movement, detecting and describing historical changes of a landscape, designing constructions etc. Due to a nature of the technology used for collecting data and generating DEM, it is assumed that the resulting model achieves lower accuracy in areas covered by vegetation and in built-up areas. Therefore the verification of model accuracy was carried out in five selected areas in Moravia. The network of check points was established using a total station in each area. To determine the reference heights of check points, the known <b>geodetic</b> points whose <b>heights</b> were defined using levelling were used. Up to several thousands of points were surveyed in each area.

Results of the analysis showed that the model reaches generally higher precision than the declared one in majority of areas. This applies in particular to areas covered by vegetation. By contrast, the larger deviations occurred in relation to the slope of the terrain, in particular in the micro-relief objects. The results are presented in this article...|$|R

Geoid height reference surface for Latvia of the precision of RMS 1. 6 cm was obtained; (2) selective examination of the distorsions of national and local <b>geodetic</b> <b>height</b> reference network; (3) {{the analysis of the}} GNSS permanent station observation data time series and station displacements affected by Earth tides for period of 5 years; (4) the success of development of digital zenith camera for vertical deflection and application fer geoid model improvement. The interpretation of the achieved results and the discussion on the mutual agreement and disagreement of the obtained results will be presented. Acknowledgement.

In {{addition to the}} earth's natural or physical surface, these include a geometric or mathematical figure of the earth taken to be an equipotential ellipsoid of revolution (Chapter 3), and a second equipotential surface or figure of the earth, the geoid. The geoid is defined as that particular equipotential {{surface of the earth}} that coincides with mean sea level over the oceans and extends hypothetically beneath all land surfaces. In a mathematical sense, the geoid is also defined as so many meters above (+N) or below (-N) the ellipsoid (Figure 6. 1). In Figure 6. 1 and in subsequent figures and equations, the difference n direction between the geodetic normal and the vertical is ignored due to its insignificance to the topic discussed here. The first definit on of the geoid has great practical importance since it refers to the hypothetical extension of mean sea level (the geoid) beneath land surfaces. In this capacity, the geoid serves not only as the vertical datum (reference surface) for height-above-mean sea level (h) values in areas where elevation data is not available from conventional leveling, but is fundamental to the determination of the h-values themselves. This is apparent from the Equationsand Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3, where: H = <b>geodetic</b> <b>height</b> = height above the ellipsoid* N = geoid height h = height-above-mean sea level, Figures 6. 2 and 6. 3 illustrate the use of geoid heights in the determination of h-values from geodetic heights derived using satellite receivers (e. g., NAVSTAR GPS receivers) located on the earth's physical surface and aboard a vehicle operating near the earth (or in space), respectively. In particular, {{it is easy to see}} from Figure 6. 2 how geoid heights (N) position the geoid with respect to the ellipsoid where the former can then serve as the vertical datum for the height-above-mean sea level values which the N-values also helped determine. It is hard to over-estimate the importance of the geoid in this dual role. In some parts of the world, the elevation data appearing on maps and charts was obtained via this geoid-related approach. In land areas where heights-above-mean sea level are available from conventional leveling, the geoid, as determined herein, is not needed as the vertical datum (reference surface) for these h-values...|$|E

This {{is an important issue}} because of the pressures that an increasing population and economic growth have put on limited land resources. Matter-element theory, which was first put forward by the Chinese mathematician Cai Wen, has shown potential for solving incompatibility problems. Based on the matter-element model, this paper uses land use, roads, water bodies, population density, distance from center of the city, <b>geodetic</b> <b>height,</b> and slope as factors in modeling land suitability for development. Zengcheng, an urban-rural administration was used as a case study for applying the matter-element model to assessing the suitability of land for development. The model was cross referenced with local urban plans for verification and {{the results of this study}} show that the model constructed was effective at assessing the suitability of land for development. According to both the classification map created using the matter-element model and the statistics on the of land suitability classes, the study area was found to have a considerable amount of land which is highly suitable for development. After the category 'highly suitable', the next largest total land area was in the category of 'not suitable' for development, while there was relatively little land classified as moderately and marginally suitable. The percentage of the total land area of each class of suitability was 41. 80 %, 34. 22 %, 16. 35 % and 7. 64 %, respectively. Apart from this, the study also demonstrated the advantage of matter-element models over fuzzy theory, as they provide much more information. For example, all integrated degree of all classes in the paper had ranges from - 1 to 1, but differed from each other by percentage. In the category of 'highly suitable' only 45. 51 % of matter-elements fully conformed to the criteria (those within a range of 0 - 0. 5925), while the remainder (54. 49 %) did not corresponded to the requirements of the category, but did have the potential to do so with relatively few changes (those within a range of - 0. 3923 - 0 degrees). This data provides us with an understanding of the potential and limitation to development of the land in the region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
