5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|In March 1460 Warwick visited York in Ireland to {{plan the}} way ahead, and {{returned}} to Calais. Then, on 26June, he landed at Sandwich with Salisbury and March, and from here the three earls rode north to London. Salisbury was left to besiege the Tower of London, while Warwick took March with him <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king. At Northampton, on 10July, King Henry was taken captive, while the Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at {{a bend in the}} Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E

5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E
5|$|Guo Xiaoke, who had led {{the first}} Tang {{campaign}} against Karasahr in 644, was installed in Kucha as protector-general of the Anxi Protectorate, or the Protectorate of the Pacified West. The headquarters of the protector-general was thus moved from its original location in Gaochang to Kucha. While Ashina was <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kuchean king, Nali, a Kuchean lord, traveled to request {{the help of the}} Western Turks. Guo was assassinated after the Kuchean soldiers retook the kingdom with the military assistance of the Western Turks. Ashina returned to Kucha, captured five of the kingdom's cities, and forced the remaining cities to surrender. Tang control was re-established in the oasis state. The brother of the former king, a yabgu or viceroy, was enthroned by the Chinese as a subject of the Tang empire.|$|E
5|$|Hipper {{set sail}} on 15 December for another raid and {{successfully}} bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet {{in the early}} morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but he turned <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that Scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.|$|E

Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds. Later, Xehanort's apprentice Vanitas convinces Ventus to follow Terra against Eraqus' wishes, while Eraqus orders Aqua to watch over Terra and bring Ventus back to the Land of Departure.|$|E
5|$|In the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front was {{tasked with}} driving into East Prussia from the east. The 31st Army {{was not on}} an assault sector, {{and in the first}} stages it was ordered to hold its {{positions}} stubbornly. By January 23–24, the 331st had joined <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retreating German forces, and along with its corps helped capture the important road junction of Blenkheim, and the strongpoint of Treuburg on the approaches to Lötzen. However, {{in the first week of}} February, the German command had regrouped their 129th and 558th Infantry Divisions as well as units of the 24th Panzer Division, which counterattacked in an attempt to encircle units of the 71st Rifle Corps; after several days fighting the attacks were beaten back and the advance resumed towards Kanditten.|$|E

5|$|Still <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{debris of}} the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be}} a much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit {{of the enemy}}. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E

The airstrike caught the Saigon garrison off guard and, in the confusion, {{they were unable to}} determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces. Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from Bien Hoa Air Base <b>in</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.|$|E
