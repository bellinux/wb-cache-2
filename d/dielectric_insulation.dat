40|$|Ageing {{processes}} typically {{associated with}} the <b>dielectric</b> and <b>insulation</b> system occur inside high voltage plant.

40|$|Flexoelectricity is a {{property}} of all dielectric materials whereby they polarize {{in response to}} deformation gradients such as those produced by bending. Although it is generally thought of as {{a property}} of <b>dielectric</b> insulators, <b>insulation</b> is not a formal requirement: in principle, semiconductors can also redistribute their free charge in response to strain gradients. Here we show that bending a semiconductor not only generates a flexoelectric-like response, but that this response can in fact be much larger than in insulators. By doping single crystals of wide-bandgap oxides to increase their conductivity, their effective flexoelectric coefficient was increased by orders of magnitude. This large response can be explained by a barrier-layer mechanism that remains important even at the macroscale, where conventional (insulator) flexoelectricity otherwise tends to be small.
