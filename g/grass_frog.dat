5|$|Since European {{settlement}} {{the area}} has been subdivided, settled and farmed. A traveller in 1855 noted that the area was highly cultivated. The endangered Growling <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (Litoria raniformis) has been sighted, though {{there is only a}} single record. In some undisturbed areas there is Poa labillardierei (silver tussock) grassland and Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass). Glycine latrobeana (clover glycine) was recorded south of the town in 1984. Discaria pubescens (Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant), which appears on the states endangered species list, was recorded north-east in 2001 on the South Esk River's floodplain. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Platypus in the river have, in common with in other rivers nearby, been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor amphiborum.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog was first {{described}} as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827. It has changed classification 20 times; {{it was first}} named Litoria aurea in 1844 by Günther, and changed another 9 times before being named again as Litoria aurea. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Litoria aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the Litoria genus. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of the green and golden bell frog (L. aurea), growling <b>grass</b> <b>frog</b> (L. raniformis), yellow-spotted bell frog (L. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (L. dahlii), spotted-thighed frog (L. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (L. moorei). The ranges of L. raniformis and L. castanea overlap with the green and golden bell frog; this, {{as well as physical}} similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, L. raniformis and the green and golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog has not been seen since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from the green and golden bell frog. The growling <b>grass</b> <b>frog,</b> which is very similar to the green and golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised bumps on the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of L. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, L. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{peninsula}} {{also supports}} the Black Swamp Wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), Cape Barren Goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae), Short-beaked Echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), Copperhead Snake (Austrelaps superbus), Blotched Blue-tongued Lizard (Tiliqua nigrolutea) and the threatened Growling <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (Litoria raniformis) found at Swan Lake. Surrounding waters are a feeding {{area for the}} Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) listed as vulnerable in Australia under the EPBC Act.|$|E

50|$|The site {{is home to}} red-necked {{wallabies}} {{and common}} wombats at the extreme western limit of their range. Rosenberg's goannas are present. Growling <b>grass</b> <b>frogs</b> and Yarra pygmy perch have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Ptychadena is a genus {{of frogs}} in the Ptychadenidae family, the {{grassland}} frogs. They are distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa {{as well as}} nilotic Egypt. The common names of this genus are ridged <b>frogs</b> and <b>grass</b> <b>frogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} smaller than most other Ptychadena species. It {{is similar to the}} Sharp-nosed <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (P. oxyrhynchus). It is less {{conspicuous}} than the Plain <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (P. anchietae) and hides by day, calling from concealed positions. Previously considered a race of the Mascarene <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (Rana mascarenienis mossambica Loveridge); the length from the heel to the toes in P. mascareniensis is greater than the length of the tibia. The Dwarf <b>Grass</b> <b>Frog</b> (P. taenioscelis) is smaller (less than 35 mm), with stripes down the backside of the thighs.|$|E
50|$|The Mozambique ridged frog (Ptychadena mossambica, {{also known}} as the broad-banded <b>grass</b> <b>frog,</b> Mozambique <b>grass</b> <b>frog,</b> Mozambique {{grassland}} frog, or single-striped <b>grass</b> <b>frog)</b> is a species of frog in the Ptychadenidae family. These frogs can swim fairly well, jump far and can crawl with ease through dense plants. Their strong hindlegs can launch them up to three metres into the air in a single bound.|$|E
50|$|Strongylopus fasciatus, {{also known}} as the striped stream frog, striped <b>grass</b> <b>frog,</b> striped rana, striped long-toed frog or long-toed <b>grass</b> <b>frog</b> , is a species of frog in the family Pyxicephalidae. It is endemic to {{southern}} Africa.|$|E
60|$|Insects {{were singing}} in the <b>grass.</b> <b>Frogs</b> with {{deepening}} chorus seemed to announce the coming of night, and above these peaceful sounds came the wild shouts of the far-off preacher, echoing through the cool green arches of the splendid grove.|$|R

25|$|The {{rural areas}} of Park Orchards, the bushland from Tindalls Road to Reynolds Road, the Currawong Bush Park, the {{regenerated}} bushland near Larnoo Drive at Donvale all provide wonderful bushland habitat and a very significant linear open space. Small tributaries with wetlands, ferns and growling <b>grass</b> <b>frogs</b> link to the Mullum at Currawong Bush Park. Kangaroos, koalas and echidnas are permanent residents in the area, and platypus live in the Creek. The last major tributary, that forms {{the valley of the}} Green Gully Linear Park, joins the Mullum Mullum Creek, near Tikalara Park, just opposite the new parklands within the subdivision as the end of Blackburn Road.|$|R
50|$|Muskrats live in {{and around}} Weed Lake. They weigh {{approximately}} 2 kg. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair and, to aid them in swimming, are slightly flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. After they breed, the mother muskrat has 2-9 babies. The baby muskrats leave their family and nest when they are about 20 days old. They often travel and move homes. To find them you must go to wetlands like marshes and bogs. They like to eat insects, cattails, sedges, rushes, pondweeds, <b>grass,</b> <b>frogs,</b> snails, and fish. Muskrats’ predators include wolves, coyotes, and foxes. People usually don’t set traps or choose to hunt muskrats. What makes them interesting {{is that they have}} amazing eyes that can see far. Their legs are also very fast with very sharp nails.|$|R
50|$|St. Peter-Ording is {{situated}} on the North Sea coast, on the western tip of the Eiderstedt peninsula, approx. 45 km southwest of Husum. Part of the municipality lies in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. Its characteristics include a beach that is approximately 12 kilometers long and up to one kilometre wide, the dunes, the salt meadows and the cultivated forested areas, atypical for this region. The salt meadows are of special ecological importance, since they belong to the few salt meadows that remain in their natural state. In contrast to other salt meadows along the North Sea they contain numerous ponds and puddles. The landward side is flooded with sea water only occasionally and not every year, so that amphibians such as <b>grass</b> <b>frogs,</b> moor frogs and toads (Bufo bufo) live uncharacteristically close to the seashore. Even the Natterjack Toad (Bufo calamita) is able to reproduce successfully in this environment.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Changes in {{the amounts}} of tubulin, actin, and {{neurofilament}} polypeptides were found in regenerating motoneurons of <b>grass</b> <b>frogs</b> {{during the period of}} axonal elongation. Ventrat roots 9 and 10 were transected unilaterally about 7 mm from the spinal cord. 35 d later, [3 H]colchicine binding had decreased in the proximal stumps to approximately one-half of contralateral control values, well before the regenerating motor axons had reinnervated skeletal muscles of the hind limb. [3 H]colchicine binding did not change significantly in the operated halves of the 9 th and 10 th spinal cord segments over a 75 -d period. The relative amounts of actin, tubulin, and neurofitament polypeptides in the operated ventral roots were measured by quantitative densitometry of stained two-dimensional electrophoretic gels. AIpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, and the 68, 000 molecular weight subunit of neurofilaments (NF 68) decreased within the transected ventral roots to 78 %, 57 %, and < 15 % of control values, respectively. The amount of actin increased to 132 % of control values within the operated ventral roots, although this change was not statistically significant. Opposite changes were found within motoneuronal cell bodies isolated from the spinal cord.
