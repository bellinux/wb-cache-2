25|$|In {{specular}} reflection, {{the direction}} of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the <b>incident</b> <b>ray</b> makes with the surface normal, a line perpendicular to the surface {{at the point where the}} ray hits. The incident and reflected rays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the <b>incident</b> <b>ray</b> and the normal. This is known as the Law of Reflection.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law is {{generally}} true only for isotropic or specular media (such as glass). In anisotropic media such as some crystals, birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays, the ordinary or o-ray which follows Snell's law, {{and the other}} extraordinary or e-ray {{which may not be}} co-planar with the <b>incident</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The factor {{multiplying}} [...] is the sine of {{angle of}} the <b>incident</b> <b>ray</b> with the x axis, and the factor multiplying [...] is the sine of {{angle of the}} refracted ray with the x axis. [...] Snell's law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell's law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length.|$|E

2500|$|Let us suppose {{now that}} {{there is at least}} a {{positive}} solution, and let [...] be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of reflection state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the <b>incident</b> <b>ray</b> and the normal to the sphere.|$|E
60|$|If the refracted Ray be {{returned}} directly {{back to the}} Point of Incidence, it shall be refracted into the Line before described by the <b>incident</b> <b>Ray.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Angle of Incidence is that Angle, {{which the}} Line {{described}} by the <b>incident</b> <b>Ray</b> contains with the Perpendicular to the reflecting or refracting Surface at the Point of Incidence.|$|E
60|$|So {{then the}} Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence flow from or towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction flow from or towards the Point q {{found by the}} {{foregoing}} Rules. And if the <b>incident</b> <b>Rays</b> flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or refracted Rays shall flow from or towards so many other Points q found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays flow from or towards the Point q is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point {{be on the same}} side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the <b>incident</b> <b>Rays</b> flow from the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point q and the refracted from it; and if the <b>incident</b> <b>Rays</b> flow towards Q, the reflected flow from q, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary happens when q is on the other side of the Surface.|$|R

6000|$|This Bow never appears, {{but where}} it rains in the Sun-shine, {{and may be}} made artificially by {{spouting}} up Water which may break aloft, and scatter into Drops, and fall down like Rain. For the Sun shining upon these Drops certainly causes the Bow to appear to a Spectator standing in a due Position to the Rain and Sun. And hence it is now agreed upon, that this Bow is made by Refraction of the Sun's Light in drops of falling Rain. This was understood {{by some of the}} Antients, and of late more fully discover'd and explain'd by the famous Antonius de Dominis Archbishop of Spalato, in his book De Radiis Visûs & Lucis, published by his Friend Bartolus at Venice, in the Year 1611, and written above 20 Years before. For he teaches there how the interior Bow is made in round Drops of Rain by two Refractions of the Sun's Light, and one Reflexion between them, and the exterior by two Refractions, and two sorts of Reflexions between them in each Drop of Water, and proves his Explications by Experiments made with a Phial full of Water, and with Globes of Glass filled with Water, and placed in the Sun to make the Colours of the two Bows appear in them. The same Explication Des-Cartes hath pursued in his Meteors, and mended that of the exterior Bow. But whilst they understood not the true Origin of Colours, it's necessary to pursue it here a little farther. For understanding therefore how the Bow is made, let a Drop of Rain, or any other spherical transparent Body be represented by the Sphere BNFG, [in Fig. 14.] described with the Center C, and Semi-diameter CN. And let AN be one of the Sun's Rays incident upon it at N, and thence refracted to F, where let it either go out of the Sphere by Refraction towards V, or be reflected to G; and at G let it either go out by Refraction to R, or be reflected to H; and at H let it go out by Refraction towards S, cutting the <b>incident</b> <b>Ray</b> in Y. Produce AN and RG, till they meet in X, and upon AX and NF, let fall the Perpendiculars CD and CE, and produce CD till it fall upon the Circumference at L. Parallel to the <b>incident</b> <b>Ray</b> AN draw the Diameter BQ, and let the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Water be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R. Now, if you suppose the Point of Incidence N to move from the Point B, continually till it come to L, the Arch QF will first increase and then decrease, and so will the Angle AXR which the Rays AN and GR contain; and the Arch QF and Angle AXR will be biggest when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(3)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 2R to I. Also the Angle AYS, which the Rays AN and HS contain will first decrease, and then increase and grow least when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(8)RR, in which case NE will be to ND, as 3R to I. And so the Angle which the next emergent Ray (that is, the emergent Ray after three Reflexions) contains with the <b>incident</b> <b>Ray</b> AN will come to its Limit when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(15)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 4R to I. And the Angle which the Ray next after that Emergent, that is, the Ray emergent after four Reflexions, contains with the Incident, will come to its Limit, when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(24)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 5R to I; and so on infinitely, the Numbers 3, 8, 15, 24, &c. being gather'd by continual Addition of the Terms of the arithmetical Progression 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. The Truth of all this Mathematicians will easily examine.[M] ...|$|E

60|$|In like manner, {{if there}} be a Prism of Glass (that is, a Glass bounded with two Equal and Parallel Triangular ends, and three plain and well {{polished}} Sides, which meet in three Parallel Lines running from the three Angles of {{one end to the}} three Angles of the other end) and if the Refraction of the Light in passing cross this Prism be desired: Let ACB [in Fig. 2.] represent a Plane cutting this Prism transversly to its three Parallel lines or edges there where the Light passeth through it, and let DE be the Ray incident upon the first side of the Prism AC where the Light goes into the Glass; and by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11 find EF the first refracted Ray. Then taking this Ray for the <b>Incident</b> <b>Ray</b> upon the second side of the Glass BC where the Light goes out, find the next refracted Ray FG by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17. For if the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Glass be to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11, the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air must on the contrary be to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17, by the third Axiom.|$|E
50|$|Specular {{reflection}}, {{also known}} as regular reflection, is the mirror-like reflection of waves, such as light, from a surface.
