5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> her.|$|E

Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|As an {{adolescent}} during the 1950s, Hendrix {{became interested in}} rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In 1968, he told Guitar Player magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B.B. King inspired him during {{the beginning of his}} career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: [...] "I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> me to death because I heard all of these sounds." [...] In 1970, he told Rolling Stone that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E

500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, [...] "I remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> the dickens out of me—just her tone. I {{never wanted to be}} {{on the wrong side of}} her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E
500|$|After the incident, Brodevik {{described}} his {{and the other}} band member's situation as [...] "trapped like rats." [...] While {{he said that the}} band is used to hatred from the extreme metal community toward the Bible and Christianity, nothing like this had ever happened to the band before. Aanonsen, the bassist and a father of three, explained that while he understood that the tour could have ended in death for him and the other band members, when violence finally broke out a Belo Horizonte he remained completely, unexpectedly calm. In retrospect he remarked that while <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> him, the concert in Belo Horizonte was the best he has ever experienced, as all attendees [...] "defied so much" [...] to get to it. He also noted that because of the attack, the band is now [...] "twice as big" [...] in Brazil as it had been before the incident.

500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> the horses. However, the snow falling from {{the sky was a}} foam substance. The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) to just be the [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|E
500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E

So, {{a lot depends on}} Japan, frankly... I think if it does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that." [...] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made, by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession. Sam Elliott, however, stated, [...] "The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> New Line off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed {{to be the subject}} of her song [...] "Herrmann Hiess Er" [...] (English title [...] "Herrmann Was His Name") from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. [...] "It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him to tell everybody. I admit that <b>it</b> <b>scared</b> me that my popularity could make people start using drugs," [...] he once said in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. <b>It</b> <b>scared</b> me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because it scares me so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E

2500|$|More recently, the J. Edgar Hoover Building {{has been}} {{strongly}} criticized for its aesthetics and {{impact on the}} urban life in the city. In 2005, D.C. architect Arthur Cotton Moore harshly condemned the building for creating a dead space {{in the heart of}} the nation's capital. [...] "It creates a void along Pennsylvania Avenue. Given its elephantine size and harshness, it creates a black hole. Its concrete wall, with no windows or life to it, is an urban sin. People should be strolling down America's main street. Nobody strolls in front of the FBI Building." [...] The following year, Gerard Moeller and Christopher Weeks wrote in the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. that the FBI building was the [...] "swaggering bully of the neighborhood...ungainly, ill-mannered..." [...] They also blamed the structure's poor design for undermining the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue: [...] "the impenetrable base, the shadowy courtyard, and looming upper stories bespeak security and surveillance. The prototype for the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment plan devised under the direction of Nathanial Owings, it helped to ensure that the full plan would never be realized." [...] Five years later, in 2011, Washington City Paper reporter Lydia DePillis noted that the building has [...] "long been maligned as downtown D.C.'s ugliest edifice". Architecture for Dummies author Deborah K. Dietsch said in April 2012 that it was [...] "disastrous", [...] "insensitive", and [...] "hostile", and that it and the James V.
