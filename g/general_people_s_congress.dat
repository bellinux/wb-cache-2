40|$|China {{is joining}} {{the group of}} {{countries}} that have reasonably comprehensive systems of social protection in place. In 2010, the National <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>Congress</b> adopted the first national Social Insurance Law, representing {{the culmination of a}} process of radical social reform. The question this paper asks is: what kind of welfare regime is being built in the <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of China? China has been politically unique. It is one of only five remaining communist states, the others being Cuba, Laos, the Democratic <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of Korea and Vietnam, and the only one (with some qualification for Vietnam) that has been economically successful. The characteristics of a communist state include centralized {{power in the hands of}} a party 9 lite and that this 9 lite is presumably motivated, to varying degrees, by some kind of socialist ideology of statism and social justice. While maintaining its political uniqueness, China has shed its economic uniqueness. With the reform and opening up that started in 1978, it turned its back on planned economy isolationism and has adopted an open socialist market economy. In considering what kind of welfare state is emerging in China, the paper looks at two hypotheses: is China producing a welfare state of its own kind, possibly a "socialist" welfare state? Or, if it is reproducing a conventional welfare state, what kind of previous experience elsewhere is it replicating...|$|R
40|$|State high-risk {{insurance}} pools serve {{people who}} have been denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or who don’t have access to employer based coverage. There are 35 state high-risk insurance pools across the country serving approximately 200, 000 <b>people.</b> The U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress</b> is considering various proposals to expand high risk pool coverage as part of health care reform to cover people with pre-existing conditions. However, data suggest that high risk pools as currently proposed will not adequately meet the needs of those with potentially serious health conditions. Many risk pool enrollees fall into a gray area between being chronically ill, but able to work at least part-time, and being disabled to the point of qualifying for federal disability programs and their accompanying health care coverage. As Congress astutely noted in its 1999 Ticket to Work legislation, moving just one half of one percent of people off of disability programs and back into the workforce would result in $ 3. 5 billion in federal savings. Preventing one-half of one percent of people from being added to the disability rolls would result in an additional net savings of $ 3. 5 billion to the federal government. 1 Current High Risk Pool Costs and Coverage In 2008, lawmakers called for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the abilit...|$|R

The results provide a rationale for why lobby groups are more active n the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress.</b> The key institutional feature to explain the di. erent behavior of lobby groups is the vote of con. dence procedure,which creates voting cohesion in a parlia- mentary system across policy issues.

These impacts are often harmful, significant, and long-lasting. Despite this fact, these bills rarely receive adequate consideration regarding {{how they will}} impact trade. Without this consideration, Congress cannot properly conduct the benefit-cost analysis necessary to pass effective laws. Failure to consider a law’s unintended consequences almost guarantees poor outcomes. To remedy this problem, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress</b> committee structure could be amended so that laws that impact trade are considered appropriately. However, the domestic focus of Congressional politics leaves the Legislature in a poor position to enforce stable trade policy. Thus, a Presidential Executive Order requiring agencies to consider the trade implications of rules is ultimately necessary...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies of lawmaking activity by legislatures {{rely heavily on}} roll call based measures and assume that roll call activity reflects lawmaking activity. We question this assumption for {{the case of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress.</b> We examine several plausible sources of dissonance between the set of enacted public statutes and the universe of recorded votes in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress,</b> using a comprehensive dataset of public enactments and roll call activity between 1891 and 1994. Because only 11. 9 % of the bills signed into law receive a recorded vote in the House, only 7. 9 % receive a recorded vote in the Senate, and only 5. 5 % receive a recorded vote in both the House and Senate, we provide guidance as to when studying voting behavior is likely a reasonable proxy for lawmaking behavior. There are sometimes important differ-ences between the laws that do and do not receive a roll call that researchers should account for when using roll calls to study lawmaking in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Congress.</b> Unlike the study of public opinion, whose objects of interest can often be directly assessed, legislative politics research is typically interested in more elusive concepts.
