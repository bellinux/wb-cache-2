25|$|The AIM framework. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> study, {{researchers}} {{examined the}} role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents.

Specifically, the detection {{gap between the two}} groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.|$|E

The show was based on the BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, but somewhat less abrasive than the original. O'Connor's Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.|$|E

25|$|The National Trust has {{invested}} £600,000 in a marine source heat pump to provide heating for the house. At 300 kilowatts, the pump {{is the biggest}} in Britain.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pilot</b> program {{to develop a new}} way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement.

Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E
