This research emphasized on the development of the Spare Part Inventory Management System (SPIMS) for the Profound Heritage Sdn Bhd (PHSB), which is currently adopting the manual Kadex method. This automatic software used the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) in the periodic review environment to control the inventory and the software was written using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. Therefore, this research will not only helps the PHSB but also increased literature on the actual implementation of the EOQ technique in the periodic review environment. This newly developed SPIMS have the ability to keep the spare parts transaction records, calculate the EOQ for each part and remind the user to purchase more spare parts at its dedicated “When to Order ” date. The developed SPIMS performance was then evaluated by comparing it to the current Kadex or manual method. The method, which produced the lowest average inventories, is considered as the best method. Comparison across the overall average inventory indicated that the EOQ with zero <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> (which represented a system that start with zero opening inventories) performs better than the Kadex method.

40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from an analysis and {{comparison of the}} legal and accounting concepts related to the amendment of the Transformation of Business Companies and Cooperatives Act and Regulation 500, that the amended regulations are characterized by an extensive right to choose in terms of business regulation. While the legal and accounting regulations {{until the end of}} 2011 addressed transformations generally as purchasings, the commercial and accounting regulations from 1 st January 2012 provide solutions mainly for transformations of the restructuring type. The amendment offers a high degree of choice and thus provides space for both factual concepts, however, this fact is not specified in any of the appropriate regulations. The availability of all these possible variants, from the decisive date {{at the very beginning of}} the preparation and implementation of the transformation to the recognition of an entry of a transformation in the Register of Companies, as the record date, i. e., a combination of the decisive date and the effective date, leads to a complicated accounting view that is time-consuming, often confusing and, unfortunately, does not define the conditions for recognising a transformation with the substance of a purchase and a transformation with the substance of a restructuring. Highlighting the reflection based on individual accounting transactions for the participating companies, and especially in the unusual method included in the so-called <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet method, leads to a suppression of the information links between summary financial information from the financial statements on the entry into the transformation and the summarized financial information in the form of an <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet of the successor company...|$|R

40|$|Both {{the legal}} and {{accounting}} conceptual differences in national legislations regulating mergers may be quite significant {{in spite of the}} unification processes taking place via the transposition of EU directives into national law. Most often, we find differences in the following issues: If there is a re-measurement or no re-measurement during mergers, and where re-measurement is required, the manner of its reflection in the accounting records in accordance with national regulations, usually as a modification of a general accounting method used for a purchase; The date of acquisition (balance sheet date) versus the date of coming into force by means of an entry in the prescribed register; The existence or non-existence of a duty to prepare special purpose financial reports whose consolidation is used to determine values in the <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet of the legal successor of a merger of the businesses of the participating companies; The determination of an <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet by consolidating the special purpose financial reports or the participating companies, but 2 ̆ 013 technically 2 ̆ 013 by means of accounting entries by which the successor takes over the business of a liquidated company and its assets and liabilities, i. e. a de facto accounting procedure as used for booking the contribution of a business. From a formally legal point of view, these discrepancies represent obstacles in implementing crossborder mergers. If we do not take into consideration potentially inaccurate terminology arising from the translation of the EU directive regulating cross-border mergers, there is a solution based on the direction implied already in the 19802 ̆ 019 s by International Accounting Standards, i. e. to understand both domestic and cross-border mergers as business combinations and to build both commercial law and accounting law for this area on the common concept whose expression is a de facto general accounting method used for purchases...|$|R

The {{determination of the}} parameters in such regimes is challenging for national regulatory authorities (NRA), since there is normally a single TSO operating in each jurisdiction. The solution for European regulators {{has been found in}} international regulatory benchmarking, organized in collaboration with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) in 2008 and 2012 for 22 and 23 TSOs, respectively. The frontier study provides static cost efficiency estimates for each TSO, as well as dynamic results in terms of technological improvement rate and efficiency catch-up speed. In this paper, we provide the methodology for the benchmarking, using non-parametric DEA under weight restrictions, as well as an analysis of the static cost efficiency resutls for 2011. The overall cost efficiency is measured with a three-output model, explaining 91. 2 % of variance, using a DEA model under non-decreasing returns to scale assumptions.

A wide range of {{complementary}} research methods has been used in order to triangulate results, starting with classical beta and sigma convergence analysis, to kernel density estimation, transition matrices, spatial autocorrelation and multi-dimensional comparisons. Some rarely discussed aspects of the influence of capital regions on growth processes have been taken into account. An additional analysis of the data in relation to country averages produced results independent of the country context. As a result, we have been able to answer the following questions: do the analysed countries experience regional convergence or rather divergence/polarisation processes?
