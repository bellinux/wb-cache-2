It is [...] in diameter and has a height of [...] The two deep drawn steel hemispheres of the Hang are hardened by a process known as gas nitridization. The side considered the bottom has an opening (Gu) in the center which allows the generation of the bass note through Helmholtz resonance. When it is played in a damped way it can change in pitch similar to a talking drum. On the top are seven or eight notes arranged in a tone circle in zigzag fashion from low to high. All are tuned harmonically (with fundamental, octave and the <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>octave)</b> around a low note (Ding) {{at the center of the}} tone circle. Each creation is numbered and signed.|$|E

50|$|The perfect fifth may {{be derived}} from the {{harmonic}} series as the interval between {{the second and third}} harmonics. In a diatonic scale, the dominant note is a perfect <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tonic note.|$|R
50|$|The scale lacks {{a perfect}} fourth {{and a perfect}} <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} note. Both {{the fourth and fifth}} degrees of a scale form the basis of standard chord progressions, which help establish the tonic.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a chanter, a mouthblown blowpipe, and three drones. The lowest drone (bordó llarg) plays a note two <b>octaves</b> below <b>the</b> tonic of the chanter. The middle drone (bordó mitjà) plays a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> bass.

2500|$|For instance, {{the name}} C {{augmented}} seventh, {{and the corresponding}} symbol Caug7 (which can also be written as C+7) use parts 1 ("C", thus the chord has [...] "C" [...] as the root note), 2 (an augmented <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> root note), and 3 (with the seventh scale degree <b>above</b> <b>the</b> root note).|$|R
50|$|The {{tendency}} of the interval of the augmented sixth to resolve outwards is therefore {{explained by the fact}} that the A, being a dissonant note, a diminished <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> root (D), and flatted, must fall, whilst the F - being chromatically raised - must rise.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the bells}} have the foundry's name cast onto their waist. The nine smaller bells are also {{decorated}} with inscriptions, quotes from Psalms from the King James Version of the Bible, cast onto their waist, while the largest bell's inscription reads [...] "St. Andrews Church, Sydney NS". This largest bell weighs about 2050 lb and its pitch is E in <b>the</b> middle <b>octave.</b> <b>The</b> chime is attuned to concert pitch, to the eight notes of <b>the</b> <b>octave</b> or diatonic scale with two bells added, one bell a semitone, a flat seventh, and one bell, <b>the</b> treble bell, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>octave.</b> This smallest bell, at about 200 lb, rings an F.|$|R

50|$|The doina is a free-rhythm, highly ornamented (usually melismatic), {{improvisation}}al tune. The improvisation {{is done on}} {{a more or less}} fixed pattern (usually a descending one), by {{stretching the}} notes in a rubato-like manner, according to the performer's mood and imagination. Usually the prolonged notes are <b>the</b> fourth or <b>ﬁfth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> floor note.|$|R

The fourth harmonic vibrates at four times {{the frequency of the}} fundamental and sounds a perfect fourth <b>above</b> <b>the</b> third harmonic (two <b>octaves</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fundamental).

5000|$|The {{baritone}} {{singer is}} often the one required to support or [...] "fill" [...] the bass sound (typically by singing <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> bass root) and to complete a chord. On the other hand, the baritone will occasionally find himself harmonizing <b>above</b> <b>the</b> melody, which calls for a tenor-like quality.

5000|$|By {{overblowing}} a cylindrical closed tube, a note can {{be obtained}} that is approximately a twelfth <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fundamental note of the tube. This is sometimes described as one-fifth <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>octave</b> of <b>the</b> fundamental note. For example, if the fundamental note of a closed pipe is C1, then overblowing the pipe gives G2, which is one-twelfth above C1. Alternatively {{we can say that}} G2 is one-fifth <b>above</b> C2 — <b>the</b> <b>octave</b> <b>above</b> C1. Adjusting <b>the</b> taper of this cylinder for a decreasing cone can tune the second harmonic or overblown note close to <b>the</b> <b>octave</b> position or 8th. (ref: Horns,Strings and Harmony, by Arthur H. Benade.) Opening a small [...] "speaker hole" [...] at the Phi point, or shared [...] "wave/node" [...] position will cancel the fundamental frequency and force the tube to resonate at a 12th <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fundamental. This technique is used in a Recorder by pinching open the dorsal thumb hole. Moving this small hole upwards, closer to the voicing will make it an [...] "Echo Hole" [...] (Dolmetsch Recorder Modification) that will give a precise half note <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fundamental when opened. Note: Slight size or diameter adjustment is needed to zero in on the precise half note frequency.|$|R
50|$|The treble flute is {{a member}} of the flute family. It is in the key of G, pitched a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> concert flute and is a {{transposing}} instrument, sounding a fifth up from the written note. The instrument is rare today, only occasionally found in flute choirs, some marching bands or private collections. Some 19th-century operas, such as Ivanhoe include the instrument in their orchestrations.|$|R
5000|$|Shackleton writes, [...] "In particular, {{it is easy}} to {{perceive}} that the pre-Boehm clarinet, with rather small tone holes spaced about 2 cm apart, should have very different characteristics from the Boehm instrument carrying tone holes every centimeter or so." [...] The tone of individual notes and the intonation of the scale depend on the precise relationship between the resonances. For example, if the second prominent resonance is not exactly an <b>octave</b> plus a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> fundamental, the resonance will not be properly built and will therefore result in a less vibrant tone.|$|R

5000|$|... "Zip Coon" [...] has a vocal {{range of}} an octave and a minor sixth. Both the verse and the chorus end on the tonic, and both begin a major third <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tonic. In the verse, the highest note is a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> tonic {{and the lowest}} is a minor sixth below. In the chorus, the highest note is an <b>octave</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> last note, and the lowest is the last note itself. The song stays in key throughout.|$|R
50|$|A well-set-up {{instrument}} {{from the}} violin family will have {{attention paid to}} the tuning of the afterlength, or string length on the tailpiece side of the bridge. On many instruments it is set to 1/6 the playing length, or length between nut and bridge, sounding two <b>octaves</b> and a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> open note of the playing length. This tuning may be varied to give certain desired effects.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the end of}} the 9th century, singers in monasteries such as St. Gall in Switzerland began {{experimenting with}} adding another part to the chant, {{generally}} a voice in parallel motion, singing mostly in perfect fourths or <b>fifths</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> original tune (see interval). This development is called organum and represents the beginnings of counterpoint and, ultimately, harmony. Over the next several centuries, organum developed in several ways.|$|R
5000|$|Heinrich Glarean {{considered}} that the modal scales including a B {{had to be}} the result of a transposition. In his Dodecachordon he not only described six [...] "natural" [...] diatonic scales (still neglecting the seventh one with a diminished <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> reference note), but also six [...] "transposed" [...] ones, each including a B, resulting in the total of twelve scales that justified the title of his treatise.|$|R
25|$|In the {{illustration}} the bass note is a C, {{and the numbers}} 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above, that is F and A, should be played, giving the second inversion of the F major triad. If no numbers are written beneath a bass note, this is assumed to indicate the figure 5,3, which calls for a third and a <b>fifth</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> bass note (i.e., a root position triad).|$|R
