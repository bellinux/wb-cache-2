50|$|Drill jigs started {{falling into}} disuse with the {{invention}} of the <b>jig</b> <b>borer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jig borers {{are limited}} to working {{materials}} that are still soft enough to be bored. Often a jig is hardened; for a <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> this requires the material to be bored first and then hardened, which may introduce distortion. The jig grinder was developed as a machine with the precision of the <b>jig</b> <b>borer,</b> but capable of working materials in their hardened state.|$|E
5000|$|Before the <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> was developed, hole center {{location}} {{had been}} accomplished either with layout (either quickly-but-imprecisely or painstakingly-and-precisely) or with drill jigs (themselves made with painstaking-and-precise layout). The <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> was invented to expedite {{the making of}} drill jigs, but it helped to {{eliminate the need for}} drill jigs entirely by making quick precision directly available for the parts that the jigs would have been created for. The revolutionary underlying principle was that advances in machine tool control that expedited the making of jigs were fundamentally a way to expedite the cutting process itself, for which the jig was just a means to an end. Thus the jig borer's development helped advance machine tool technology toward later NC and CNC development. The <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> was a logical extension of manual machine tool technology that began to incorporate some then-novel concepts that would become routine with NC and CNC control, such as: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{boring process}} can be {{executed}} on various machine tools, including (1) general-purpose or universal machines, such as lathes (/turning centers) or milling machines (/machining centers), and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function, such as <b>jig</b> <b>borers</b> and boring machines or boring mills, which include vertical boring mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical axis while boring bar/head moves linearly; essentially a vertical lathe) and horizontal boring mills (workpiece sits on a table while the boring bar rotates around a horizontal axis; essentially a specialized horizontal milling machine).|$|R
50|$|Moore's {{father had}} founded the Moore Special Tool Company, of Bridgeport, a tool and die maker. This {{specialised}} in ultra high-precision machine tools, such as <b>jig</b> <b>borers</b> and <b>jig</b> grinders. Wayne {{went to work}} for this company in 1953 and in time became its president. In 1970 he authored the book, Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy which is now seen as a standard text for the design of precise and stable machinery. He also became chairman of the National Machine Tool Builders Association (NMTB), the Acme United Corporation, and was a director of the American Precision Museum and the Bridgeport Engineering Institute.|$|R
50|$|The {{technological}} advances {{that led to}} the <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> and NC were about to usher in the age of CNC and CAD/CAM, radically changing the way people manufacture many of their goods.|$|E
50|$|Several {{innovations}} {{in the development}} of the <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> were the work of the Moore Special Tool Company. In particular, the adoption of hardened and accurate leadscrews, formed by grinding, rather than a soft leadscrew with a compensating nut.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> {{is a type}} {{of machine}} tool invented at the end of World War I to make {{possible}} the quick-yet-very-precise location of hole centers. It was invented independently in Switzerland and the United States. It resembles a specialized species of milling machine that provides tool and die makers with a higher degree of positioning precision (repeatability) and accuracy than those general machines had provided. Although capable of light milling, a <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> is more suited to highly accurate drilling, boring, and reaming, where the quill or headstock does not see the significant side loading as it would with mill work. The result is a machine designed more for location accuracy than heavy material removal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jig</b> <b>borer</b> Vertical mills {{that are}} built to bore holes, and very light slot or face milling. They are {{typically}} bed mills {{with a long}} spindle throw. The beds are more accurate, and the handwheels are graduated down to [...]0001" [...] for precise hole placement.|$|E
5000|$|... "In many cases, a <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> is a 'jig eliminator.' In other words, such {{a machine}} {{may be used}} instead of a jig either when the {{quantity}} of work is not large enough to warrant making a jig or when there is insufficient time for jig making." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{his death}} in 2011, George Daniels bequeathed his entire {{workshop}} to Smith, and he noted [...] "George’s whole studio was geared towards the singular goal of one man being able to design and make a watch from start to finish”. Incorporated within the studio are Daniels’ Schaublin Lathes and Hauser <b>Jig</b> <b>Borer,</b> used to make vital high-precision parts for the watches, which combine with the hand engine-turning equipment, {{dating back to the}} 1820s.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, Wayne R. Moore {{wrote about}} the Moore family firm, the Moore Special Tool Company, who {{independently}} invented the <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> (contemporaneously with its Swiss invention). Moore's monograph, Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy, [...] is a seminal classic {{of the principles of}} machine tool design and construction that yield the highest possible accuracy and precision in machine tools (second only to that of metrological machines). The Moore firm epitomized the art and science of the tool and die maker.|$|E
50|$|The {{jig grinder}} {{is very similar}} to a <b>jig</b> <b>borer,</b> in that the table {{positioning}} and spindles are very accurate (far more so than a manual milling machine or lathe). It is almost exclusively used by tool and die makers in the creation of jigs or mating holes and pegs on dies. There are usually many peripheral elements to a large jig grinder, including separate hydraulic motors, air compressors, and various cooling systems for both the hydraulic circuit and supplying coolant to the work and machine itself.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> has a {{work table}} of around 400 x 200 mm, (15.748 x 7.87402 inch) {{which can be}} moved using large {{handwheels}} (with micrometer-style readouts and verniers) on particularly carefully made shafts with a strong degree of gearing; this allowed positions to be set on the two axes to an accuracy of 0.0001 inch (2.5 micron). It was generally used to enlarge to a precise size smaller holes drilled with less accurate machinery in approximately the correct place (i.e., with the small hole strictly within the area to be bored out for the large hole).|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the end of}} World War I, {{machine tool}} control {{advanced}} in various ways that {{laid the groundwork for}} later CNC technology. The <b>jig</b> <b>borer</b> popularized the ideas of coordinate dimensioning (dimensioning of all locations on the part from a single reference point); working routinely in [...] "tenths" [...] (ten-thousandths of an inch, 0.0001") as an everyday machine capability; and using the control to go straight from drawing to part, circumventing jig-making. In 1920 the new tracer design of J.C. Shaw was applied to Keller tracer milling machines for die-sinking via the three-dimensional copying of a template. This made diesinking faster and easier just as dies were in higher demand than ever before, and was very helpful for large steel dies such as those used to stamp sheets in automobile manufacturing. Such machines translated the tracer movements to input for servos that worked the machine leadscrews or hydraulics. They also spurred the development of antibacklash leadscrew nuts. All of the above concepts were new in the 1920s but became routine in the NC/CNC era. By the 1930s, incredibly large and advanced milling machines existed, such as the Cincinnati Hydro-Tel, that presaged today's CNC mills in every respect except for CNC control itself.|$|E
