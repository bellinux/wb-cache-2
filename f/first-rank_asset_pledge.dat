40|$|This study {{analyses}} empirically what patent characteristics {{matter for}} collateralization. In {{accordance with the}} finance literature, loan collateral {{is determined by the}} liquidation value of the asset which in turn depends on the three factors "physical attributes of the asset", "number of alternative users" and "financial strength of alternative users". Hence, the study is focusing on patent characteristics influencing the three factors of the liquidation value. To control for firm effects of the patent pledging firms, a treatment group of pledged patents and a comparison group of unpledged patents have been matched based on firm characteristics of the patent owner. The subsequent empirical analysis revealed that patent characteristics related to the physical attributes of patents enhancing their redeployability matter for collateralization. Patent characteristics related to the market liquidity measuring the financial strength of alternative users, are insignificant. Furthermore, the study confirms the additional function of patents as source of finance by offering them for loan collateral.

50|$|Subordinated debt {{refers to}} a class of {{obligations}} that are contractually subordinated in ranking {{to all of the}} senior obligations (i.e., general non-subordinated obligations) of the company, whether they are secured or unsecured. Although the second lien loan's security interest is subordinated to the first lien loan's interest in the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> of the company, the ranking of first lien and second lien loans are the same in the event the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> are not sufficient to satisfy the outstanding borrowings.

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} bank {{seniority}} {{is now a}} widely accepted fact in the academic literature. At the same time, trade creditors are sometimes granted a purchase money security interest in the materials or equipment they provide the firm. These two conflicting facts present a puzzle: Why would banks willingly give up a valuable priority claim on the firm, but only {{with respect to a}} subset of the firm’s assets? We propose a resolution to this paradox of priority by arguing that trade creditors are better able to liquidate the materials they supply to a firm. When trade creditors have a security interest in these assets, their claims are state-contingent, and therefore dependent on the value of the <b>assets</b> <b>pledged</b> as collateral. Surprisingly, this ability of trade creditors to more efficiently liquidate the materials they supply to a firm also makes it desirable to subordinate the non-collateralized portion of their claims. Doing so increases the face value of a trade creditor’s claim for a given level of borrowing, thereby increasing the “liquidation bang ” from each trade credit buck. This combined priority structure maximizes social welfare by reducing the firm’s overall cost of funding. Banks are generally the most senior creditor among lenders to small business borrowers. Mann (1997) and Schwartz (1997) present evidence that banks not only take senior claims over other creditors, but also collateralize as much of their debt as possible and use loan covenants to limit th...|$|R

How is this puzzle solved? We find for a representative sample from Northeast Thailand that indeed most loans do not include any tangible assets as collateral. Instead, lenders enforce collateral-free loans through third-party guarantees and relationship lending, but also through modifying loan terms, such as reducing loan size. Guarantees are the relatively most important substitute, they reduce collateral requirements independently of relationship lending and they are more often used by formal financial institutions. lending, financial institutions, collateral, guarantees, relationship lending...|$|R

40|$|The West Liberty Foods turkey {{cooperative}} {{was formed}} in 1996 to purchase the assets and assume operations of Louis Rich Foods (an investor-owned processing firm), which, at the time, announced the imminent shutdown of its West Liberty, Iowa, processing facility. We study the creation and performance of this "new generation" cooperative using field interviews with grower members and company management. We describe changes, {{before and after the}} buyout, in the contractual apparatus used for procuring live turkeys, and in the communication requirements, work expectations, and financial positions of growers. During the private ownership period, most of the inputs (except labor and facilities) were provided by the firm; there was substantial supervision of the growers' actions; growers faced little price and production risk; and growers' equity was due largely to ownership of land and other farm assets. Our interviews reveal that, after cooperative formation, growers were exposed to considerable additional risk; monitoring of growers by the firm was less intensive; grower time and effort commitments to turkey production increased substantially; and a significant fraction of firm (cooperative) equity came from growers' willingness to leverage their farm and personal assets (and hence indirectly their existing relationships with local lenders). We argue that some of these changes are consistent with a financial contract where <b>asset</b> <b>pledging</b> and its corollary risk generate higher work effort by growers and a reduction in agency rents. These economies likely compensate for an organizational deadweight loss traditionally associated with cooperative governance. Cooperatives, procurement, financial contracting, agriculture. ...|$|R

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TECHNICAL EXPERT GROUP ISSUES PAPER (RESTEG) # 1 CLARIFICATION OF PLEDGED ASSETS 1.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{theoretical}} and empirical study {{of the relation between}} financial development {{and the size of the}} underground economy. In our theoretical framework agents allocate investment between a low-return technology which can be operated with internal funds, and a high-return technology which requires external finance. Firms can reduce the cost of funding by disclosing part or all of their <b>assets</b> and <b>pledging</b> them as collateral. The disclosure decision, however, also involves higher tax payments and reduces tax evasion. We show that financial development (a reduction in the cost of external finance) can reduce tax evasion and the size of the underground economy. We test the main implications of the model using Italian microeconomic data that allow us to construct a micro-based index of the underground economy. In line with the model’s predictions, we find that local financial development is associated with a smaller size of the underground economy, controlling for the potential endogeneity of financial development and other determinants of the underground economy.
