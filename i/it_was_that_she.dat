500|$|Kelly {{received}} word {{that his wife}} had been shot from an aide of the Congresswoman almost immediately after the shooting. He flew from Houston to Tucson with members of his family. While en route, the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died. [...] "The kids, Claudia and Claire, started crying. My mother, she almost screamed. I just walked into the bathroom, and, you know, broke down." [...] Calling family in Tucson, Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery. [...] "It was a terrible mistake," [...] Kelly said, [...] "as bad as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had died, it's equally exciting that she hadn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|And why, Gasparoli asked, {{does the}} caller seem {{reluctant}} to touch Hedgepeth's body despite repeated pleas from the dispatcher {{to at least}} see if she is still breathing? If Rosario {{was not able to}} bring herself to do so, could she not have asked Rangel to do so? [...] "I have often thought," [...] Gaparoli wrote," [...] if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> , <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't call 9-1-1 the moment she first saw [...]" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Lady Milborough {{could not}} clearly bring to her mind what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had to remember.|$|E
6000|$|... "It does count, mother. I suppose Ayala is {{the same}} as other girls in <b>that</b> respect. I <b>am</b> sure I don't know why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should have taken such an aversion to me. I suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doesn't think me so much,--quite such a swell as some other men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Rawlinson, who {{had only}} a second-class ticket, insists upon being told how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> {{transferred}} to the saloon." ...|$|R
6000|$|He falters on the threshold, [...] She lingers on the stair: [...] Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> his footstep? [...] Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> there? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{knew then}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had been hoping}} for. She looked down at him and smiled.|$|E
60|$|Rose {{looked at}} him, and thought how strange <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{did not like}} him any better, now when she ought to.|$|E
60|$|And thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{gathered}} {{him into}} her embrace, while the great strong man, only then fully realizing all the changes, sobbed uncontrollably beside her.|$|E
6000|$|Kate so possessed her facts, as <b>it</b> <b>were,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{smiled at}} his violence. [...] "You'll {{extraordinarily}} like her. She's exquisite. And there are reasons. I mean others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The deeper it goes, child,' {{said the}} elder Chevalier, 'the better <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should <b>be</b> undeceived {{as soon as}} possible. She will recover, and be {{amenable}} the sooner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He laughed uneasily. [...] "I don't {{know how}} I came {{to think of}} it--unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wears the same dress every day. Very neat; but (perhaps I'm wrong) a little shabby too." ...|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the terror}} in her eyes, {{and he spoke}} quickly. All the time he found himself {{wondering}} how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was guessing at the truth.|$|E
60|$|The change {{back was}} more marked in Margaret {{than in any}} of us. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a woman, whilst we were men; perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was younger than the rest; perhaps both reasons were effective, each in its own way. At any rate the change was there, and I was happier than I had been through the long journey. All her buoyancy, her tenderness, her deep feeling seemed to shine forth once more; now and again as her father's eyes rested on her, his face seemed to light up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{silent and}} broken, poor thing. She {{is to see}} your mother to- morrow. How well <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> kept me so late over her wreath of camellias!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, poor Lucilla!" [...] I said. [...] "What a {{much happier}} {{prospect}} hers might have been! What a thousand pities <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{not going to}} marry your brother, instead of marrying you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Jude {{wondered}} if she had really left her handkerchief behind; or whether <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had miserably wished to tell him of a love that at the last moment she could not bring herself to express.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{might keep}} a journal: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wrote and received letters. If {{he could only}} find her desk unlocked and her drawers open, the inmost secrets of her life would be at his mercy.|$|R
60|$|I {{expressed}} {{as much of}} my astonishment as was then capable of expression, {{and asked if he}} could guess what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had taken so much amiss, so suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "We didn't hardly say a {{word about}} you," [...] said her mother, and now she saw what a good thing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had staid and talked impersonalities with Mrs. Burton.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{lost her}} temper and cuffed his ears so soundly as {{to drive him}} back among his fellows. But they did not break up. Another boy stepped forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh?" [...] He ground a heel {{into the}} carpet--a thing I've often read about, {{but had never}} seen done before. [...] "Then perhaps you will explain how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> happens to come to be engaged to him?" ...|$|R
50|$|On April 18, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> Yajima Maimi, Suzuki Airi, and Okai Chisato will {{star in a}} {{new stage}} play, Theatre In The Round. On November 30, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> announced <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> joining the M-Line fanclub in March 2013.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo", <b>it</b> <b>is</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{will have}} three {{children}} in the future: Xavier, Fred and Amanda.In [...] "Great Balls of Water" [...] <b>it</b> <b>is</b> revealed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> plays 20 different instruments that start with [...] "B".|$|R
6000|$|... "By Saint Giles," [...] {{said the}} page, [...] "I wonder not at her passion, but only marvel by what {{forgetfulness}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could urge the Lady Fleming {{with such a}} question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My spies {{are good}} and quick. Did you get my message sent by the King's men? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> who stood {{with you on the}} rock in the river, greeted you and awaited you?" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{one knew}} whether Miss Charlecote {{were still in}} town, nor whether Augusta Fulmort were to be married in England or abroad; and as to Miss Murrell, Lolly languidly {{wondered}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is over--that!" [...] he said. [...] "I {{am a man}} {{who knows}} when he has been ill-treated; who knows, too, what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a wife owes to her husband. Tell me where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> lives, old man. Write it down." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{this day}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an {{unsettled}} question {{whether this was}} done on purpose by Kathy. Certain <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not tumble, but burst into a hearty fit of laughter, while her large lustrous eyes half shut themselves up and twinkled.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> {{joining the}} Pixies for their European tour that year, following {{the departure of}} original member Kim Deal; however, in late November of <b>that</b> same year, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> announced <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no longer playing with the Pixies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Away, fool!" [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "send me that hag hither; she shall avouch what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hath {{given to the}} wretch Dryfesdale, or the pilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench {{it out of her}} finger joints!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{went into}} the house knowing that she must at once seek her mother but she allowed herself first to remain for some half--hour in her own bedroom, {{preparing}} the words that she would use. The interview she knew would be difficult--much more difficult {{than it would have been}} before her last walk with Mr. Saul; and the worst of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not quite make up her mind as to what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished to say. She waited till she could hear her mother's step on the stairs. At last Mrs. Clavering came up to dress, and then Fanny, following her quickly into her bedroom, abruptly began: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{asked how}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had no {{companion}} {{to take care}} of her. [...] "You are too young and too pretty," [...] I said in my blunt English way, [...] "to trust yourself alone in such a place as this." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jane {{commenced}} {{to wonder}} what his plans were. Would he take {{her back to the}} beach or would he keep her here? Suddenly <b>she</b> realized <b>that</b> the matter did not seem to give her much concern. Could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not care! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} that ironically, you shouldn't say it now. If he dies, she will be well off, of course, and people will in time forget what has been said--that is, if she will live quietly. The worst of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> fears nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They did. That's {{the whole}} bally trouble. Jeeves, I'm {{sorry to say}} that fiancée of yours--Miss Watson, you know--the cook, you know--well, the long and the short of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> chosen riches instead of honest worth, {{if you know what}} I mean." ...|$|R
