2500|$|Flame or <b>induction</b> <b>hardening</b> are {{processes}} {{in which the}} surface of the steel is heated very rapidly to high temperatures (by direct application of an oxy-gas flame, or by induction heating) then cooled rapidly, generally using water; this creates a [...] "case" [...] of martensite on the surface.

50|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>hardening</b> {{is a form}} of heat {{treatment}} in which a metal part is heated by induction heating and then quenched. The quenched metal undergoes a martensitic transformation, increasing the hardness and brittleness of the part. <b>Induction</b> <b>hardening</b> is used to selectively harden areas of a part or assembly without affecting the properties of the part as a whole.|$|E
50|$|<b>Induction</b> surface <b>hardened</b> low alloyed medium {{carbon steels}} {{are widely used}} for {{critical}} automotive and machine applications which require high wear resistance.

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the subsurface residual stress and hardness distributions is required for failure analysis, fatigue life prediction and process control of <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> components. X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides {{a powerful tool for}} the simultaneous determination of both the macroscopic residual stress and hardness distributions through the case and into the core of <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> parts. A procedure for developing the empirical relationship between diffraction peak width and mechanical hardness is described. Subsurface XRD residual stress measurement requires layer removal and correction for the resulting stress relaxation. The corrections may dominate the results obtained at depths near the case/core interface. Traditional closed-form corrections may be inadequate when applied to gear teeth. A novel finite element analysis (FEA) correction technique applicable to arbitrary geometries and stress distributions is presented and described.

On stud style {{followers}} one of the end plates is integrated into the inner race/stud; the other is pressed onto the stud up to a shoulder on the inner race. The inner race is <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> so that the stud remains soft if modifications need to be made. On yoke style followers the end plates are peened or pressed onto the inner race or liquid metal injected onto the inner race. The inner race is either <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> or through hardened.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Induction</b> <b>{{hardening}}</b> is {{a surface}} hardening technique which uses induction coils {{to provide a}} very rapid means of heating the metal. With induction heating, the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface, before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal. The surface is then quenched, hardening it, and is often used without further tempering. This makes the surface very resistant to wear, but provides tougher metal directly underneath it, leaving {{the majority of the}} object unchanged. A common use for <b>induction</b> <b>hardening</b> is for hardening the bearing surfaces, or [...] "journals", on automotive crankshafts or the rods of hydraulic cylinders.|$|E

For determination of the equivalent subsurface stress distribution field in the raceway, 3 D numerical model of the contact between the through hardened roller made of 100 Cr 6 steel and the surface hardened raceway made of 42 CrMo 4 was employed. The calculation of the contact fatigue life of the raceway was then carried out in the stress-life regime.

50|$|Modern {{versions}} of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised, {{such as an}} oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating. With flame hardening and <b>induction</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques, the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched.

Accordingly, pin on disc wear tests were conducted using carburised 8617 H pins and through hardened 4140 pins. The surface hardness of the pins was approximately 60 HRC for both materials. The discs were made of SAEAISI grade 1040 steel through hardened to a hardness of 45 HRC. The results showed that both the pins and the discs wore more rapidly when the tests were carried out with 4140 pins.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a recent study aimed at {{developing}} the stress-induced magnetic anisotropy (SMA) technique for characterizing residual stresses in case hardened steel components. The results of SMA measurements performed on flat <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> steel discs with different case depths confirm the feasibility of detecting principal stress axes by measuring the angular variation of magnetic permeability. The permeability signals along the principal axes were found to vary monotonically with the residual stresses measured by XRD, but the signals are in general smaller for samples with a larger case depth. The magnetomechanical properties of the martensitic case and ferritic/pearlitic core of the <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> sample were studied by measuring magnetostriction curves from strip samples that were cut from the case and core regions, respectively.

Coatings were deposited onto the <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> carbon steel and carburized hardened steel materials.

5000|$|Boriding, {{also called}} boronizing, {{is the process}} by which boron is {{introduced}} to a metal or alloy. It is a type of surface hardening. In this process boron atoms are diffused into the surface of a metal component. The resulting surface contains metal borides, such as iron borides, nickel borides, and cobalt borides, As pure materials, these borides have extremely high hardness and wear resistance. Their favorable properties are manifested even when they are {{a small fraction of the}} bulk solid. [...] Boronized metal parts are extremely wear resistant and will often last two to five times longer than components treated with conventional heat treatments such as hardening, carburizing, nitriding, nitrocarburizing or <b>induction</b> <b>hardening.</b> Most borided steel surfaces will have iron boride layer hardnesses ranging from 1200-1600 HV. Nickel-based superalloys such as Inconel and Hastalloys will typically have nickel boride layer hardnesses of 1700-2300 HV.|$|E
50|$|Galling occurs {{initially}} {{with material}} transfer from individual grains, on a microscopic scale, which become stuck or even diffusion welded to the adjacent surface. This transfer {{can be enhanced}} if one or both metals form {{a thin layer of}} hard oxides with high coefficients of friction, such as those found on aluminum or stainless-steel. As the lump grows it pushes against the adjacent material and begins forcing them apart, concentrating a majority of the friction heat-energy into a very small area. This in turn causes more adhesion and material build-up. The localized heat increases the plasticity of the galled surface, deforming the metal, until the lump breaks through the surface and begins plowing up large amounts of material from the galled surface. Methods of preventing galling include the use of lubricants like grease and oil, low-friction coatings and thin-film deposits like molybdenum disulfide or titanium nitride, and increasing the surface hardness of the metals using processes such as case hardening and <b>induction</b> <b>hardening.</b>|$|E

Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller.

For the mating surface roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of <b>induction</b> <b>hardened</b> steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm.
