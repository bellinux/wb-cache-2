5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts {{himself from}} his romantic {{problems}} by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors (Bawa and Ramsaywack). Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is offended when she learns that her employees hang out outside of work but do not invite <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> episode of 30 Rock closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|Mike was in {{character}} the entire time. He and Madonna {{really had a}} great chemistry together. This video shows her absolutely hysterical sense of humour, and it's great {{for everyone to see}} that side of <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> was by far the most fun I've ever had making a video.|$|E
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} <b>her</b> <b>this</b> story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world. I used to always say, 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up for me {{to work with her}} again this time.|$|E

5|$|After WrestleMania, Massaro {{continued}} as a valet for WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In storyline, on the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Massaro {{was attacked by}} Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a screw in her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> return was short lived when on the June 8 edition of SmackDown!, Massaro was suspended indefinitely after accidentally spilling Mr. McMahon's coffee on him. In reality, Massaro was taking time off to participate on the show Survivor.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong is {{considered}} to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. The eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game's de facto villain. The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. The ape kidnaps Mario's girlfriend, originally known as Lady, but later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that would provide the template for countless video games to come.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E

5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Graves and Elizabeth {{moved to}} work at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico {{when it opened in}} 1943. He made it a {{condition}} of his going to Los Alamos that a job be found there for <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> was probably unnecessary, as someone with her skills—she {{was one of the few}} physicists who had experience with a Cockcroft-Walton accelerator—would have been quickly snapped up at Los Alamos. At the time of the Trinity nuclear test in 1945, Elizabeth was seven months pregnant with her first child. Graves therefore requested that they be assigned to a post far from the blast. They listened to Samuel K. Allison's countdown to the explosion on the radio, and monitored the radioactive fallout from the test, which took until the afternoon to reach them, with Geiger counters. The child was a healthy daughter, Marilyn Edith.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a {{young girl}} nicknamed Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) has plans for a summer {{vacation}} with her father (Saho Sasazawa) {{who had been in}} Italy scoring film music. Her father returns home and surprises Gorgeous by announcing she has a new stepmother, Ryoko Ema (Haruko Wanibuchi). This upsets Gorgeous as her mother had died years earlier. Gorgeous goes to her bedroom and writes a letter to her aunt asking if she could come visit <b>her</b> <b>this</b> summer instead. Gorgeous' aunt replies and allows her to come visit. Gorgeous invites her six friends, Prof (Ai Matsubara), Melody (Eriko Tanaka), Kung Fu (Miki Jinbo), Mac (Mieko Sato), Sweet (Masayo Miyako) and Fantasy (Kumiko Oba) to come along with her. On arriving at the aunt's house, the girls are greeted by Gorgeous' aunt (Yōko Minamida) to whom they present a watermelon.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} in the third episode that Suzanne Warren (played by Uzo Aduba) is also involved in the fight {{at the end of}} season one. She punches Chapman in the face twice and knocks her unconscious (Doggett is already unconscious at this stage). This gives the impression that Doggett and Chapman were evenly matched and therefore equally responsible. Following Doggett's return to full health, she finds that her previous best friends, Leanne Taylor (played by Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (played by Julie Lake), no longer want to be associated with <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> leaves Doggett seeking prison counsellor Sam Healy (played by Michael J. Harney) for comfort.|$|E
5|$|Jacqui, {{along with}} Rhys then {{gets a new}} job at Chez Chez, a new bar that is owned by Cheryl and her brother Brendan Brady (Emmett J Scanlan). Jacqui and Rhys unknowingly meet on an {{internet}} dating website and fall for each other. Horrified when they find out, they kiss. Jacqui's cousin Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) moves into the McQueen household and causes a rift when he steals money from <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> causes Jacqui {{to move in with}} Rhys. Jacqui meets gangster Danny and they begin dating despite her feelings for Rhys. She cheats on Danny with Rhys, leaving Danny furious. Jacqui tells Rhys they need to keep their affair secret. However she ends their relationship as Jacqui catches Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) and Rhys having sex. Revengefully, Jacqui gets intoxicated and beds Gilly. She later tells Rhys that Gilly has sexually assaulted her, reports him to the police and he is charged.|$|E
5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to <b>her</b> <b>this</b> was not intentional and happened while she {{was in the process of}} developing the album.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in estrus and five males following <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{reached the age of}} 21, the prince became {{infatuated}} with Maria Fitzherbert. She was a commoner, six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic. Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which would never have been granted.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} Tirpitz {{several times}} during 1942 and 1943. When the battleship sortied to intercept Convoy PQ 12 on 6 March 1942 , which formed part of the convoy's escort, attempted to attack her using torpedo bombers. These aircraft launched twenty torpedoes at the battleship but all missed. On several occasions during 1942 and 1943 bombers from the Royal Air Force and Soviet Air Forces attempted to strike Tirpitz in her anchorages without success. On 23 September 1943 two British X-class midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship at her main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during Operation Source, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath <b>her.</b> <b>This</b> attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, putting her out of service for six months.|$|E
