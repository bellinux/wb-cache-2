5|$|The Ministries of Japan (行政機関) {{consist of}} eleven {{ministries}} and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry {{is headed by}} a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from {{among the members of}} the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve {{for more than a year}} or so necessary to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of the {{captured}} Lich {{as he is}} transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero {{that he thought he}} would be.|$|E
5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During {{the mission to}} Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, a SOLDIER 1st Class, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud took up Zack's sword, catching Sephiroth off guard and stabbing him. Zack urges Cloud to kill Sephiroth after Sephiroth emerges alive, but when Cloud pursues him, he is run through by Sephiroth's sword. Cloud, to Sephiroth's shock, summons the strength to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of the blade and lift Sephiroth off the ground, tossing him into a Mako vat below. Cloud and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with Cloud, bringing him {{to the outskirts of}} Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, in addition to the shame stemming from his personal failures, Cloud's mind fabricated a story blending together his own memories with accounts of Zack's heroics, creating a false personality. After piecing back together his identity, Cloud resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's mind a final time, but he is defeated in a one-on-one fight.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron were on {{a training}} flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E

25|$|The cars as {{delivered}} featured rattan {{seats and}} incandescent lighting, staples of most pre-WWII subway cars in New York City. All {{areas of the}} cars were lit, as bulbs were placed along the center roofline and {{down the sides of}} each car's interior. Additionally, pairs of bulbs on each end lit each end vestibule. As delivered, they did not come with fans, however windows and clerestory vents along the upper roof could be opened for ventilation. All windows were drop sash type (rather than rising sash type) for improved safety and {{to reduce the amount of}} draught in moving cars. Floors were made of wood (maple), and <b>grab</b> <b>holds</b> were provided along the roof for standees. Originally, these <b>grab</b> <b>holds</b> were made of leather (as on elevated trains), and later replaced with the steel <b>grab</b> <b>holds</b> that were IRT standard for many years.|$|R

25|$|A {{close-cropped}} {{or completely}} shaven haircut {{is common in}} military organizations. In field environments, soldiers are susceptible to infestation of lice, ticks, and fleas. In addition short hair is also more difficult for an enemy to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of in hand-to-hand combat, and short hair makes fitting gas masks and helmets easier.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the plot}} and central {{characters}} mostly remain unchanged, many gameplay elements {{from the original}} have been tweaked for the DualShock 4 controller. For instance, touch-based elements in the original game have been re-mapped and modified for use on PlayStation 4. The creation aspects, where players used the touchscreen to draw objects that would appear in game, are now used on the DualShock's touchpad. Alternatively, the player may use the PlayStation Camera or the PlayStation App to input their drawings. The latter options {{can also be used}} to input a real world texture or colour into the game, a feature previously dedicated to the Vita's rear camera. Along with new creation methods, the touchpad is used for interacting with the world. Certain platforms require the player to <b>grab,</b> <b>hold,</b> or drag them off the environment for use. The player can also use the touchpad to create a blast of wind, which can swipe enemies away and blow down extra platforms for use.|$|E

25|$|Players {{return to}} the map screen if they all run out of lives, or if all players lose their lives at the same time, leaving no one to free them. For most levels, there is a midway flag that if touched will return the player to that point after dying and being {{sent back to the}} map screen. Stages are {{completed}} by getting at least one player to touch the goal at the end, though a bonus is awarded if all players manage to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. In a few levels, in addition to the normal goal and flag pole, there are alternative exits leading to a flag pole with a red flag. Reaching this goal will open up a new path on the map, leading to new stages on the overworld map and, in some worlds, a warp cannon (which will blast the player off to a later world).|$|E
25|$|Some time in 1963, the United States {{government}} {{manages to}} <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> {{of several of}} Group 935's inventions, keeping them hidden in the Pentagon. Due {{to the presence of}} the undead-raising Element 115, zombies breach the Pentagon. John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro are trapped within the Pentagon, forced to fight their way out. Meanwhile, Richtofen's crew arrive at a Soviet Cosmodrome site, where Richtofen intends to travel to Group 935's moon base, Griffin Station. The crew is contacted by Gersh, a member of the Ascension Group who requests to be freed from Samantha's grip. After freeing Gersh, the four of them are teleported further in time, and arrive at a Siberian lighthouse sometime in 2011, once used by Richtofen as a secret lab. However, they are trapped within a locked room, and forced to rely on four movie actors: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Danny Trejo, Robert Englund, and Michael Rooker, who are filming a zombie movie on-site along with director George A. Romero, who had been infected as well. Richtofen requests the four celebrities to find a golden rod, which is a Vril generator device, which he then uses to fix the teleporter. He transports himself and the other three soldiers back to Shangri-La, leaving the celebrities behind to continue fighting Romero and the horde. At Shangri-La, the group discovers two explorers, Gary and Brock, who died trapped within a time loop while trying to discover the secrets of the mythical Agartha realm. The group saves the explorers' lives by traveling back and forth in time, altering the environments of the temple in the process. They discover an altar within the temple with Richtofen's name written on it, as well as a piece of a meteorite containing Element 115. However, the explorers remain stuck in the never-ending loop.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to just keep doing {{things the way they}} have been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", as well as the decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} ending {{was made}} for the special which was never broadcast, but was put as an extra on the DVD.

2500|$|Al Larsen of {{the band}} Some Velvet Sidewalk {{was part of the}} K Roster.

2500|$|Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone {{noted the}} lack of {{religious}} references in the album's lyrics before adding: [...] "But 'Grey Cloudy Lies' makes up in its cathectic repetition of Krishna homiletics for whatever the others have skipped ... Witless and ponderous as any previous hymn to the godhead, they drag Extra Texture down with them after its brief flurry of excitement." [...] In Melody Maker, Ray Coleman said the album was a [...] "lovely collection of songs by a musician with integrity" [...] and that [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] was [...] "perhaps {{the most difficult of}} all the tracks to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of" [...] on initial listening. He also highlighted the song's [...] "unusual chords" [...] and the [...] "especially pretty" [...] piano part.|$|E
2500|$|The game plays as a 2D sidescrolling {{platformer}} {{with elements}} of a run and gun game as well. The player controls Jim and must maneuver him through the level while avoiding obstacles and enemies. The player can use Jim's gun {{as a method of}} shooting enemies, or his head as a whip for whipping enemies. The whip move also allows the player to <b>grab</b> <b>hold</b> of, and swing from, certain hooks in the game. Some levels have additional requirements beyond merely getting {{to the end of the}} level. For example, the level [...] "For Pete's Sake", involves making sure the computer-controlled Peter Puppy character gets through the level unharmed, which is accomplished by whipping him to make him jump over pits, and defeating enemies before they can damage him. Failure to do so results in Peter lashing out at Jim, taking away from his health.|$|E
