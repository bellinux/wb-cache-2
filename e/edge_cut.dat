As they collected in a group in front of that mighty pale-blue wall, the danger to which the Professor had alluded became apparent, even to the most inexperienced eye among them. High on the summit of the precipice, where its <b>edge</b> <b>cut</b> sharply against the blue sky, could be seen the black boulders and debris of the lateral moraine of the glacier. The day was unusually warm, and the ice melted so rapidly that parts of this moraine were being sent down in frequent avalanches. The rustle of debris was almost incessant, and, ever and anon, the rustle rose into a roar as great boulders bounded over the edge, and, after dashing portions of the ice-cliffs into atoms, went smoking down into the chaos below. It was just beyond this chaos that the party stood.|$|E

50|$|The fault {{motion of}} the Lewis thrust is dated based on the oldest age for motion being defined by the {{youngest}} sediments on the footwall, which {{are said to be}} about 65 million years old. Fission track analysis of Uranium-bearing minerals such as Zircons and Apatite which involves dating the radioactive uranium found in sediments along the Lewis thrust using isotopic ratios of Uranium provides constraints of the late pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient and thickness of the Lewis sheet. This data, after being calibrated into geologic ages, led to the conclusion that maximum burial and heating in the Lewis thrust occurred during the Campanian over a time interval of less than 15 million years {{prior to the start of}} movement of the thrust sheet. The Apatite fission track data showed abrupt change in paleotemperatures from high to low temperatures and associated changes in uranium concentrations as burial and heating came to a halt and movement and exhumation began, which showed that displacement of Mesoproterozoic strata of the Belt-Purcell Supergroup along the Lewis thrust fault was in motion by approximately 75 Ma.

5000|$|Bowie {{was seriously}} {{wounded in the}} {{confrontation}} (according to one account, two bullet wounds, seven stab wounds, and other injuries due to Crain's thrown pistol, or alternatively, three bullet and four stab wounds), and required months to recover. He prominently wore a large sheath knife thereafter. Thanks to the national attention drawn by the Sandbar Fight, Bowie and his knife became well-known throughout the country as icons of a rugged frontier lifestyle. Many craftsmen and manufacturers made their own versions of the so-called Bowie knife, beginning with James Black, a blacksmith from Arkansas who designed the original for Bowie in 1830. His fame, {{and that of his}} knife, spread to England, and by the early 1830s many British knife manufacturers were also producing Bowie knives and exporting them to the United States for sale. By 1835 (while Bowie was still alive), [...] "Bowie knives" [...] were advertised (without further explanation). By 1838, a newspaper writer from New Orleans assumed that everyone had seen one. Bowie knives remained popular weapons until at least the 1870s, when large-caliber reliable pistols became widely available. The design of the knife evolved into a wide range of blades during the nineteenth century. By the middle of the twentieth century, it was associated with a more specific design: a large sheath knife with a [...] "concave clip point, sharp false <b>edge</b> <b>cut</b> from both sides, and a cross-guard to protect the user's hands".|$|E
5000|$|Mirrors, {{which were}} very rare in Elizabeth's time, became {{more common in}} that of the Charleses, the Duke of Buckingham, {{during the reign of}} the second Charles, {{bringing}} a colony of Venetian glassmakers to Lambeth. One Elizabethan mirror is some three and a half by four and a half feet in size — five feet was the largest made till {{the latter part of the}} eighteenth century — the frame is carved in oak and partially gilt, and the glass is set flatly. In one mirror of the time of Charles II the glass is beveled, and in the glasses of the Merry Monarch's predecessor the frames were so made as to throw the glass forward and give it projection. Quicksilvered glass itself, unset, became a novelty, so that sometimes whole rooms, and even the ceilings, were lined with it. The mirrors made by the duke's colony were of superior excellence; they had an inch-wide bevel all along their outer extremity, whether they were rectangular or curved. [...] "This," [...] says Mr. Pollen, [...] "gives preciousness and prismatic light to the whole glass. It is of great difficulty in execution, the plate being held by the workman over his head, and the <b>edge</b> <b>cut</b> by grinding. The feats of skill in this kind, in the form of interrupted curves and short lines and angles, are rarely accomplished by modern workmen, and the angle of the bevel itself is generally too acute, whereby the prismatic light produced by this portion of the mirror is in violent and too showy contrast to the remainder." ...|$|E
