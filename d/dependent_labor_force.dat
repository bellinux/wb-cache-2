40|$|The Austrian {{economy has}} been struck by the most recent {{business}} cycle downturn in Europe. At the same time, a two-year program of fiscal consolidation has been launched comprising all levels of government, {{with the aim of}} bringing down public sector borrowing to 3 percent of GDP by 1997. In the short run, lackluster demand from abroad and real income losses of private households will considerably dampen the pace of activity. As from 1998, demand and output should rebound strongly and advance by nearly 3 percent p. a. until the year 2000. On average for the period 1995 - 2000, real GDP may rise by only 1. 8 percent p. a., thereby falling somewhat behind the pace in the EU (projected at 2. 1 percent). A more competitive environment adds to the pressure for rationalization and efforts to save labor as input for production. The public sector is unlikely to expand its personnel capacities in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the number of jobs may not increase over the projection period, leading to a marked increase in unemployment. In 1998, the jobless rate may attain 8 percent (of the <b>dependent</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> as conventionally measured), before abating to 7 ½ percent by 2000. Labor market and wage developments are closely interrelated. Real wages are expected to increase at a markedly slower pace than labor productivity. Inflation should remain firmly under control, as neither import prices nor wage costs are likely to exert significant upward pressure. The new setting of fiscal policy and the projected international scenario will allow government borrowing to decline to a ratio of 3 percent of GDP by 1997, thereby meeting the relevant convergence criterion for participation in the European Monetary Union. Thereafter, with economic growth accelerating and public authorities maintaining tight control over expenditure, the deficit/GDP ratio may continue falling to 2 percent by the year 2000.

To extend this analysis, the model constructed for this study, while regressing the minimum wage on the aggregate employment, full time and part time employment, and labor force participation of adult women, controls for the unemployment rate and the presence of children, as do Mincer (2) and Gramlich (1), and also controls for female earnings, the husband 2 ̆ 7 s income and welfare supplements. To test for a discriminant impact, the <b>dependent</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> variable is also categorized by race, marital status, and marital status and age, and the dependent employment variable is categorized by race, full time and part time and marital status. Due to data limitations on the dependent variables by marital status and age, these equations use annual data. All other models use quarterly data;The re-estimation of the Mincer (2) and Gramlich (1) models suggest that minimum wage legislation does not adversely affect the aggregate employment and labor force participation of adult women but that it does augment the part time employment of these women.

40|$|Exports and {{manufacturing}} output {{continue to be}} the mainstay of Austria's economic upswing. Economic activity in retail trade and construction remains subdued, but not as sluggish as in Germany. Price stability persists. Despite impressive employment gains, unemployment is markedly higher than one year ago. According to preliminary data, Austria's economy grew by 2 ½ percent in real terms in 1997; this growth rate is about as high as in the EU on average, but ¼ percentage point higher than in Germany. With merchandise exports expanding at double-digit rates, foreign trade continues to be the driving force of the cyclical upswing. According to the foreign trade statistics of the Central Statistical Office, shipments to countries outside of the EU expanded rapidly, with sales to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe posting the highest gains. A substantial trade surplus is being built up vis-à-vis these regions. The vigorous export growth has boosted economic activity in the manufacturing sector; output is estimated to have expanded by 4 ½ percent in 1997. According to the WIFO business survey, expectations continue to be optimistic. The development of employment in this sector suggests that the steep increase in the output of intermediary and investment goods can no longer be supported by drawing on productivity reserves. While at the beginning of 1997 job losses amounted to 14, 000 on a year-on-year basis, the number of persons on the manufacturing payroll in January 1998 was just slightly below the level recorded in January 1997 (– 1, 500). In the first two months of 1998 dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) substantially exceeded the level recorded during the same period of 1997 (+ 23, 000 and + 24, 000). To the cyclical relief in the demand for labor in manufacturing must be added the persistent rise in labor demand in two sectors, the producer-oriented services sector and the public sector. The employment gains have mostly benefited female workers, many of whom are employed in part-time jobs. The favorable employment trend cannot give rise to a sanguine evaluation of the labor market, however, because unemployment is still on the rise: in February the number of jobless exceeded last year's level by some 7, 000. But this increase is partly due to institutional factors. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4. 5 percent of the total labor force according to Eurostat calculations, and 7. 1 percent of the <b>dependent</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> according to the traditional Austrian method. There were 15 unemployed for each vacancy. Price stability continues to characterize Austria's economy: at the level of consumer prices, the rate of inflation was as low as 1. 2 percent in January, with rental prices posting the highest increase (3. 7 percent). Various factors, such as the very moderate rise in labor costs, the restrained domestic demand, intense competitive pressures, and the drop in energy prices, contributed to this favorable performance. Austria's integration into the EU has also exerted considerable downward pressure on prices; this price effect is now spreading from manufactured goods to services.

40|$|Based on the {{introduction}} of research theories about rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer at home and abroad, taking Liaocheng City as the representative of medium and small cities, transfer situation of rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> in Liaocheng City is discussed from several aspects, including the transfer of total <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> structure of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> flow of regional <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> industry selection of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and income of <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Combining with the situation of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer in Liaocheng City, social benefits, including both negative and positive benefits, of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer are analyzed. From the aspect of positive benefit, foreign labor is one of premier builders for in-flow area (city), fills in the structural lack of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and has made huge contributions to urban construction. Meanwhile, for out-flow area (village), transfer of surplus <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> can reduce the employment pressure in rural areas, increase the income of peasant households, and promote the development of rural economy. From the aspect of negative benefit, {{a large number of}} <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> pouring into cities will bring pressure on the transportation and infrastructure, increase the instability factor of city, and cause difficulties in the management of city. At the same time, a large number of young <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> work in cities, leaving only the old and sick in rural areas. This might become a hidden danger to the development of agriculture. Push-Pull Theory is used to analyze the socio-economic factors affecting <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer.

40|$|Manufacturing posted strong {{gains in}} Austria, but the WIFO {{business}} survey indicated a slight cooling {{of the business}} climate. Unemployment continues to rise despite substantial employment expansion. The deficit in the current account is shrinking markedly. In {{the first quarter of}} 1998, real GDP rose by 4. 2 percent on a year-on-year basis. This favorable development was mainly due to the expansion in the manufacturing sector {{as well as to the}} rise in construction activity, owing to clement weather at the beginning of the year. Manufacturing activity continues at a lively pace. The results from the most recent business survey signal, however, that growth rates will decline somewhat. A high level of output is expected over the next few months, but compared to the survey from April there are signs of a slight restraint. The growth in demand and in output is shifting markedly from the basic-goods industry, which expanded significantly at the beginning of the recovery, to those sectors which are more dependent on domestic demand. So far, foreign demand has also held up. The expansionary effects of the upturn in the economies of Austria's west and east European trading partners, as well as the improvement in the competitive position of Austria's export sector still outweigh the negative effects of the economic crisis in the Far East. Merchandise exports post high growth rates, markedly above those recorded for imports. According to the foreign trade statistics, exports rose by 9 percent from January to April, on a year-on-year basis. The balance of payments statistics record a surge in exports of 12 percent for the first five months of the year, resulting in a reduction of the trade deficit by ATS 3 billion, compared to 1997. This development and the turnaround in the tourism balance contributed to a narrowing of the deficit in the current account by ATS 5 ½ billion. The economic recovery is spreading to domestic demand. With the rise in per-capita income remaining rather modest, the rise in disposable income can be largely attributed to sizable employment gains. With a real growth rate of 1 ¼ percent in the first quarter, private consumption has become an important element of aggregate demand. During the first four months, retail sales exceeded last year's level by 2 percent in real terms, partly as a result of the upswing in tourism. Construction activity, which was buoyed by special factors in the first quarter of 1998, remains flat, however: demand for new housing is weak, but civil engineering is booming. The expansion of demand and production has had a positive impact on the labor market. In July, dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) exceeded the level in the corresponding period of 1997 by 39, 000 (by 30, 000 on average during the first seven months). The service sector posted the highest increase (33, 000 in the second quarter); even the manufacturing industry created 2, 000 additional jobs. Nonetheless, unemployment continued to rise as a result of demographic and institutional factors, as well as of the heavy inflow of labor from hidden unemployment (July + 4, 500). The unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) was 4. 6 percent of the total labor force according to the definitions of the EU Labour Force Survey, and 7. 3 percent of the <b>dependent</b> <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> according to the traditional Austrian method of calculation.

This heterogeneity enters the projection methodology through population projection data as well as <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation data, since both components are decomposed in the three dimensions of age, sex, and education. Based on data from the European <b>Labor</b> <b>Force</b> Survey (EU LFS), three scenarios were designed to project the economically active population for 26 EU countries up to 2053. RESULTS: Adding the educational dimension to <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> projections discloses a significant shift towards tertiary education degrees between 2008 and 2053.

Using discrete-time event history analysis, I find that wives who outearn their husbands {{are more likely to}} exit the <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> An interaction with other family income (excluding the wife's earnings) reveals that the main effect of the wife as a primary provider is negative, and primary provider wives are more likely to exit the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> as other family income rises. I also find that married mothers who delay childbearing are more likely to exit the <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> An interaction with personal earnings lends support to the life course perspective's argument that delayed childbearers may believe that they can reenter the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> without suffering downward mobility, as high earners who delay childbearing more likely to exit <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> However, an interaction with education level does not, as delayed childbearers with a college degree are less likely to exit the <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> It appears that entrances are driven more by the human capital attributes and <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> commitment of the mother than by family considerations. The effect of predicted wages on entrances into part-time employment is positive, suggesting that married mothers who are predicted to attain higher wages may be able to use their higher market value to negotiate part-time employment. <b>Labor</b> <b>force</b> exits do not appear to differ by the reason for the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> exit [...] the determinants of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> exits appear to be similar regardless of whether the mother exits to care for children and family or for other reasons.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the evidence of}} the impact of income taxation on the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation in three transition economies, namely, Bulgaria, Russian Federation and Serbia. The evidence suggests that countries which inherited high <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation rates are relatively insensitive to changes in the wage rates induced by the changes in the personal income taxation. The estimations have been performed using Heckman (1979) methodology and results showed relatively small wage elasticities of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation for both men and women. In contrast, the sensitivity of the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation decision to changes in wages is found to be bigger for females. The insensitivity of the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation to changes in personal income taxation in all countries under the study may bear serious implications for tax policy design.
