5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it is {{most likely}} to be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> {{detected}} indirectly through observations of the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The reservoir, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} Nant Fawr corridor, has been {{redundant}} since the 1970s and <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> used for leisure purposes and for 'topping up' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E

5|$|Afrasia <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> {{found in}} the Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places {{it at the end}} of the Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a rare species.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{begins to}} have {{difficulty}} answering {{the questions on}} her phone.

Alice and John visit Anna in the hospital to meet their newborn twin grandchildren, but Alice does not recognize her daughter.|$|E
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Beonna's rule {{coincided with}} the anointing of Pippin III as king of the Franks after 742 and the {{subsequent}} disempowerment of the Merovingian dynasty, and also with the martyrdom of Saint Boniface and his followers in Frisia in 754. Two coins use a runic 'a' in the name Beonna; the runic 'a' <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> found elsewhere in Frisia, suggesting that there were both trading and language links between Frisia and East Anglia during the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, the phrase has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer {{for the soul of}} the condemned. However, in later times, particularly in the United States, it <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> said as a result of legal tradition where the religious meaning and origin is not founded on belief.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which <b>has</b> <b>only</b> <b>been</b> described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
