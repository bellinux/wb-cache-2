He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a wig over his <b>hairpiece,</b> rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.|$|E

The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of Texas Monthly magazine, two 1974 issues of Playboy magazine, {{was the basis for}} the Broadway and film musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and served as the basis of the song La Grange by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched toupee.

These included the successful Henry Koster outing Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962), and the less memorable films Take Her, She's Mine (1963) and Dear Brigitte (1965), which featured French model Brigitte Bardot {{as the object of}} Stewart's son's mash notes. The Civil War period film Shenandoah (1965) and the western family film The Rare Breed fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a hit in the South.|$|E

Over the years, Stewart took roles in many major television series without ever becoming a household name. He appeared as Vladimir Lenin in Fall of Eagles; Sejanus in I, Claudius; Karla in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People; Claudius in a 1980 BBC adaptation of Hamlet.

[...] Key to the promotion and acceptance of Toupées was improved toupée craftsmanship, pioneered by Max Factor. [...] Factor's toupées were carefully made and almost invisible, with each strand of hair sewed to a piece of fine flesh-colored lace, and in a variety of long and short hairstyles. [...] Factor, also a Hollywood makeup innovator, was the supplier of choice for most Hollywood actors.|$|R

500|$|The {{series was}} filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were {{directed}} by Douglas Mackinnon {{and the second}} three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a <b>hairpiece</b> lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde [...] "soulless". After many debates, the producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did {{not appear in the}} script.|$|E

The next scene has Kesha at a bar playing pool near a man, where she duct-tapes him, later pulling down his pants, after describing him as a [...] "tool bag" [...] in a text message. In an arcade, Kesha pushes a man away who is making conversation with her. The third suitor attempts to serenade Kesha with a guitar, to which Kesha replies by stuffing paper in his mouth. In the final sequence, a man tries to talk to Kesha in a bowling alley. She loses interest when his toupée falls off his head and she shoves the <b>hairpiece</b> into his mouth, in vein of the previous arcade scene. The video ends with Kesha and 3OH!3 singing and dancing together in the bowling lanes.|$|E

Mulligan is British and had to speak with an American accent for her role. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was her first major studio film. When she first met Stone for the role she explained that she did not want her character to be a [...] "token girlfriend;" [...] both agreed to work to make sure that would not happen. During the same encounter Stone learned that she had short hair, and he initially discussed having her wear a wig, but Mulligan said she did not feel like herself when wearing the <b>hairpiece.</b> Stone trusted her and made an exception. According to Mulligan, Stone cast her in the Wall Street sequel based on her performance in An Education (2009).|$|E

500|$|Chinga, the titular evil doll, {{was created}} by sewing {{together}} various doll parts. An oversized doll's head {{was placed on the}} finished body and [...] "the world's largest wig" [...] adorned its head. Props master Ken Hawryliw later reported that the <b>hairpiece</b> was actually the result of several wigs being sewn together. Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala, who [...] "appreciate the chance to create these classics for a Stephen King project". The [...] "Death Under Glass" [...] scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post-production via a computer. Special effects supervisor Laurie Kellsen-George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven-year-old sons, explaining that [...] "I gauge a lot of the show by whether my kids can stand them or not. If they can't, I figure I succeeded [...] 'Chinga' bothered them a lot."

500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 19, 1995, through MTV. It {{features}} Madonna, her dancers, and her chihuahua Chiquita in black leather and latex outfits.

She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a <b>hairpiece.</b> During {{the middle of the}} video, Madonna and her dancers appear in a series of boxes, trying to break free. Another sequence shows the singer being thrown around within a series of ropes managed by her dancers. As the video concludes there is a shot of Madonna sitting in a chair, looking straight into the camera as she says the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets!". Then there is a brief shot of her standing next to the chair as she boxes into the air.|$|E
500|$|... "The Bill" [...] {{opens with}} the mundane {{image of a}} number of men eating at a {{restaurant}} and arguing about the bill, but then [...] "takes that familiar scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes". In a reversal of the norm, all diners want to pay the whole bill, rather than wanting to limit their payment. In this dispute, [...] "The Bill" [...] explores themes of masculinity, losing face, competitiveness, passive aggression and rivalry. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, compared this aspect of the episode to Mad Dogs, which had also starred Glenister; one critic suggested that Glenister's character in Mad Dogs and Craig in [...] "The Bill" [...] are close. The characters tell [...] "well-rehearsed anecdotes and blokey jokes", while Craig is [...] "all flash-cash and inappropriate comments to the waitress". Pemberton's Malcolm, for Michael Hogan of the Daily Telegraph, [...] "appeared to have wandered in" [...] from a Mike Leigh production; a number of critics commented on his striking <b>hairpiece.</b> All four of the men are unpleasant people.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a <b>hairpiece</b> but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} become the {{character}} of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s [...] "Italian Boy" [...] hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated {{that as soon as}} Dot's <b>hairpiece</b> is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 when she left the serial. Brown commented, [...] "I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she looks really smart. She's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman!" ...|$|E
