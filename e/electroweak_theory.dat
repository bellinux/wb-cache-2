5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near {{the surface of the}} Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory,</b> which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.|$|E

25|$|Since gluons carry color charge, two gluons {{can also}} interact. A typical {{interaction}} vertex (called the three gluon vertex) for gluons involves g+g→g. This is shown here, {{along with its}} color-line representation. The color-line diagrams can be restated in terms of conservation laws of color; however, as noted before, {{this is not a}} gauge invariant language. Note that in a typical non-abelian gauge theory the gauge boson carries the charge of the theory, and hence has interactions of this kind; for example, the Wboson in the <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory.</b> In the <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory,</b> the W also carries electric charge, and hence interacts with a photon.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{spectacular}} success of quantum electrodynamics in the 1950s, attempts were undertaken {{to formulate a}} similar theory of the weak nuclear force. This culminated around 1968 in a unified theory of electromagnetism and weak interactions by Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam, for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. Their <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory</b> postulated not only the W bosons necessary to explain beta decay, but also a new Z boson {{that had never been}} observed.|$|E
25|$|Additionally the Standard Model {{contains}} a high energy unification of the <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory</b> {{with the strong}} force, described by quantum chromodynamics.

25|$|QCD {{does not}} violate the CP-symmetry as easily as the electroweak theory; unlike the <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory</b> in which the gauge fields couple to chiral {{currents}} constructed from the fermionic fields, the gluons couple to vector currents.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the W and Z bosons was considered a major success for CERN. First, in 1973, came the observation of neutral current interactions as predicted by <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory.</b> The huge Gargamelle bubble chamber photographed the tracks of a few electrons suddenly starting to move, seemingly of their own accord. This is interpreted as a neutrino interacting with the electron by the exchange of an unseen Z boson. The neutrino is otherwise undetectable, so the only observable effect is the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction.|$|E
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the {{strong nuclear force}} is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons.

With his student, Riazuddin, Salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos, neutron stars and black holes, as well as the work on modernising the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. As a teacher and science promoter, Salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in Pakistan during his term as the chief scientific advisor to the president. Salam heavily contributed to the rise of Pakistani physics to the physics community in the world. Even until shortly before his death, Salam continued to contribute to physics, and to advocate for the development of science in Third-World countries.|$|E
25|$|Salam had a {{prolific}} research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. Salam {{had worked on}} theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry {{in the theory of}} neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin, who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone's theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry. In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in <b>electroweak</b> <b>theory,</b> and thus theorised the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon.|$|E
