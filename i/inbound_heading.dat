50|$|At a {{controlled}} airport, {{air traffic control}} will direct aircraft to the localizer course via assigned headings, making sure aircraft do not {{get too close to}} each other (maintain separation), but also avoiding delay as much as possible. Several aircraft can be on the ILS at the same time, several miles apart. An aircraft that has turned onto the <b>inbound</b> <b>heading</b> and is within two and a half degrees of the localizer course (half scale deflection or less shown by the course deviation indicator) is said to be established on the approach. Typically, an aircraft is established by at least 2 nmi km prior to the final approach fix (glideslope intercept at the specified altitude).|$|E

[...] There was thereafter no steam tug on the Columbia river bar until 1869.|$|R
40|$|Networks exhibiting "accelerating" growth have total link numbers {{growing faster}} than linearly with network size and can exhibit {{transitions}} from stationary to nonstationary statistics and from random to scale-free to regular statistics at particular critical network sizes. However, if for any reason the network cannot tolerate such gross structural changes then accelerating networks are constrained to have sizes below some critical value. This is of interest as the regulatory gene networks of single celled prokaryotes are characterized by an accelerating quadratic growth and are size constrained {{to be less than}} about 10, 000 genes encoded in DNA sequence of less than about 10 megabases. This paper presents a probabilistic accelerating network model for prokaryotic gene regulation which closely matches observed statistics by employing two classes of network nodes (regulatory and non-regulatory) and directed links whose <b>inbound</b> <b>heads</b> are exponentially distributed over all nodes and whose outbound tails are preferentially attached to regulatory nodes and described by a scale free distribution. This model explains the observed quadratic growth in regulator number with gene number and predicts an upper prokaryote size limit closely approximating the observed value.

50|$|The {{station is}} use by {{all but one}} Gladstone Branch train, No.467, which terminates at Murray Hill. The first weekday train heading to New York Pennsylvania Station or Hoboken Terminal arrives at Millington at 5:05 am heading to Hoboken. The last train <b>heading</b> <b>inbound</b> to New York/Hoboken leaves at 12:12 am {{the next morning and}} heads for Hoboken Terminal. Heading {{westbound}} from Hoboken/New York, the first Gladstone Branch train arrives at 8:26 am, heading for Bernardsville. The last westbound train arrives at the station at 1:50 the next morning heading to Gladstone. On weekends, a transfer is necessary to a Morristown Line train at Summit, which accesses to New York and Hoboken. <b>Heading</b> <b>inbound</b> the first train arrives at Millington at 6:23 am and the final arrives at 12:48 the next morning. On holidays, the first train arrives at 5:54 am. Heading outbound, the first train arrives at 7:28 am and the last arrives at 2:39 am.|$|R

At West Portal Station, <b>inbound</b> K trains <b>heading</b> towards downtown change their signs to the T line; conversely, at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line.

5000|$|The {{original}} Wickham railway station, {{opened in}} 1936, featured two side brick faced and asphalt-surface platforms, each able to fit four cars {{of a modern}} electric multiple unit train.

5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys <b>heading</b> <b>inbound</b> to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|R
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the <b>inbound</b> track, both <b>heading</b> northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel straight on from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|R
2500|$|The CNW {{was known}} for running [...] "left-hand main" [...] on double track mainlines.

5000|$|The Union Terminal served most rail lines: the Baltimore and Ohio, New York Central and Nickel Plate Road. Exceptions {{were the}} Pennsylvania Railroad and {{initially}} the Erie Railroad [...] - [...] from completion until 1973. It was never particularly {{popular with the}} railroads, however. It required deviating from the quicker route along Lake Erie. As the city would not allow trains to operate under steam power near the downtown area, trains were forced to switch from steam to electric power at a suburban rail yard when <b>heading</b> <b>inbound</b> and then reverse {{on the way out}} at another yard. As a result, some lines began to bypass the station entirely, heading along the lake route, and some trains stopped serving the city altogether. Several east-west routes by-passed the city to the south, passing through Akron or Youngstown. In addition, national passenger rail travel had already passed its peak and was starting its gradual decline in favor of the automobile and, later, the airplane. The Erie RR, owned by the Van Sweringens, could not afford the electric transfer and continued to use its own nearby station until 1948, when it replaced steam with diesel locomotives and was able to serve the Union Terminal under its own power.|$|R
40|$|International audienceForaging in leaf-cutting ants is {{generally}} organized along well-defined recruitment trails supporting a bi-directional flow of outbound and nestbound individuals. This study attempts {{to reveal the}} priority rules governing the organization of traffic on these trails. Ants were forced to move on a narrow trail, allowing the passage of only two individuals at a time. In this condition, a desynchronization of inbound and outbound traffic was observed, involving the formation of alternating clusters of inbound and outbound ants. Most clusters of <b>inbound</b> ants were <b>headed</b> by laden ants followed by unladen ants. This occurred because inbound unladen ants {{did not attempt to}} overtake the laden ants in front of them. As unladen ants move on average faster than laden ants, these ants were thus forced to decrease their speed. By contrast, this decrease was counterbalanced by the fact that, by staying in a cluster instead of moving in isolation, inbound unladen ants limit the number of head-on encounters with outbound ants. Our analysis shows that the delay induced by these head-on encounters would actually be twice as high as the delay induced by the forced decrease in speed incurred by ants staying in a cluster. The cluster organization also promotes information transfer about the level of food availability by increasing the number of contacts between outbound and inbound laden ants, which could possibly stimulate these former to cut and retrieve leaf fragments when reaching the end of the trail...|$|R
