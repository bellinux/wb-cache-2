40|$|As {{a special}} {{version of the}} good-genes hypothesis, it was {{recently}} proposed that females could bene¢t from choosing drive-resistant males in a meiotic drive system. Here, we examine with a three-locus, six-allele population genetic model whether female choice for <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> can evolve. An allele leading to female preference for drive-resistant males was introduced at low frequency into a population poly-morphic for meiotic drive and <b>drive</b> <b>resistance.</b> Our simulations show that female choice of drive-resistant males is disadvantageous when resistance is Y-linked. This disadvantage occurs because, at equilibrium, drive-resistant males have lower reproductive success than drive-susceptible males. Thus, female choice of drive-susceptible males can evolve when resistance is Y-linked. When resistance is autosomal, selection on female choice for <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> is less strong and depends on the frequency of choice: female preference of resistant males is favoured when choice is rare and disadvantageous when choice is frequent, leading to a stable equilibrium at a low frequency of the choice allele.

40|$|Summary: Diverse {{pathways}} <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> to BRAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma, {{suggesting that}} durable control of resistance {{will be a}} challenge. By combining statistical modeling of genomic data from matched pre-treatment and post-relapse patient tumors with functional interrogation of > 20 inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo resistance models, we discovered that major pathways of resistance converge to activate the transcription factor, c-MYC (MYC). MYC expression and pathway gene signatures were suppressed following drug treatment, and then rebounded during progression. Critically, MYC activation was necessary and sufficient for resistance, and suppression of MYC activity using genetic approaches or BET bromodomain inhibition was sufficient to resensitize cells and delay BRAFi resistance. Finally, MYC-driven, BRAFi-resistant cells are hypersensitive to the inhibition of MYC synthetic lethal partners, including SRC family and c-KIT tyrosine kinases, as well as glucose, glutamine, and serine metabolic pathways. These insights enable the design of combination therapies that select against resistance evolution. : Diverse pathways <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> to BRAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma, but by combining statistical modeling of tumor data with functional interrogation of resistance models, Singleton etÂ al. show that these pathways converge to activate MYC.

Based on an empirical study, we explore and elaborate on the rhetorical strategies of emotion work that institutional actors employ to mobilize emotions for discursive institutional work. In an empirical context where a powerful institutional actor is tasked with creating support and acceptance for a new political and economic institution, we identify three rhetorical strategies of emotion work: eclipsing, diverting and evoking emotions. These strategies are employed to arouse, regulate, and organize emotions that underpin legitimacy judgments and <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> among field constituents. We find that actors exercise influence and engage in overt forms of emotion work by evoking shame and pride to sanction and reward particular expedient ways of thinking and feeling about the new institutional arrangements.

40|$|ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) promote {{repair of}} DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and {{disruption}} of this pathway by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) is toxic to cells with defects in homologous recombination (HR). Here {{we show that}} this relationship is conserved in the simple eukaryote Dictyostelium and exploit this organism to define mechanisms that <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> of HR-deficient cells to PARPi. Dictyostelium cells disrupted in exonuclease I, a critical factor for HR, are sensitive to PARPi. Deletion of exo 1 prevents the accumulation of Rad 51 in chromatin induced by PARPi, resulting in DNA damage being channelled through repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Inactivation of NHEJ supresses the sensitivity of exo 1 - cells to PARPi, indicating this pathway drives synthetic lethality and that in its absence alternative repair mechanisms promote cell survival. This resistance is independent of alternate-NHEJ and is instead achieved by re-activation of HR. Moreover, inhibitors of Mre 11 restore sensitivity of dnapkcs exo 1 - cells to PARPi, indicating redundancy between nucleases that initiate HR can drive PARPi resistance. These data inform on mechanism of PARPi resistance in HR-deficient cells and present Dictyostelium as a convenient genetic model to characterise these pathways. </p...|$|E

40|$|From the {{publisher}} 2 ̆ 7 s website: Resistance to antifungals {{is a major}} concern in the management of fungal infections, especially while the incidence of pathogens with a poor susceptibility to current treatments is rising. New therapeutic strategies could be developed through the discovery of completely new fungal-specific targets or through the identification of new effectors of resistance to existing antifungals. In addition to basic molecular resistance mechanisms that are well understood, there are also numerous additional effectors able to modulate fungi susceptibility to the four main classes of antifungals. These effectors are unable to <b>drive</b> <b>resistance</b> alone, but they are now believed to be crucial for the establishment and maintenance of drug resistance, as they constitute key modulators allowing the phenotypic expression of resistance acquired by basic mechanisms.

Resistance to chemotherapy is often linked to dysfunction of tumor suppressor p 53; however, it remains elusive whether the ECM microenvironment interferes with p 53 activation in cancer cells. Here, we show that, in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, extracellular stiffness influences p 53 activation induced by the antitumor drug doxorubicin. Cell growth inhibition by doxorubicin was increased in response to ECM rigidity in a p 53 -dependent manner. The expression of Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2, which induces the activation of myosin II, was significantly higher when cells were cultured on stiffer ECM substrates.

40|$|Although sociologists {{and psychologists}} have {{documented}} various motivations for working, {{the concept of}} work as essentially disutility or undesirable retains broad resonance among influential economists and social theorists. These concepts imply that workers will tend to avoid or ‘shirk’ their work task unless subjected to management controls. Yet emerging counter-narratives have sought to retrieve and develop alternative concepts of work as craft, where workers are motivated to work well or be recognized for doing so. On these approaches, management controls can decrease {{the quality of the}} final outputs. This article uses a case study of cleaners in Australia to challenge influential representations of workers as prone to ‘shirking’ and the interpretation of management control to which these perspectives lead. The article argues that craft concepts of work derived from Richard Sennett and contemporary recognition theory provide alternative narratives of how workers can derive satisfaction from working well even in ‘menial’ tasks, and how craft motivations can drive workers to subvert management controls to uphold rather than diminish service quality.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of resistance {{is a problem}} shared by both classical chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Patients may respond well at first, but relapse is inevitable for many cancer patients, despite many improvements in drugs and their use over the last 400 years. Review Resistance to anti-cancer drugs can be acquired by several mechanisms within neoplastic cells, defined as (1) alteration of drug targets, (2) expression of drug pumps, (3) expression of detoxification mechanisms, (4) reduced susceptibility to apoptosis, (5) increased ability to repair DNA damage, and (6) altered proliferation. It is clear, however, that changes in stroma and tumour microenvironment, and local immunity can {{also contribute to the}} {{development of}} resistance. Cancer cells can and do use several of these mechanisms at one time, and there is considerable heterogeneity between tumours, necessitating an individualised approach to cancer treatment. As tumours are heterogeneous, positive selection of a drug-resistant population could help <b>drive</b> <b>resistance,</b> although acquired resistance cannot simply be viewed as overgrowth of a resistant cancer cell population. The development of such resistance mechanisms can be predicted from pre-existing genomic and proteomic profiles, and there are increasingly sophisticated methods to measure and then tackle these mechanisms in patients. Conclusion The oncologist is now required to be at least one step ahead of the cancer, a process that can be likened to 2 ̆ 018 molecular chess 2 ̆ 019. Thus, as well as an increasing role for predictive biomarkers to clinically stratify patients, it is becoming clear that personalised strategies are required to obtain best results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Targeted therapies {{have opened}} new {{perspectives}} in clinical oncology. However, clinicians have observed {{a lack of}} response in a relevant percentage of patients and frequent relapse in patients who initially respond. Therefore, a compelling challenge is to identify mechanisms underlying resistance and strategies to circumvent these hurdles. A {{growing body of evidence}} indicates that MET, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is fre-quently implicated in resistance to targeted therapies. In this review, we highlight cell-autonomous and non–cell-autonomous mechanisms through which MET <b>drives</b> <b>resistance,</b> and we discuss some unsolved issues related to the selection of patients who could benefi t from combined therapies. Signifi cance: Resistance is, at present, the major limitation to the effi cacy of targeted therapies. Inappropriate MET activation is very frequently implicated in the onset of primary and secondary resistance to these therapies. Deciphering the role of the HGF/MET axis in resistance to different drugs could guide the design of new clinical trials based on combinatorial therapies, and it might help to overcome, or possibly prevent, the onset of resistance.
