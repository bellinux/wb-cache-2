50|$|The May Day demonstrations {{are still}} an {{important}} part of Swedish politics for the social democrats, left-wing parties and unions who use May Day to discuss their politics. In Stockholm the Social Democratic Party always marches towards Norra Bantorget, the centre of the Swedish labour movement, to hold speeches in front of the headquarters of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, while the smaller Left Party marches in larger numbers towards Kungsträdgården. Since 1967, the Communist Party and its youth wing, Revolutionary Communist Youth, have held their own May Day march, known as <b>Röd</b> <b>Front</b> ('Red Front'). In 2016, <b>Röd</b> <b>Front</b> marches were held at 33 different locations across the country. The largest <b>Röd</b> <b>Front</b> marches are usually held in Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city and one of the party's strongholds.|$|R

50|$|In {{place of}} the usual rear solid axle, there is {{independent}} suspension from lower wishbones, the original trailing arms, an upper strut and an anti-roll bar. At the <b>front</b> a radius <b>rod</b> on each side {{was added to the}} standard double wishbones.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a wishbone rear suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a <b>front</b> radius <b>rod.</b> This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm.|$|R

50|$|In early 1980, {{production}} on the pilot episode began on several <b>fronts.</b> <b>Rod</b> Lord of Pearce Animation Studios directed a 50-second pilot, hand-animated, giving a computer graphic feel to the Babel Fish speech {{of the first}} episode. Douglas Adams and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the go-ahead {{to do all of}} the animation for Episode 1, and subsequently the complete TV series. Narration for the first episode was recorded by Peter Jones in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters was done on 8 May 1980. Further filming of crowd reactions to the Vogons, location filming of Arthurs house and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and 16 May 1980. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on 7 June 1980, in the BBCs TC1 studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on 2 July 1980, and it was premiered for a test audience three days later (5 July 1980). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast was reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the autumn, with filming and recording occurring out of order. Recording and production of the final episode continued into January 1981.|$|R

The car smashed into the outside wall of the track and then rolled 325 feet along the barrier. The car came to rest in a grassy plot between the wall and Grandstand A, with {{the tail of the}} car on fire. Results showed the {{accident}} was caused by an anchor bolt which fell off the <b>front</b> radius <b>rod</b> support, allowing the front axle to twist and misalign the front wheels when the brakes were applied, which drove the car into the wall.|$|R
50|$|Lane {{formed the}} Faces with McLagan, Jones, Ronnie Wood and Rod Stewart in 1969. He shared primary songwriting duties with Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood, composing, or co-composing, {{many of their}} best-loved pieces and taking a central role during the {{recording}} of their fourth and final album, Ooh La La, particularly, as the band's <b>front</b> man <b>Rod</b> Stewart focused on his own solo career. Unhappy due to poor reviews of the album and Stewart's lack of commitment, Lane quit in 1973, making his last appearance at the Sundown Theatre in Edmonton, London, on 4 June. He was replaced by Tetsu Yamauchi but tellingly, the group made no further studio albums following Lane's departure and split in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|To contemporaries {{the model}} was {{generally}} known as the Daimler 2½-litre until Daimler adopted the North American habit of giving their cars names (although not on any badgework), and a slightly updated version of the car was introduced in October 1948 at the London Motor Show, [...] "principally for export" [...] and branded as the Daimler Consort. The updates included {{the integration of the}} firewall into the body rather than it being part of the chassis, a move from rod operated mechanical brakes to a Girling-Bendix hydraulic <b>front</b> and <b>rod</b> operated rear system, incorporating the head lights into the front guards, and providing a badge plate behind the front bumper with a more curved radiator grille.|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed the [...] "Tinley Park Express," [...] Tony Bettenhausen, Sr. {{was killed}} in a crash during a {{practice}} run on May 12. He was testing a car for Paul Russo. It was determined that an anchor bolt fell off the <b>front</b> radius <b>rod</b> support, permitting the front axle to twist and mis-align the front wheels when the brakes were applied. The car plunged into the outside wall, then rode along the top, snapping fence poles and tearing segments of the catch fence. The car came to rest upside-down on top of the outside wall, and Bettenhausen {{was killed in}}stantly. Before the time trials Bettenhausen had been the favorite to become the first driver to break the 150 mph barrier at the Speedway.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Jenson Button had a fantastic start, jumping his McLaren from second past Fernando Alonso's Ferrari. Alonso, who was {{alongside}} with his teammate Felipe Massa through the turn one chicane, just clipped the rear of Button's diffuser, but there was only light damage to the McLaren. As the pack headed down to the second chicane of turns three and four, Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton, who was in fourth, tried to pull a move on Massa, but there was contact between the two. Although Lewis tried to carry on, the <b>front</b> track <b>rod</b> was broken and he pulled up at the next corner. Massa managed to carry on unscathed. Kamui Kobayashi did start the race but retired his BMW Sauber on the first lap with a gearbox failure.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} very minor changes between the 1988 model {{year and the}} 1989-1991 model years. In 1989, the <b>front</b> {{suspension}} damper <b>rods</b> were changed to have only two (rather than four for the 1988) holes. The front brake calipers were also changed to have screw-on covers over the mounting pins. In 1991, the oil lines were run internally through the engine, rather than externally. The Canadian model was identical to the US model except for the colors.|$|R
40|$|The Sine-Gordon {{equation}} in (1 + 3) dimensions has N-traveling front ("kink", "domain wall") - {{solutions for}} all N ≥ 1.

The temporal evolution of multi-blob solutions mimics elastic collisions of systems of spatially extended particles...|$|R
5|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} into Wheldon's death were released on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right <b>front</b> pull <b>rod</b> of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|R
50|$|A non-rod non-cone {{photoreceptor}} in {{the eyes}} of mice, which was shown to mediate circadian rhythms, was discovered in 1991 by Foster et al. These neuronal cells, called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC), are a small subset (≈1-3%) of the retinal ganglion cells located in the inner retina, that is, in <b>front</b> of the <b>rods</b> and cones located in the outer retina. These light sensitive neurons contain a photopigment, melanopsin, which has an absorption peak of the light at a different wavelength (≈480 nm) than rods and cones. Beside circadian / behavioral functions, ipRGCs have a role in initiating the pupillary light reflex.|$|R
50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the axle. The radius arms were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the <b>front</b> linked radius <b>rods</b> provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe reflooding of {{the reactor}} core during a loss-of-coolant {{accident}} (LOCA) in a {{pressurized water reactor}} is a rather complex conjugate heat transfer situation. In the mist flow regime downward from the quench <b>front,</b> the <b>rod</b> wall can reach temperatures up to 1400 K, and radiative heat transfer can play a significant role. The present study concerns the accurate numerical computation of radiative heat transfer throughout a subchannel with LOCA representative flow conditions resolved at a computational fluid dynamics–scale spatial discretization thus allowing the large gradients of two-phase-flow properties to be determined. The accuracy of several methods to solve the radiative transfer equations has been compared both in canonical test cases and in low-pressure LOCA conditions. The role of radiative transfer is obvious in all variables including those related to {{the dynamics of the}} flow. Analysis of the gap between the present estimation and a standard correlation has been performed. It leads to the conclusion that radiative transfer can be taken into account accurately by correlation as soon as well-defined radiative properties are considered. The transfer is very sensitive to droplet size and concentration and can be as large as the convective heat transfer...|$|R
50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} {{acceleration of the}} rod, which is simultaneous in the grate's frame of reference, is not simultaneous in the rod's frame of reference. In the rod's frame of reference, {{the bottom of the}} <b>front</b> of the <b>rod</b> is first accelerated downward (not shown in drawing), and as time goes by, {{more and more of the}} rod is subjected to {{the downward}} acceleration, until finally the back of the rod is accelerated downward. This results in a bending of the rod in the rod's frame of reference. It should be stressed that, since this bending occurs in the rod's rest frame, it is a true physical distortion of the rod which will cause stresses to occur in the rod.|$|R

The quality of the chrome-plated finish was such that corrosion was a problem. The ignition lock was between the instrumentation, which consisted of two binnacles, one containing a speedometer; the other, a set of three warning lights (neutral, turn, high beam). The ignition key also activated both the steering lock and the lock on the plastic tool box located under the off-side side panel. The drum brakes were actuated by a cable in <b>front</b> and a <b>rod</b> in the rear.|$|R

2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the <b>front</b> pull <b>rod</b> compresses the <b>front</b> spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|R
