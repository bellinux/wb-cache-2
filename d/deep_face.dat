25|$|Surfing is {{a surface}} water sport {{in which the}} wave rider, {{referred}} to as a surfer, rides on the forward or <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers {{in the form of a}} standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.|$|E

The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.|$|E

Therefore, familiarity with its complex anatomy and thorough understanding of the imaging features of its common pathologies are mandatory to improve diagnostic accuracy as well as patient management [1 – 7].|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel online {{unsupervised}} method for face identity learning from video streams. The method exploits <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> descriptors {{together with a}} memory based learning mechanism that {{takes advantage of the}} temporal coherence of visual data. Specifically, we introduce a discriminative feature matching solution based on Reverse Nearest Neighbour and a feature forgetting strategy that detect redundant features and discard them appropriately while time progresses. It is shown that the proposed learning procedure is asymptotically stable and can be effectively used in relevant applications like multiple face identification and tracking from unconstrained video streams. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable results in the task of multiple face tracking and better performance in face identification with offline approaches exploiting future information.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel face feature {{extraction}} method based on deep learning. Using synthesized multi-view face images, we train a <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> feature (DFF) extractor {{based on the}} correlation between projections of a face point on images from different views. A feature vector can be extracted for each pixel of the face image based on the trained DFF model, and it {{is more effective than}} general purpose feature descriptors for face-related tasks such as alignment, matching, and reconstruction. Based on the DFF, we develop an effective face alignment method with single or multiple face images as input, which iteratively updates landmarks, pose and 3 D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art results for face alignment with a single image, and the alignment can be further improved with multi-view face images...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A major {{challenge}} in biometrics is {{performing the test}} at the client side, where hardware resources are often limited. Deep learning approaches pose a unique challenge: while such architectures dominate the field of face recognition with regards to accuracy, they require elaborate, multi-stage computations.

However, {{it is not clear that}} these compression methods would work in <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> nets, which are, generally speaking, less redundant than the object recognition networks, i. e., they are already relatively lean. We propose two novel methods for compression: one based on eliminating lowly active channels and the other on coupling pruning with repeated use of already computed elements. Pruning of entire channels is an appealing idea, since it leads to direct saving in run-time in almost every reasonable architecture. I...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a conceptually simple and geometrically interpretable {{objective}} function, i. e. additive margin Softmax (AM-Softmax), for <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> verification. In general, the face verification task {{can be viewed}} as a metric learning problem, so learning large-margin face features whose intra-class variation is small and inter-class difference is large is of great importance in order to achieve good performance. Recently, Large-margin Softmax and Angular Softmax have been proposed to incorporate the angular margin in a multiplicative manner. In this work, we introduce a novel additive angular margin for the Softmax loss, which is intuitively appealing and more interpretable than the existing works. We also emphasize and discuss the importance of feature normalization in the paper. Most importantly, our experiments on LFW BLUFR and MegaFace show that our additive margin softmax loss consistently performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods using the same network architecture and training dataset.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>deep</b> <b>face</b> recognition (FR) problem under open-set protocol, where ideal face {{features are}} expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. However, few existing algorithms can effectively achieve this criterion. To this end, we propose the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss that enables convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative features. Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter $m$. We further derive specific $m$ to approximate the ideal feature criterion. Extensive analysis and experiments on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF) and MegaFace Challenge show the superiority of A-Softmax loss in FR tasks. The code has also been made publicly available. Comment: Published in CVPR 201...|$|E
