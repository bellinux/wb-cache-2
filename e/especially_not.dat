5|$|With Justice Scalia {{breathing}} {{down the}} necks {{of anyone who}} peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports, {{the other members of}} the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs. It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically. No one likes an unnecessary fight, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E
5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa for Japan that same day but was forced to change his plans when Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force suddenly appeared to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> in matters which {{affected}} her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E

25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Sasanian Emperor, the Church of the East sought to increasingly distance itself from the Greek Orthodox Church (at the time being known as {{the church of the}} Eastern Roman Empire). Therefore, In 424, the bishops of the Sasanian Empire met in council under the leadership of Catholicos Dadishoʿ (421–456) and determined that they would not, henceforth, refer disciplinary or theological problems to any external power, and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> to any bishop or Church Council in the Roman Empire.|$|E

It took great effort to free the city from the snow and enable the Fasnacht to take place. Never before has a Fasnacht been celebrated with more snow, and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> fresh-fallen snow.

25|$|Before {{the fall}} of Communism in Poland in 1989, the main topics and {{sometimes}} even specific adventures of the comics were not chosen by Chmielewski himself, but rather by his publishers. He was <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> fond of {{the theme of the}} second book, where the protagonists learn about rules of the road. While his published wanted a comic that would be mainly educational, Chmielewski wanted to focus on humorous situations.

25|$|The {{transmission}} from swine {{to humans}} {{is believed to}} occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are {{in close contact with}} live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, <b>especially,</b> <b>not</b> wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.|$|E

After the 1948 parliamentary elections, when the communists dropped from the largest to the third largest party, Paasikivi refused to let them into the government; and the communists remained in opposition until 1966.|$|E

The criollos of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance {{for any kind}} of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her father never allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|E
25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda, {{economic}} development has lagged behind other parts of Querétaro and Mexico, in part to the end of mining in neighboring municipalities and in part to the ruggedness of the region's terrain. From the last decades of the 20th century to the present, the economic marginalization of the area has given the municipality one of the highest rates of emigration. Most migrants go to the United States, and the money they send back has now become the major income for Landa and {{the rest of}} the Sierra Gorda. However, the migration is dangerous. In March and April 2010, seventeen residents of the municipality disappeared while en route to the United States. Most are believed to have been kidnapped by armed men while their bus was in the state of Tamaulipas, taken to work in fields growing drugs. As of March 2011, the men have yet to be found, although four men were arrested in connection with the incident, for threatening the families of the victims. The incident has provoked the municipal government to advise residents not to go the United States, <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> through routes controlled by drug traffickers.|$|E
25|$|Duterte {{has said}} that he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor. After he was {{challenged}} by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Fr. Mark Falvey, SJ (d. 1975). The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of USD16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 and he was never charged with a crime. Additionally in May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid $100,000 settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Fr. Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao. When asked why he didn't complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time. He also stated that he never disclosed that information after he was expelled and moved to a different high school and <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> to his family.|$|E
25|$|Game Five old Munster rivals meet in Limerick, The Cork Admirals @ U.L Vikings {{is always}} a game Coach O' Sullivan has pencilled in his diary. Despite a dismal season {{last year for the}} Cork team they had bounced back this season rejuvenated, {{recording}} impressive victories, including a 26-0 win over the Rhino's, second seed in the north. The Vikings went to work on Cork scoring 34 points in the first half, a ten-yard rushing touch down by 2008 and 2009 shamrock bowl M.V.P Adrian Garvey and a spectacular 45 yard touch down pass by the Marc Ashworth / Sean Goldrick unit. The Admirals just could not get the ball moving <b>especially</b> <b>not</b> with the intense pressure coming from the Viking front 4, made up of Alan O' Carroll, Glen Carr, Kieran Coen and this year's d-line addition Ian Cahill who has fitted in comfortably with the three league veterans. Other scores included a 6-yard toss form Ashworth to Curtin and on Craig Switzers first ever offensive play he scored a 75-yard touchdown sweep on his rivals. The second half of the game was a struggle for both teams as it was littered with flags due to the Vikings indiscipline and a defensive stand from the Admirals they were able to control the Vikings and keep them scoreless in the second half, making the second half finish the same as the first 34-0, pushing the Vikings 5-0 record.|$|E
