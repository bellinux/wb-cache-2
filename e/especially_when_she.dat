She sees an old {{photograph}} of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras {{does not look}} disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs.

She has explained that the majority of models she encountered were from the southern islands or the north, so she learned slang from them.

25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} cover her face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Gable {{got along}} well with his co-stars during filming. Gable was great friends with actress Hattie McDaniel, {{and he even}} slipped her a real {{alcoholic}} drink during the scene {{in which they were}} supposed to be celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter. Gable tried to boycott the premiere of Gone with the Wind in Atlanta, Georgia, because the African American McDaniel was not permitted to attend.

25|$|Born in the East End at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Lou lived in Walford all her life. She {{was born into a}} large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, {{she fell in love with}} a local boy, Albert Beale (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, Maggie (Olivia Stanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock.

They had six more children: Harry (Aaron Mason), Ronnie (Chase Marks), Dora, Kenny (Michael Attwell), and twins Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline (Wendy Richard). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> disapproved of Pete's relationship with Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) because he had previously divorced his first wife, Pat (Pam St Clement), and she had banished her son Kenny to New Zealand in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then watched her grandchildren Michelle (Susan Tully), Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) grow up, with Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls.|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed review, Charles A. Hohman of PopMatters stated [...] "when <b>she's</b> infuriating, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she's</b> infuriating, she's an enthralling performer, her {{personality}} taking her where her limited vocals cannot." [...] He also commented Too often, she's treading water on songs that play like Alright outtakes, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> tries to expand, she stumbles. He remarked {{that she was}} stuck in her own world. However praise {{was given to the}} lyrics and melodies, with Hohman stating [...] "Yet she is more comedienne than philosopher, better at taking the piss than making a point." [...] Allisson Franks of Consequence of Sound wrote, [...] "Known for her upbeat melodies and rhymes, which are often comical, introspective and set to bouncy back beats, Allen decided to try something a little fresh on her next effort." ...|$|R

5000|$|Angela Young (voiced by Kath Soucie) - The {{only female}} human ever {{shown on the}} show. Angela is level-headed and smart, often the voice of reason to the more {{reckless}} male characters on the show. Much to Mike's dismay, she is also very good at video games (breaking another stereotype in the process) and once saved the world with her skills with a joystick. Angela is typically considered beautiful by other alien species, and has been kidnapped twice as a result. Both instances had her fighting her kidnapper, but being rescued by the Martians anyway. Not quite a tomboy, Angela will sometimes [...] "squeak" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> talks, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she's</b> excited.

500|$|Allison Mack plays Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark's best friends, {{who is in}} {{love with}} him (although her {{feelings}} are not reciprocated). Editor of the school newspaper, her journalistic curiosity and desire to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and [...] "know the truth" [...] create tension with her friends (<b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> investigates Clark's past). After learning about Smallville from casting director Dee Dee Bradley, Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan. The character was created just for the series, and was intended to have an [...] "ethnic background" [...] before Mack was hired. She has since appeared in the comic book.|$|E
500|$|Bridget Jones from New Idea {{stated that}} Naomi was [...] "sweet-at-heart". In August 2014, Inside Soap's Michael Cregan {{expressed}} {{his love for}} the character, commenting [...] "We love Neighbours Naomi and her flirty ways." [...] Cregan also thought the storyline involving Josh was [...] "saucy stuff". While Stephen Downie from TV Week quipped, [...] "The romance between Josh and Naomi has a use-by date but, much like the couple, we're willing to enjoy this ride while it lasts." [...] Claire Crick from All About Soap praised the couple, even though she thought they were complete opposites. Crick also loved their [...] "hilarious secret hook-ups". O'Reilly was concerned about how her character would be received by viewers, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> went after Toadie, but she {{was pleased with the}} positive reaction to Naomi.|$|E
500|$|Belldandy is {{exceptionally}} kind-hearted, {{even for}} a goddess. She can easily sense other people's emotions and tries her best to be empathetic to all those around her, displaying a combination of [...] "serene beauty and acceptance". She rarely holds a grudge and is always willing to forgive anyone who does injury to her...unless Keiichi is involved of course. Even though Belldandy tries her best to be as kind as possible, it is revealed that at times she can become very insecure and sad, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi {{in one way or}} another. This aspect of her character provides one of the biggest plot points in the Ah! My Goddess movie: Belldandy's possessiveness of Keiichi could make her an easy target for manipulation or even brainwashing, if the right buttons were pressed; her jealousy of Morgan Le Fay was what allowed Celestin, her teacher, to lure Belldandy into his plans.|$|E
50|$|With {{the runway}} repaired, the {{aeroplane}} lands at last. The engines {{have learned that}} teamwork runs a railway, not opposition about their differences.

500|$|Bessie's {{aggressive}} anti-Toryism {{was frequently}} in evidence {{during her first}} years in parliament, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> could attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Association, which she denounced as [...] "the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool", {{nothing more than a}} group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order to make profits for themselves. On 1May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that [...] "Mrs E.M. Braddock... danced a jig as she moved over to the Opposition benches where she occupied the seat usually used by Mr Churchill." [...] When the Bolton Evening News called her performance [...] "nauseating, a sorry degradation of democratic discussion" [...] she sued the newspaper for defamation. She lost the case, and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Mina's {{voice has}} {{distinctive}} timbre and great power. Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones. The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues, R and soul music {{during the late}} 1960s, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> worked {{in collaboration with the}} singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti. Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills, particularly [...] "Brava" [...] by Bruno Canfora (1965) and the pseudo-serial [...] "Se telefonando" [...] by Ennio Morricone (1966). The latter song was covered by several performers abroad. Shirley Bassey carried Mina's ballad [...] "Grande grande grande" [...] to charts in the U.S., U.K., and other English-speaking countries in 1973. Mina's easy listening duet [...] "Parole parole" [...] was turned into a worldwide hit by Dalida and Alain Delon in 1974. Mina gave up public appearances in 1978 but has continued to release popular albums on a yearly basis to the present day.|$|E

It is established that Chloe {{is the editor of}} the school newspaper the Torch at the start of the first season. Her journalistic curiosity—always wanting to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and [...] "know the truth"—causes tension with her friends, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> is digging into Clark's past in the season two episode [...] "Lineage". In the early seasons, Chloe hides the fact that she is in love with Clark, although the feeling is not reciprocated; she confesses her true feelings to Clark in season two's [...] "Fever" [...] while he is sick, but he calls out Lana Lang's name in his delirium. Her feelings for Clark get in the way of her better judgment as she betrays his trust in the season two finale, after witnessing him and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) sharing a kiss in his barn, and agrees to uncover information on Clark for Lionel Luthor (John Glover) in exchange for a job at the Daily Planet.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. IGN's wrote a mixed to favorable review for the song, stating that [...] "The title should {{say it all}} and reveal the ball of confusion that Pink really is. It's {{one of the most}} rockin' tunes on the whole album, but it's over-the-top arena pop rock, not ball crunching, barroom rawk." [...] Quentin Huff from PopMatters thought that [...] "Pink summons the spirits of the Go-Gos and Tiffany (“I Think We're Alone Now”)" [...] on the track. Todd Murphs from Stylus Magazine wrote a mixed review, saying that [...] "the ode to schizophrenia, “Leave Me Alone (I’m Lonely),” which may rely too much on the chorus, but at little over three minutes, it’s hardly a bother. <b>Especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she’s</b> dropping f-bombs left and right.|$|R
50|$|During her childhood, she {{sometimes}} showed a silent, childish religiousness. This could <b>especially</b> be seen <b>when</b> <b>she</b> prayed {{in front of}} self-erected altars surrounded by numerous candles or <b>when</b> <b>she</b> modeled Madonnas and drew images of saints per order of her sister.|$|R
500|$|Libby's group soon {{decides to}} leave and join the main group of survivors. But before their journey, Ana Lucia orders her and Michael to get some fruit ("...And Found").

Mr. Eko and Jin find Michael, leading him back to Libby and the group and {{allowing}} them to start their journey. During their trek in [...] "Abandoned", numerous tragedies occur, including the mysterious disappearance of Cindy {{and the death of}} Shannon (Maggie Grace). Once she joins the main camp, she and Hurley start to become romantically involved, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> tells him that she remembers when he stepped on her foot in the plane. Aside from Hurley, Libby also becomes friends with Claire (Emilie de Ravin), whom she helps in unlocking the memories of Claire's kidnapping in [...] "Maternity Leave". She also tries to help out with Bernard's S.O.S. but loses interest. In [...] "Dave", Libby helps Hurley solve his food addiction, but this fails when a food pallet coincidentally [...] "falls from the sky" [...] during a supply drop. Sensing something is wrong, she confronts him and eventually ends up on a cliff, where Hurley is about to jump. She tries to stop him, which leads to her professing her feelings for him.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E
2500|$|It's hard to play ditzy. ... The {{genius of}} Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, {{intelligent}} woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> yammers {{away on a}} first date with Alvy (Woody Allen) while the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.' Yo-yo? Hardly.|$|E
5000|$|In Flowers in the Attic, Corrine {{tells her}} {{children}} that Olivia was abused {{by her mother}} (she was locked in a closet, causing Olivia's claustrophobia and unwillingness {{to go into the}} attic), while in [...] "Shadows" [...] Olivia recounts a warm and loving relationship with a gentle mother, and goes into the attic several times, <b>especially</b> once <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has Alicia captive in there. [...] "Shadows" [...] does mention that Olivia's mother locked her in the closet as punishment <b>when</b> <b>she</b> misbehaved.|$|R

60|$|Clavering {{turned his}} head away, for he felt greatly {{inclined}} to laugh, but he knew the Torrance temper. Hetty had been very haughty during that drive, but she had not appeared <b>especially</b> dignified <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sat blinking about her in the snow, nor had Miss Schuyler, and he felt that they realized it; and in feminine fashion blamed him for being there. It was Miss Schuyler who relieved the situation.|$|R
