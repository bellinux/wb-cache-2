5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal.

Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficient,</b> {{and the rate of}} taxation often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E

To assist the General Assembly in writing more <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficient</b> legislation, Clements created the non-partisan Legislative Research Commission, stocked with professionals from various disciplines, to conduct governmental research. He created the Kentucky Agriculture and Industrial Board (the predecessor of the current Kentucky Department of Commerce), which attracted 250 new industries {{to the state and}} created 40,000 new jobs during its first three years. He also created the Kentucky Building Commission to manage and plan all new state buildings.

25|$|However, {{prior to}} the {{abolition}} of slavery, Cuba gained great prosperity from its sugar trade. Originally, the Spanish had ordered regulations on trade with Cuba, which kept the island from becoming a dominant sugar producer.

Nevertheless, Cuba's vast size and abundance of natural resources made it an ideal place for becoming a booming sugar producer. When Spain opened the Cuban trade ports, it quickly became a popular place. New technology allowed a much more <b>effective</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficient</b> means of producing sugar.
