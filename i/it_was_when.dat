Then in the week {{following the}} tornado the town decided to rebuild the school, {{and as a result}} most of Comfrey's businesses decided to follow suit. Ground was broken on the new school early the next year, and it opened to students on October 4, 1999. The population of Comfrey is down to 367 from the 425 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> the tornado hit.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens {{could not think of}} anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained with him {{for the rest of his}} time with the coastal forces.|$|E

50|$|The {{relation}} between a fox's wedding {{and the weather}} also differs by area, and in the Kumamoto Prefecture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> a rainbow appears, and in the Aichi Prefecture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> graupel falls {{that there is a}} fox's wedding.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> we {{have acted}} {{ourselves}}, and have seen others acting; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> we have laboured ourselves {{under the influence}} of our passions, and have seen others labouring; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> our great hopes have been attained or have <b>been</b> baulked; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when,</b> after having had the human heart revealed to us, we have the first opportunity to think; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then that the whole truth lights upon us; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then that we ask of ourselves whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> wise to endure such anxiety of mind, such agitation of spirit, such harrowing of the soul, to gain what may cease to interest to-morrow, or for which, at the best, a few years of enjoyment can alone <b>be</b> afforded; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then that we waken to the hollowness of all human things; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then that the sayings of sages and the warnings of prophets are explained and understood; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> then that we gain Experience.|$|R
5|$|Ste {{comes out}} to ex-girlfriend Amy first. During their {{conversation}} Ste reveales Amy was the only girl he really had feelings for and that his confusion over his sexuality was not the reason for him abusing her during their relation ship. Ste is very relieved by Amy's good reaction. Amy {{is the one who}} discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off, reminding him of how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he was hitting her.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Crescent is {{a row of}} 30 terraced houses {{laid out}} in a {{sweeping}} crescent in the city of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some changes have been made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone façade remains much as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> it was first built.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

5000|$|In McCosh's book Motive Powers, {{he notes}} that [...] "We may be angry and sin not; but this {{disposition}} may become sinful, and this in the highest degree. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> so <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> excessive, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> rage, and makes us lose control of ourselves. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> so, and may become a vice, when it leads us to wish evil {{to those who have}} offended us. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> resentment <b>when</b> <b>it</b> prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> vengeance <b>when</b> <b>it</b> impels us to crush those who have injured us. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> vindictiveness <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us.

25|$|Yates' {{words were}} to prove prophetic.
