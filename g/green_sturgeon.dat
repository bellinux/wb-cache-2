Observations were concentrated at San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin and delta sites (Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, Marin, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties). Historical 18th-century accounts report the aboriginal gillnetting and use of tule balsa watercraft for the capture of sturgeon, and fishing weirs were also likely employed on bay tidal flats (Gobalet et al. 2004). Most sturgeons were unidentified species but <b>green</b> <b>sturgeons</b> were specifically identified from Contra Costa and Marin County sites.

The lower temperature limit was not evident from the Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 study, although hatching rate decreased at 11 °C and hatched <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> embryos were shorter, compared to 14 °C. The mean total length of hatched <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> embryos decreased with increasing temperature, although their wet and dry weight remained relatively constant (Van Eenennaam et al. 2005). Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 concluded that temperatures 17-18 °C may be the upper limit of the thermal optima for <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> embryos.

The largest reported <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> weighed about 159 kg and was 2.1 m in length (USFWS 1993).

However, the survival of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> larvae is very high (93.3%) (Deng et al. 2002). Female <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> invest a greater amount of their reproductive resources into maternal yolk for nourishment of the embryo, which results in larger larvae (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Five-day-old <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> larvae have almost twice the weight of white sturgeon larvae (65 versus 34 milligrams (mg)) (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). This greater reserve of maternal yolk and larger larvae could provide an advantage in larval feeding and survival (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Compared with other acipenserids, <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> larvae appear more robust and easier to rear (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Juveniles continue to grow rapidly, reaching 300 mm in 1 year and over 600 mm within 2-3 years for the Klamath River (USFWS 1995). Juveniles spend from 1-4 years in fresh and estuarine waters and disperse into salt water at lengths of 300-750 mm (USFWS 1995).|$|E

On board Enterprise, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but the mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam, and together with Spock determines that Darnell died after all the salt was drained from his body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). They spread out to search, but Crater slips away. Kirk and McCoy find Sturgeon's body. Meanwhile, unseen by them, Nancy has killed Green; the faces of <b>Green</b> and <b>Sturgeon</b> show the same mottling as Darnell.

40|$|In {{order for}} a fish to grow and thrive, the gut must {{function}} efficiently. This is achieved through a range of processes, including controlled patterns of gut motility and modifications in gut blood flow. How these processes are affected by long and short-term changes in ambient temperature was {{the main focus of}} this thesis. After acclimation to a higher temperature, the interdigestive motility of rainbow trout was higher. This indicates an increased demand for movements involved in the housekeeping functions of the gut. Temperature acclimation did not affect the postprandial response, in neither gut blood flow nor gut motility. These results indicate that thermal compensation processes work to neutralize acute thermal effects, so that these two functions are maintained at a certain rate. Also, in vitro preparations of isolated intestine showed signs of thermal compensation processes, as the acute temperature effects on the response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol were abolished after a temperature acclimation period. Fish species studied responded very differently to an acute change in temperature. A relatively linear correlation with temperature was seen in, both gut blood flow and gut motility, in two species of sculpins (shorthorn and Arctic sculpin). The gut blood flow, in both <b>green</b> and white <b>sturgeon,</b> was unaffected by moderate fluctuations in water temperature during the interdigestive state. White sturgeon were also studied after feeding and a correlation between gut blood flow and temperature was observed, in a similar fashion as for the unfed sculpins. Thermoregulatory behaviours observed in white sturgeon, show that moving between different temperatures, after a meal, will have a great influence on the volume of blood distributed to the gut. An increase in gut blood flow is probably an important factor explaining why it can be beneficial to migrate into warmer waters after feeding. However, if combining the presented data with data from previous studies, it shows that perfusion of the gut can also be a limiting factor when the environmental temperature changes. This is probably the reason why some fish species forage in warm waters and then move into colder areas when digesting the meal. A leading hypothesis suggests that the temperature limitations for a fish are mainly set by a reduction in metabolic scope. However, experimental data has shown that temperature can have significant effects on both appetite and growth before metabolic scope is reduced. The findings in this thesis suggest that oxygen-limited thermal tolerance in the gut of fish could also be a significant variable in determining the temperature range that fish can tolerate...|$|R
40|$|Finfish are {{consumed}} across the United States and constitute {{an important part}} of the American diet. However, seafood consumption can be a tenuous topic, with supporters highlighting the health benefits of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3) and opponents emphasizing the neurotoxicity of methylmercury. Because all fish contain varying amounts of EPA, DHA, and methylmercury, the need for clear and unbiased information is essential to alleviate the confusion experienced by many consumers and empower them to make informed decisions regarding seafood consumption. As the market changes and more fish originate from aquaculture sources, where diets are controlled, consumer intakes of EPA, DHA, and methylmercury are changing. Thus, the goal of this project was to examine fatty acid and methylmercury content in 77 commercially available finfish species commonly consumed across the U. S. ^ EPA and DHA are important for the development of neurological function and eyesight in fetuses and infants, as well as heart health and the retention of cognitive abilities in aging populations. In accordance with these benefits, fatty acid profiles were determined for all collected species. EPA plus DHA content varied widely both within and between species. The fatty acid profiles of farmed species differed markedly from those of wild-caught species. Farmed species, including channel catfish, salmon (Atlantic and Chinook), and <b>sturgeon</b> (<b>green</b> and white), exhibited high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and n- 6 fatty acids. These differences stem from the lower costs associated with incorporating these fatty acids into farm-fed diets as compared to EPA and DHA. Some farmed species (rainbow trout, salmon, and sturgeon) were found to contain high levels of EPA and DHA, though the ratio of EPA plus DHA to other fatty acids was generally lower in farmed species than wild-caught species. ^ In contrast to the health benefits offered by EPA and DHA, methylmercury exposure may adversely affect neurological development. For most adults consuming moderate amounts of fish, methylmercury is not a significant health hazard. Fetuses and developing infants, however, are considerably more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of methymercury. Therefore, pregnant and nursing women should exercise caution when consuming seafood. The second half of this project examined the mercury content of all finfish collected. Total mercury content was low in most species, including salmon, Alaskan pollock, Atlantic cod, tilapia, channel catfish, and pangasius/swai, which are among the top ten species consumed in the U. S. Total mercury content was also low in all farmed species studied, though wide variations were still observed within and between species. In order to keep blood mercury levels below the USEPA RfD of 0. 1 μg/kg bw-day, 27 species examined in this study should be avoided by sensitive populations. In addition, swordfish (1107 ppb) and king mackerel (1425 ppb) contained mercury levels above the FDA Action Level of 1000 ppb, meaning that consumers are not being adequately protected from high mercury species entering the marketplace. ...|$|R

Green and white sturgeon enter the Feather River system annually and spawning of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> was documented for the first time in 2011(Seesholtz et al. 2014). No current use by sturgeon of Sacramento River tributaries, other than the Feather River system, has been reported (Beamesderfer et al. 2004, Moyle 2002).

50|$|The {{ecology and}} life history of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> have {{received}} little study, evidently {{because of the}} generally low abundance, limited spawning distribution, and low commercial and sport fishing value of the species (Moyle 2002). <b>Green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is the most marine species of sturgeon, coming into rivers mainly to spawn (Moyle 2002).

50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} member of the sturgeon family Acipenseridae, and {{is also the most}} marine-oriented of the sturgeon species. <b>Green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are known to range in nearshore marine waters from Mexico to the Bering Sea, with a general tendency to head North after their out-migration from freshwater (NMFS 2005). They are commonly observed in bays and estuaries along the western coast of North America, with particularly large concentrations entering the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor during the late summer (Moyle 2002, NMFS 2005). While there is some bias associated with recovery of tagged fish through commercial fishing, the pattern of a northern migration is supported by the large concentration of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> in the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor, which peaks in August (NMFS 2005).|$|E

50|$|A {{conceptual}} model of early behavior and migration of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> early life intervals {{based on the}} Kynard et al. 2005 study follows: Females deposit eggs at sites with large rocks and moderate or eddy water flow that keeps the large, dense, poorly adhesive eggs from drifting, so eggs sink deep within the rocks. CH2M Hill (2002) assumed that hatchling <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> embryos drift downstream like hatchling white sturgeon embryos. This was incorrect. Hatchling <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> embryos seek nearby cover, and remain under rocks, unlike white sturgeon which drift downstream as embryos (i.e. newly hatched <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> do not exhibit pelagic behavior like newly hatched white sturgeon) (Deng et al. 2002). After about 9 days fish develop into larvae and initiate exogenous foraging up- and downstream on the bottom (they do not swim up into the water column, unlike white sturgeon). After a day or so, larvae initiate a downstream dispersion migration that lasts about 12 days (peak, 5 days). At the age of ten days, when exogenous foraging begins, green sturgeons are 19 to 29 mm in length (mean 24 mm) (Deng et al. 2002). At the age of 15 to 21 days, <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are 30 mm or greater in length (Deng et al. 2002). At the age of 45 days, metamorphosis is complete and <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are 70 to 80 mm in length (Deng et al. 2002). All migration and foraging during the migration period is nocturnal, unlike white sturgeon. During the first 10 months of life, <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are the most nocturnal of any North American sturgeon yet studied, {{and this was the}} case for all life intervals during any activity (migration, foraging, or wintering). Post-migrant larvae are benthic, foraging up- and downstream diurnally with a nocturnal activity peak. Foraging larvae select open habitat, not structure habitat, but continue to use cover in the day. When larvae develop into juveniles, there is no change in response to bright habitat, and no preference or avoidance of bright habitat. In the fall, juveniles migrate downstream mostly at night to wintering sites, ceasing migration at 7-8 °C. During winter, juveniles select low light habitat, likely deep pools with some rock structure. Wintering juveniles forage actively at night between dusk and dawn and are inactive during the day, seeking the darkest available habitat.|$|E

Most tags for Southern DPS <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> tagged in the San Francisco Estuary have been returned from outside that estuary (Moyle 2002).

50|$|Northern DPS <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> migrate up the Klamath River between late February {{and late}} July (Moyle 2002). The {{spawning}} period is March-July, with a peak from mid-April to mid-June (Moyle 2002). Spawning {{takes place in}} deep, fast water (Moyle 2002). Preferred spawning substrate is likely large cobble, but it can range from clean sand to bedrock (Moyle 2002). Eggs are broadcast and externally fertilized in relatively fast water and probably in depths greater than 3 m (Moyle 2002). Female <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> produce 59,000-242,000 eggs, about 4.34 millimeters (mm) in diameter (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001 and 2006).|$|E

The scutes also tend to be sharper and more pointed than in white sturgeon. The dorsal fin has 33-36 rays, the anal fin, 22-28. The body colour of the white sturgeon is yellow with some pink instead of the green of the <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sturgeons {{have adopted}} a {{temporal}} strategy to controlling risks. Sturgeons live a long time, delay maturation to large sizes, and spawn multiple times over their lifespan. The sturgeon’s long life span and repeat spawning in multiple years allows them to outlast periodic droughts and environmental catastrophes. The high fecundity that comes with large size allows them to produce large numbers of offspring when suitable spawning conditions occur and {{to make up for}} years of poor conditions. Adult <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> do not spawn every year and {{only a fraction of the}} population enters freshwater where they might be at risk of a catastrophic event in any year. The widespread ocean distribution of <b>green</b> <b>sturgeon</b> ensures that most of the population at any given time is dispersed among areas where they are not vulnerable to catastrophic losses.|$|E
