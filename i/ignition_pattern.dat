30|$|At {{all five}} sites, we {{established}} {{five to ten}} transects that were either 5 m or 10 m apart, depending upon {{size and shape of}} the burn unit. We collected plant community and fire severity data in 1 m 2 quadrats placed every 10 m along each transect. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, there were 50 quadrats per burn unit; at Mima Mounds, Scatter Creek, and West Rocky, there were 100 quadrats per burn unit. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, where <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> treatments were applied, there were 21 to 29 quadrats per <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> treatment (sample size was dependent upon where ignition lines met within the burn unit), so sample size between ignition patterns and sites varied slightly. Due {{to the fact that we}} could not replicate <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> treatments within each burn, <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> data are pseudo-replicated within a site (Hurlbert 1984, but see Oksanen 2003 for a rebuttal). Despite this design challenge, we still believe that these data provide a unique opportunity to evaluate fire behavior, severity, and effects associated with fire ignition patterns.|$|E
30|$|In the prairies of the Pacific Northwest, USA, {{fire has}} been reintroduced {{as a tool}} for {{reducing}} non-native, invasive plant cover and promoting the growth and establishment of native plant communities. Head fires and backing fires are the two primary <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> used to complete most prescribed burns, but the relative effectiveness of these two methods on invasive plant control and native enhancement is unknown. A clear understanding of the relationship between fire behavior, fire severity, and fire effects on vegetation and how these metrics are affected by fire <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> could help managers fine tune burn prescriptions to better achieve ecological objectives. We used observations from five prescribed burns in the south Puget Sound prairies of western Washington, USA, to evaluate the relationship between intensity, severity, and effects. Additionally, we collected data from two burns on how <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> affected these relationships. We found a significant positive correlation between maximum surface temperature and fire severity, and a decline in perennial taxa with increasing fire severity. We also found that surface temperatures did not differ between <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns,</b> but a greater area burned at moderate severity in backing fires than in head fires. <b>Ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> differentiated plant communities by changing the number of species present within different life form categories. However, this response was contingent upon site history and pre-burn conditions. Native perennial forbs were associated with head fires in a site with high pre-existing native plant species richness. Native and exotic forbs were associated with backing fires at a site with low pre-existing native plant species richness. Thus, managers may want to consider <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> when planning burn prescriptions in order to achieve particular ecological objectives.|$|R

40|$|Engine <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> can be {{analyzed}} to identify the engine fault according to both the specific prior domain knowledge and the shape features of the patterns. One of the challenges in ignition system diagnosis is {{that more than one}} fault may appear at a time. This kind of problem refers to simultaneous-fault diagnosis. Another challenge is the acquisition of a large amount of costly simultaneous-fault <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> for constructing the diagnostic system because the number of the training patterns depends on the combination of different single faults. The above problems could be resolved by the proposed framework combining feature extraction, probabilistic classification, and decision threshold optimization. With the proposed framework, the features of the single faults in a simultaneous-fault pattern are extracted and then detected using a new probabilistic classifier, namely, pairwise coupling relevance vector machine, which is trained with single-fault patterns only. Therefore, the training dataset of simultaneous-fault patterns is not necessary. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well for both single-fault and simultaneous-fault diagnoses and is superior to the existing approach...|$|R

30|$|While several {{different}} ignition patterns {{are used to}} affect fire behavior (Johansen 1987), these strategies remain largely unexplored in the fire and restoration literature. Our study suggests that fire <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> influences fire severity and post-fire vegetation in Pacific Northwest prairies. Although average maximum surface temperature did not vary between the two <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> treatments, a 10 -fold difference in residence time suggests that the duration of heating {{may be an important}} factor influencing vegetation response to ignition patterns. This reflects a fundamental difference between the behavior of head and backing fires: head fires spread rapidly among the tops of the grasses, spending less time on the surface, quickly influencing large acreages; backing fires have longer residence times, allowing more thorough combustion of plant material, typically over smaller areas (Keeley 2009). This pattern aligns well with our finding at Glacial Heritage that backing fires were more severe compared to head fires.|$|E

Each corner of the fuelbed was ignited with a lighter in quick succession. This <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> was designed to allow a uniform burning pattern from each side and minimize spatial variation in fire behavior (i.e., generating equal heat flux to all sample compartments).|$|E
30|$|When extrapolating {{information}} presented in {{late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century reports and datasets to pre-settlement forests, it is important to understand that changes in <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns,</b> and extensive mining, logging, and grazing had already begun to transform the conifer forests of California when these data were collected and reports written. Lightning <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> likely did not substantially change between pre-settlement times and the early twentieth century, but human <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> undoubtedly did. The occurrence of lightning strikes decreases from east to west, and is low in the western foothills and lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada where Native American populations were densest (Cook 1978, van Wagtendonk and Cayan 2008). There is disagreement among researchers as to the extent of the impact of Native American ignitions on the Sierra Nevada landscape (Parker 2003), but the high pre-Euro-American settlement fire frequencies seen in oak woodlands and lower elevation conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada were likely due in part to Native American practice. In at least some locations, there is evidence that ignitions by Native Americans associated with foraging practices played a role in reducing surface fuels and thinning lower to middle elevation mixed conifer and pine forests (Reynolds 1959, Anderson 2005, Morgan 2008). Historical accounts indicate that many fires ignited by Native Americans were ignited in the fall when negative impacts to food resources would be minimized (Anderson 2005, Morgan 2008). In contrast, most human ignited fires during the early part of the twentieth century occurred in July and August when there is a higher risk of escaping control and extreme fire behavior (Show and Kotok 1923). Ignitions by Native Americans had largely been eliminated by the mid 1800 s as the Native American population had been reduced by > 80 % by 1855, and most of the remaining population removed to reservations (Cook 1978, Kilgore and Taylor 1979, Dutschke 1988).|$|R
30|$|By default, {{scholars}} {{have assumed that}} unauthorized fires are set {{with the intention of}} spread, but without any measures of control for size or severity of the resulting fire. This assumption characterizes the behavior as reckless, ecologically destructive, and sociopathic. However, if firesetters wish to achieve particular social or biophysical goals with the use of fire, malicious or otherwise, the decision of when and where to start a fire implies considerable knowledge of ecological cause and effect (Lewis 1978). For example, fuel moisture, which varies considerably through time and space, presents a significant factor controlling fire spread and severity (Anderson 1982, Rothermel 1983). As a consequence, the most efficient way for humans to control fire concerns the manipulation of the timing and placement of ignitions (Granstrom and Niklasson 2008). Thus, if each ignition represents the outcome of a specific decision to burn at a particular time and place, spatiotemporal <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> indicate firesetter preferences for conditions conducive to desired fire intensity, spread, containment, and biophysical effects on the landscape. Where ignitions are more arbitrary with respect to spatiotemporal patterning, firesetters may lack either sufficient ecological understanding or interest in the biophysical consequences of fire. The identification of spatiotemporal <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> can provide more nuanced understandings of unauthorized fires and can help to clarify the actual social and ecological dynamics associated with this type of disturbance.|$|R
40|$|Through its {{influence}} on biomass production, climate controls fuel availability affecting {{at the same time}} fuel moisture and flammability, which are the main determinants for fire ignition and propagation.

The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify, at coarse scale, the role of the vegetation seasonal dynamics on fire <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> of the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni (southern Italy) during 2000 - 2013. We applied a habitat suitability model to compare the multitemporal NDVI profiles at the locations of fire occurrence (the used habitat) with the NDVI profiles of the entire study area (the available habitat). Results demonstrated that, from May to October, wildfires occur preferentially at sites where the remotely-sensed NDVI observations have on average lower values than the available habitat. On the other hand, in the period November-April, wildfires tend to occur at sites where the corresponding NDVI observations have higher values than the available habitat. From a practical viewpoint, the proposed method can be implemented using many different ecogeographical variables simultaneously, thus integrating remotely sensed imagery with socioeconomic data, land cover, physiography or any landscape features that are thought to influence fire occurrence in the study area...|$|R

Despite this burning pattern, ROS measurements for this plot were the highest compared to ROS measurements from all other plots, probably because of a ring-fire <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> that was used to ignite the entire unit at once.|$|E
30|$|Even {{in light}} of our caveats, when our data were {{partitioned}} by <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern,</b> novel interactions became evident and the heterogeneity of fire and vegetation response could be partially explained by ignition patterns. Since there is a paucity of published studies investigating how ignition patterns interact with fire severity to shape post-fire plant communities (Bidwell et al. 1990), we hope that this paper will promote further inquiry into how fire ignition patterns can influence post-fire community response. Species richness within key plant life forms provided one important, though coarse, look at how different types of fire influence the trajectory of community recovery. Future work should assess how <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> and severity interact with plant life form cover, individual species responses, and specific life history stages. The ability of individual species to survive or germinate post fire is fundamental to community organization post disturbance, and assessing the influence of ignition patterns will likely become increasingly useful to future restoration efforts and invasive species management. If similar findings are repeatable and consistent across multiple burns and prairies, this will not only provide a relatively novel way of interpreting vegetation response, but also allow for land managers to more precisely make fire prescriptions to achieve desired restoration outcomes.|$|E
30|$|Indicator species {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} plant life form response to ignition patterns was variable and inconsistent {{between the two}} sites. At Glacial Heritage, only native perennial forbs (NPF) were strongly associated with head fires and no plant life forms {{were significantly associated with}} backing fires, in line with patterns observed with ordinations (Table 3). At Tenalquot, native perennial forbs (NPF), exotic perennial forbs (EPF), and exotic annual forbs (EAF) were strong indicators of backing fire and no plant life forms were significantly associated with head fires. Exotic and native grasses were not associated with either <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> at either site (Table 3).|$|E
30|$|Spatial {{autocorrelation}} in {{fire behavior}} also {{has important implications}} for management. Burn patchiness is often a stated goal of management burns. Spatial analysis provides a useful way to quantify this characteristic and can help to elucidate what scale and strength of patchiness is desirable for different community types and different management goals. For example, do prescribed fires, conducted under optimum weather conditions and systematically ignited, mimic the variability characteristic of natural fires? Managers could incorporate the appropriate spatial heterogeneity in their management burns by manipulating fuel treatments, <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns,</b> or burning conditions. More studies of fire patchiness and its controls should be conducted in other fuel types, comparing different firing techniques (e.g., back vs. head fires), and under different burning conditions (prescribed fires vs. wildfires).|$|R

Yet it should be noted that modeled flame lengths were approximately 50 % of observed estimates using NFFL 4 and were much lower in the other fuel models. The HREC 5 fire had relatively large ROS and flame lengths when compared to all model outputs (Figure 2). As with most burns, variable wind direction and speed (Table 1 and 2) coupled with <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> may influence fire behavior by preheating fuels, which confounds estimates.

Fire-fire interactions occur naturally when spot fires start ahead of the main fire and when separate fire events converge in one location. Interactions can be created intentionally during prescribed fires by using spatial <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns.</b> Mass fires are among the most extreme examples of interactive behavior. This paper presents a review of the detailed effects of fire-fire interaction in terms of merging or coalescence criteria, burning rates, flame dimensions, flame temperature, indraft velocity, pulsation, and convection column dynamics.

30|$|Two of the sites, Glacial Heritage Preserve and Tenalquot Preserve, {{were studied}} more closely for <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> {{treatment}} effects on fire intensity, fire severity, and vegetation communities. The 12.2 ha unit at Glacial Heritage was burned in August 2011, marking the third fire in 10 years at that location. The 8.1 ha, August 2012 fire at Tenalquot {{was the first}} known fire to occur since European settlement of the area. Approximately half of each burn unit experienced a head fire and half experienced a backing fire. Prior to both burns, sites were boom-sprayed with a grass-specific herbicide (sethoxydim) in the spring to kill non-native grasses and then sprayed with a broad-spectrum herbicide (glyphosate) during the fall post-fire flush to kill fast-growing non-native forbs. This integrated treatment of fire and herbicide {{has been the most}} successful management strategy to control invasive species and prepare sites for seed augmentation (Stanley et al. 2008). Areas were then seeded with Roemer’s fescue (Festuca roemeri [Pavlick] E.B. Alexeev) two months post fire. Despite findings of deleterious effects of certain broadleaf herbicides on seed germination of both monocots and dicots in dry grasslands (Wagner and Nelson 2014), we have not seen any evidence of pre-emergent, off-target effects of grass-specific (A. Lincoln, Center for Natural Lands Management, Olympia, Washington, USA, unpublished data) or broad-spectrum (Stanley et al. 2008) herbicides on prairie species when they are applied at appropriate times.

Results from field studies indicated that spatial patterns of duff characteristics occurred, and they were then modeled by kriging, simulation and a trend-surface modeling techniques. The higher elevations of the study unit burned more severely than the lower portion. This is believed to be due to the heat generated by the fire drying out the upper portions of the units, thus consuming more duff material and thinner pre-burn duff thickness due to ground-based harvesting tech-niques. Attempts to predict duff consumption and subsequent post-burn duff thickness were successful using a trend-surface model developed for this site and a general duff con-sumption model.

30|$|Prescribed fire, or {{ecological}} burning, is {{a primary}} tool used for fuel reduction and restoration in ecosystems throughout the world (Agee 1996, Covington 2003, Brown et al. 2004, Pyke et al. 2010, Ryan et al. 2013). Prescribed fire is typically applied within specific windows of wind speed and direction, relative humidity, and temperature to minimize risk of escape and limit smoke emissions. Additionally, the fire <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> used during a prescribed fire operation depend on topography, available resources (trained personnel, engines, etc.), surrounding vegetation, and relationship to the wildland-urban interface. While fire behavior is complex, strong relationships have been found between certain metrics of fire intensity and fire severity, and fire severity and habitat structure in shrublands and forests (Keeley 2009). In these systems, surface temperatures and duration of heating (fire intensity metrics) are positively correlated with surface duff consumption, a measure of fire severity (Hartford and Frandsen 1992). Also, the degree of biomass loss, either aboveground or belowground, influences the post-burn vegetation community recovery trajectory in forests (Turner et al. 1999, Schoennagel et al. 2004, Perry et al. 2011, Ryan et al. 2013).

Detailed maps of simulated fire likelihood, fire intensity and fire size were used to assess spatial patterns of HVRA exposure to fire and to analyze large fire initiation and spread through source-sink ratio and fire potential index. Crown fire activity was estimated and used to identify potential spotting-emission hazardous stands. The results revealed considerable variation in fire risk causative factors among and within HVRAs.

30|$|Ignition {{patterns}} caused community level {{shifts in}} plant life forms, although shifts were not consistent between burns. These variable responses were likely driven by different site histories. The burn unit at Glacial Heritage consisted of remnant native prairie with high native plant richness, low moss depth, {{and a history}} of multiple burns in the past decade. This created an initial heterogeneous plant community with low aboveground fuels, which possibly explains the different community trajectories between ignition patterns. The ecological objective for the burn was to remove standing dead litter and maintain current vegetative composition. At Tenalquot, the burn was the first in that section of prairie in recorded history, and the site itself is a degraded horse pasture with low remnant native plant richness, high pasture grass cover, and high moss depth and cover. The ecological objective at Tenalquot was to remove dead litter and moss and prepare the site for native enhancement. The lower overall severity of the fire and the lack of strong differences in severity between ignition patterns likely caused the whole plant community to shift in similar ways. Thus, these initial starting conditions could have facilitated the resulting responses to the two <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> treatments.|$|E

The aim of this work is to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of wildfires hotspots in Sardinia (Italy) during 2000 – 2013 and to relate their dynamics with remotely-sensed NDVI-based fuel phenology patterns. We considered eleven bi-weekly time frames (TFs) and used kernel density (KD) estimation to spatialize the corresponding fire ignitions. Then, to identify zones of fire occurrence concentration, we performed a quartile classification of the KD values for each TF considered. Finally, we analyzed the spatio-temporal association between the ignitions hotspots and the remotely-sensed fuel phenology patterns by means of a correspondence analysis and a selectivity ratio. We found that wildfires hotspots are strictly related to anthropogenic pressure and to the spatio-temporal variation of fuel conditions in terms of both load and moisture: areas with less fires concentration proved to be mainly associated to coarse fuels with low seasonal NDVI variability; to the contrary, the fire hotspots resulted strictly correlated to fine fuels with high seasonal NDVI variability. Understanding the association between the seasonal distribution of wildfires hotspots and fuel phenology may allow the projection of fire <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> to future, especially under changing climatic scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The {{rate and}} {{magnitude}} of emissions from prescribed burns and wildfires in wildland areas throughout the world are related to biomass consumption, which is controlled by total biomass, fuel moisture, fuel distribution (fuel size and arrangement), and <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern.</b> Consequently, land-use practices, which can affect many of these components, {{play a crucial role}} in determining the rate {{and magnitude of}} smoke production from biomass burning.

30|$|Ignition {{patterns}} {{could influence}} fire intensity, severity, and vegetation response to fire {{for a number}} of reasons. First, backing fires and head fires create fundamentally different types of fire. Head fires are flashy, wind-driven fires with short residence times, high rates of spread, and longer flame lengths. Backing fires are primarily fuel-driven fires, with long residence times, low rates of spread, and shorter flame lengths. These differences could have specific first- and second-order impacts on community response. In grasslands, fire intensity (as measured by maximum surface temperatures) and severity (as measured by organic matter removed) are likely to be higher in backing fires than in head fires. Variation in maximum temperatures and heating time {{as a result of the}} <b>ignition</b> <b>pattern</b> could have direct impacts on plant tissue death and indirect impacts on seed germination the following season. These impacts may differ based on plant life form and origin; perennials with buds less than 2 cm belowground are much more susceptible to direct fire impacts than annuals with a sufficient seed bank or long-lived woody species with insulating bark (Pyke et al. 2010). Additionally, fire-adapted native plant species may be more resistant to longer duration or higher temperature fires that are required to remove introduced species (DiTomaso et al. 2006), providing an opportunity to utilize certain ignition patterns for invasive control. For these reasons, managers may use different ignition patterns during a prescribed burn to influence fire behavior, severity, and community response (Kilgore and Curtis 1987, Van Wilgen et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the spatiotemporal changes in wildfire regime and exposure in a fire-prone Mediterranean area (Sardinia, Italy) {{in relation to}} changes in <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns,</b> weather, suppression activities, and land uses. We also used wildfire simulations to identify fine-scale changes in wildfire exposure of important features on the island. Sardinia experienced a sharp reduction in fire number and area burned between the periods 1980 – 1994 and 1995 – 2009. Despite this decrease, losses and fatalities from wildfires continue. This suggests that localized areas and seasons of high wildfire risk persist on the island. Our analysis showed (1) a reduction in area burned (60, 000 – 20, 000 ha/year) and ignitions (3, 700 – 2, 600 fires/year), (2) an advance of 15 days for the fire season peak, (3) an increase in spring temperatures, and (4) an increase in fire exposure for WUI areas. Little change was noted for land use types and associated fuels. Most likely the reduction in fire activity {{may be due to}} a combination of social factors and suppression capabilities. On the other hand, simulation modeling suggested pockets of high wildfire exposure in specific places. The combined empirical analyses and simulation modeling provided a robust approach to understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfire risk on the island...|$|R
40|$|A 20 L {{ignition}} test chamber {{has been used}} to test suspensions of 7 UK and world traded coals in air and O 2 /CO 2 mixtures typical of oxy-combustion conditions. The coals varied in rank from sub-bituminous to bituminous and were tested in varying concentrations from the ignition limit to 400 g/m 3. Following each successful test the combustion residue was collected, weighed and analysed within a thermogravimetric analyser, allowing Q factors to be estimated. The ignition limit varied slightly in air, but was mostly around the 200 g/m 3 level. With the exception of Coal C, which was much harder to ignite, it correlated roughly with coal rank. The ignition limit changed significantly with O 2 concentration when in mixed O 2 /CO 2 gases. Only a few high volatile coals ignited in 21 % O 2 /CO 2 v/v, and then only with a 2500 J, rather than a 1000 J, igniter. An increase in O 2 /CO 2 levels to 30 or 35 % gave <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> similar to those carried out in air with a further increase to 40 % having little additional effect. In addition the minimum ignition concentration decreased with increase in O 2. Heterogeneous combustion or gasification of the coal by CO 2 appears to be confirmed by comparing weight loss results for air and O 2 /CO 2 mixtures respectively for an equivalent peak pressure rise...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Humans {{influence}} {{the frequency and}} spatial pattern of fire and contribute to altered fire regimes, but fuel loading is often the only factor considered when planning management activities to reduce fire hazard. Understanding both the human and biophysical landscape characteristics that explain how fire patterns vary should help to identify where fire {{is most likely to}} threaten values at risk. We used human and biophysical explanatory variables to model and map the spatial patterns of both fire ignitions and fire frequency in the Santa Monica Mountains, a human-dominated southern California landscape. Most fires in the study area are caused by humans, and our results showed that fire <b>ignition</b> <b>patterns</b> were strongly influenced by human variables. In particular, ignitions were most likely to occur close to roads, trails, and housing development but were also related to vegetation type. In contrast, biophysical variables related to climate and terrain (January temperature, transformed aspect, elevation, and slope) explained most of the variation in fire frequency. Although most ignitions occur close to human infrastructure, fires were more likely to spread when located farther from urban development. How far fires spread was ultimately related to biophysical variables, and the largest fires in southern California occurred as a function of wind speed, topography, and vegetation type. Overlaying predictive maps of fire ignitions and fire frequency may be useful for identifying high-risk areas that can be targeted for fire management actions...|$|R
