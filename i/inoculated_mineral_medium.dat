40|$|Upland {{soils are}} a {{significant}} sink of atmospheric methane, but the organisms responsible for methane consumption {{have yet to be}} identified. The ecology of methanotrophs was investigated in a beech forest soil which exhibited atmospheric-methane-uptake. Maximal methane-oxidation was observed in the upper mineral layer between the organic and inorganic horizons at a rate of 3. 1 +/- 0. 3 nmoles CH 4 g [fresh wt soil]- 1 d- 1. A clone bank of the methanotroph pmoA gene was constructed by PCR amplification from soil DNA extracts. The PCR primers used coamplify the related amoA gene of ammonia-oxidizers. The clones recovered grouped into three clusters: Nitrosospira-like sequences, a group somewhat related to alpha-Proteobacteria methanotrophs and previously referred to as the RA 14 group, and a cluster which could not be characterized as either amoA or pmoA sequences. No pmoA genes closely related to genera of cultured methanotrophs were obtained. The 16 S rDNA was also targeted using eubacterial and methanotroph-specific primers. 16 S rDNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of organisms distantly related to known methanotrophs. Methanotroph enrichment cultures were established by <b>inoculating</b> <b>mineral</b> salts <b>medium</b> with soil and incubating under an atmosphere of 10 % methane in air. Gene sequencing from the enrichments indicated the presence of organisms belonging to the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis. The results suggest that the dominant methanotrophs in the forest soil are not related to known organisms and do not grow under conditions typically used to isolate methanotrophs...|$|R
40|$|Perchloroethene, Trichloroethene, {{and other}} {{chlorinated}} solvents are widespread groundwater pollutants. They form Dense Non Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) that sink through permeable groundwater aquifers until non-permeable zone is reached. In Italy {{there are many}} situations of serious contamination of groundwater that might compromise their use in industry, agriculture, private, as the critical case of a Central Italy valley located {{in the province of}} Teramo (Val Vibrata), characterized by a significant chlorinated solvents contamination. Data from the various monitoring campaigns that have taken place over time were collected, and new samplings were carried out, resulting in a complete database. The data matrix was processed with a multivariate statistic analysis (in particular Principal Components Analysis, PCA) and was then imported into Geographic Information System (GIS), to obtain a model of the contamination. A microcosm anaerobic study was utilized to assess the potential for in situ natural or enhanced bioremediation. Most of the microcosms were positive for dechlorination, particularly those <b>inoculated</b> with a <b>mineral</b> <b>medium.</b> This indicate the presence of an active native dechlorinating population in the subsurface, probably inhibited by co-contaminants in the groundwater, or more likely by the absence or lack of nutritional factors.

The degradation {{occurred in}} microcosms containing gasoline-contaminated subsurface sediment from Seal Beach, California, and anaerobic, sulfide-reduced defined <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> supplemented with 20 mM sulfate. Benzene, at initial concentrations ranging from 40 to 200 microM, was depleted in all microcosms {{and more than}} 90 % of 14 C-labeled benzene was mineralized to 14 CO 2...|$|R
40|$|Thermotoga neapolitana is a hyperthermophilic {{bacterium}} that branches {{very early}} from the Bacterial lineage, suggesting {{that some of}} its features may be ancestral to all bacteria. Physiological studies in this ecologically and evolutionarily intriguing organism would be facilitated by development of a gene transfer system. ^ Uniform growth and high plating efficiencies of T. neapolitana were achieved using a <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> {{with the addition of}} 0. 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} parameters {{on the growth}} and the tyrosine phenol-lyase content of Erwinia herbicola was investigated. On <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> containing glycerol, l-tyrosine increased the enzyme content 23 -fold. When the l-tyrosine was also the carbon source, bacterial growth was 300 {{times greater than the}} basal level. On a rich medium, tyrosine phenol-lyase production was strongly dependent on pH and aeration. Catabolite repression and induction both probably control enzyme content...|$|R
30|$|Freshwater lake {{sediment}} (60  mL), {{paddy soil}} (450  mL) and methanogenic sludge (400  mL) {{from a local}} wastewater treatment plant in Chongqing, China were sampled and mixed. To remove solid impurities and organic matters, the mixture was precipitated and sieved (10 mesh), followed with cleaned (NaCl solution 0.9 %) and flushed (nitrogen gas 99.99 %) for three times. The pretreated mixture was then diluted with <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> and trace element solution to obtain a 3  L homogeneous slurry. This slurry was finally divided into two parts and inoculated into two reactors (named A and B) for the enrichment of damo microorganism. The composition of the <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> and trace element solutions was prepared based on the formula described by Ettwig et al. (2009). During the preparation, dissolved oxygen (DO) remained below the detection limit to keep anaerobic condition by flushing with nitrogen gas (99.99 %). In the batch test coupled with anammox, anammox bacteria (100  mL, SS[*]=[*] 1.65  g/L, VSS[*]=[*] 0.77  g/L) derived from the anammox bioreactor in a previous study (Yao et al. 2015) was inoculated into reactor B.|$|R
40|$|Twenty one {{bacterial}} isolates {{were isolated}} from methyl parathion treated agricultural soil from {{in and around}} the Gwalior city, Madhya Pradesh to study the degradation of Methyl Parathion. Isolation was done by enrichment in Basal <b>mineral</b> <b>medium</b> with 50 mg/L methyl parathion as sole carbon and energy source. No supplement as a carbon and phosphorus source was added in medium. Methyl parathion utilizing capacities of twenty one isolates were studied with variable concentration of methyl parathion, ranging from 50 mg/L to 1600 mg/L in basal <b>mineral</b> <b>medium.</b> Three isolates EMP 11 c, EMP 12 a and EMP 12 b showed the highest degradation i. e. 97 %, 96. 4 % and 99. 9 % of 1200 mg/L methyl parathion respectively after 48 hrs at 30 °C and 7 pH. The degradation of methyl parathion was analysed by GC-MS. These bacterial isolates were identified as Pseudomonas diminuta (EMP 11 c), Pseudomonas putida (EMP 12 a) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (EMP 12 b), on the basis of biochemical characteristics and 16 S rRNA sequence analysis...|$|R
