5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying <b>figure.</b> <b>This</b> type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see <b>figure).</b> <b>This</b> probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clinical}} sense, a disorder {{is a condition}} requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. There {{is a lack of}} consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. Reactive attachment disorder indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of proximity seeking to an identified attachment <b>figure.</b> <b>This</b> can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of RAD under DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 are largely based on this {{understanding of the nature of}} attachment.|$|E

5|$|To {{the right}} of Sapieha are {{reformer}} Stanisław Staszic (26) and, with his hand around Staszic, Andrzej Zamoyski (27), author of the Zamoyski Codex, an earlier attempt to reform the state. To the left of Staszic, the head of bishop of Smoleńsk, Tymoteusz Gorzeński (28), is visible in the crowd. Beneath Staszic and Zamoyski, with an outstretched hand, is Kazimierz Konopka (29), Kołłątaj's secretary {{and one of the}} Polish Jacobins; Konopka has a French blue-white-red flower in his hat and a czekan, an ax- and hammer-like weapon, in his hand. Above them is an unnamed Eastern Orthodox priest (30); the figure on his right (31) is either Paweł Ksawery Brzostowski, pioneer of agricultural reforms, or Józef Stępkowski, a less progressive <b>figure.</b> <b>This</b> line of figures ends with Antoni Tyzenhauz (32), Lithuanian official and reformer. To {{the right of}} Zamoyski is an unnamed peasant (33). His passive attitude is seen as a representation of the unconcerned attitude of Polish peasantry towards the reforms.|$|E

25|$|For women's dress, {{the day to}} day outfit of {{the skirt}} and jacket style were {{practical}} and tactful, recalling the working class woman.

25|$|The 1920 census {{estimated}} {{the population of}} Santiago to be 507,296 inhabitants, equivalent to 13.6% {{of the population of}} Chile. This represented an increase of 52.47% from the census of 1907, i.e. an annual growth of 3.3%, almost three times the national <b>figure.</b> <b>This</b> growth was mainly due to the arrival of farmers from the south who came to work in factories and railroads which were under construction. However, this growth was experienced on the outskirts and not in the town itself.|$|E
25|$|Dedicated {{regions of}} the brain are {{specialized}} for given functions. Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions {{may account for the}} many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see <b>figure).</b> <b>This</b> is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the color of a grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by {{the position of the}} Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect is to increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the <b>figure.</b> <b>This</b> change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the 'body effect'.|$|E

25|$|The {{memory effect}} is {{evaluated}} using {{the ratio of}} Rmax to Rmin (see <b>figure).</b> <b>This</b> ratio increases with decreasing light intensity and has a value of 1.5–1.6 at 0.1 lux and 1.05–1.10 at 1000 lux for PerkinElmer devices. In some low-resistive RO models this ratio was as high as 5.5, but by 2009 their production has been discontinued. High-resistance photoresistors typically have a less pronounced memory effect, are less sensitive to temperature, and have a more linear response, but are also relatively slow. Some devices designed in the 1960s had a negligible memory effect, but exhibited unacceptably high signal distortions at high current levels.|$|E
25|$|This new figure elongates the {{established}} timeline: The Flight of the Noldor took 5 Valian Years (~50 of our years); {{with the new}} <b>figure</b> <b>this</b> would be 'translated' into ~700 of our years. Some commenters suggest that these new figures would be too long if applied directly to the existing dates and therefore the new definition is a wholly different measure than the one used in the timeline and cannot be applied directly. In contrast, Tolkien described time as having flowed more slowly in Aman, such that a Valian year there would 'feel' like {{the passage of a}} single solar year in Middle-earth despite being much longer.|$|E
