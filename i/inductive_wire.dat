40|$|We {{report on}} {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) measurements of phosphorus donors localized in a 200 square micron area below the <b>inductive</b> <b>wire</b> of a lumped element superconducting resonator. By combining quantum limited parametric amplification with a low impedance microwave resonator design {{we are able to}} detect around 20000 spins with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in a single shot. The 150 Hz coupling strength between the resonator field and individual spins is significantly larger than the 1 - 10 Hz coupling rates obtained with typical coplanar waveguide resonator designs. Due to the larger coupling rate, we find that spin relaxation is dominated by radiative decay into the resonator and dependent upon the spin-resonator detuning, as predicted by Purcell...|$|E

The power of the EMA is in the 1 to 5 kW range, the DC bus voltage is 540 V. It is also necessary to implement passive subsystems such as Electro-Magnetic-Interference (EMI) flters, power inductors, transformers, packaging and interconnection solution that withstand the wide temperature range.

40|$|Electromagnetic energy harvesting, i. e., {{capturing}} {{energy from}} ambient microwave signals, may become an essential part in extending the battery lifetime of wearable devices. Here, we present a design of a microwave energy harvester based on a cut-wire metasurface with an integrated PN junction diode. The cut wire with a quasistatic electric-dipole moment is designed to have a resonance at 6. 75 GHz, leading to a substantial cross-section for absorption. The external microwaves create a unidirectional current through the rectifying action of the integrated diode. Using an electrical-circuit model, we design the operating frequency and the resistive load of the cut wire. Subsequently, by optimizing our design using full-wave numerical simulations, we obtain an energy harvesting efficiency of 50 % for incident power densities {{in agreement with the}} typical power density of WiFi signals. Finally, we study the effect of connecting adjacent unit cells of the metasurface in parallel by a thin highly <b>inductive</b> <b>wire</b> and we demonstrate that this allows for the collection of current from all individual cells, while the microwave resonance of the unit cell is not significantly altered, thus solving the wiring problem that arises in many nonlinear metamaterials.

40|$|In this reprot, we {{introduce}} a new technique for designing miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces (MEFSSs) with bandpass responses and no spurious transmission windows over extremely large bandwidths. The proposed, harmonic-suppressed MEFSSs consist of multiple metallic and dielectric layers. Each metallic layer {{is in the form}} of a two-dimensional arrangement of capacitive patches or an <b>inductive</b> <b>wire</b> grid with extremely sub-wavelength periods. Harmonic-free operation in these structures is achieved by using multiple, closely-spaced capacitive layers with overlapping unit cells to synthesize a single, effective capacitive layer with a larger capacitance value. This allows for reducing the unit cell size of a conventional MEFSS considerably and moving the natural resonant frequencies of its constituting elements to considerably higher frequencies. Consequently, the spurious transmission windows of such MEFSSs, which are caused by these higher-order harmonics, can be shifted to very high frequencies and an extremely broad frequency band free of any spurious transmission windows can be obtained. Using this technique, an MEFSS with a second-order bandpass response is designed to operate at 3. 0 GHz with 20 % Fractional bandwidth and be free of spurious transmission bands up to 27. 0 GHz. A prototype of this harmonic-free MEFSS is fabricated and experimentally characterized in the lab. Measurement results confirm harmonic-free operation of the proposed FSS for incidence angles in the 60 range for both the TE and TM polarizations of incidence...|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of defects in photovoltaie (PV) {{inverters}} high frequency disturbances generated in the power electronics part can propagate in cables connected to the inverter. This may lead to high frequency interference currents in DC cables of PV generators which possibly cause problems regarding the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of adjacent electronic systems. Systems like communication equipment {{in the vicinity of}} the PV system are potentially affected by means of radiated and field coupled interferences. Interference currents on DC cables are mainly influenced by high frequency impedance characteristics of the components on the DC side. Within the scope of the European project ESDEPS (Electromagnetic Compatibility and Safety Design for Photovoltaic Systems) the impedance properties (i. e. the complex input impedance) of PV generators is investigated by means of methods and measurement techniques of high frequency engineering. In this investigation the PV inverter is considered as RF source. It delivers the maximal power to a load in {{the case of}} power matching. The load consists of DC cables and the PV generator. With the aid of these investigations, it should be determined under which conditions interferences can propagate on the DC side. Therefore the high frequency properties of components on the DC side must be characterised. Within these investigations the impedance of PV cells at frequencies from 300 kHz to 3 GHz and of PV modules from 300 kHz to 300 MHz are determined by means of measurements. With exception of a single resonance at 270 MHz the real part of the PV cell is low-impedance. The imaginary part is mainly caused by the <b>inductive</b> lead <b>wire</b> and the conductor configuration on top of the PV cell. In contrast to this, the impedance of a PV module shows a great number of resonance points because of several series connected PV cells. Series and parallel resonances alternate. In addition to the measurements numerical simulations of the high frequency characteristics of PV modules have been performed by means of the program package CONCEPT II...|$|R
40|$|In {{classical}} XY kagome antiferromagnets, {{there can}} be a novel low temperature phase where ψ 3 = e i 3 θ has quasi-long-range order but ψ is disordered, as well as more conventional antiferromagnetic phases where ψ is ordered in various possible patterns (θ is the angle of orientation of the spin). To investigate when these phases exist in a physical system, we study superconducting kagome wire networks in a transverse magnetic field when the magnetic flux through an elementary triangle is a half of a flux quantum. Within Ginzburg-Landau theory, we calculate the helicity moduli of each phase to estimate the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition temperatures. Then at the KT temperatures, we estimate the barriers to move vortices and effects that lift the large degeneracy in the possible ψ patterns. The effects we have considered are <b>inductive</b> couplings, non-zero <b>wire</b> width, and the order-by-disorder effect due to thermal fluctuations. The first two effects prefer q = 0 patterns while the last one selects a √ 3 × √ 3 pattern of supercurrents. Using the parameters of recent experiments, we conclude that at the KT temperature, the non-zero wire width effect dominates, which stabilizes a conventional superconducting phase with a q = 0 current pattern. However, by adjusting the experimental parameters, for example by bending the wires a little, it appears that the novel ψ 3 superconducting phase can instead be stabilized. The barriers to vortex motion are low enough that the system can equilibrate into this phase...|$|R
40|$|Originally, I {{was brought}} into the Design and Analysis Branch in the Crew and Thermal Systems to work on {{administrative}} tasks like archiving and scheduling. However, I ended up splitting my time between secretarial tasks and a technical project. My technical project was originally {{meant to be a}} wireless sensor package for the 20 ft Spacecraft Thermal Vacuum Chamber in the B 7 High Bay. I would be using a miniature wifi development board and a temperature/humidity sensor along with custom 3 D modeling to accomplish this. However, after some discussion with my technical mentor, the plan was changed to a mobile autonomous self-charging sensor platform. A mobile platform will allow the sensors to be moved around without depressurizing the chamber. Also, the self-charging aspect of the package allows for almost unlimited time in the chamber. If the on-board battery runs low, the robot can easily be driven to its charging dock and continue to transmit while charging. The driving base is based around a Raspberry Pi 3 board with a 12 C PMW DC Motor controller and a PWM controller driving two small gear motors. The sensor transmitter itself is a RHT 03 temperature and humidity sensor and Cozir CO 2 sensor connected to an ESP 8266 Huzzah board. The power distribution system utilizes a pair of 3. 7 v 3600 mah lipo batteries wired to Powerboost 500 boards. Also, the self-charging mechanism utilizes two 12 v-max <b>inductive</b> charging coils <b>wired</b> into the same Powerboost boards as the battery. The Raspberry pi is running Python 3. 3 for the driving base and Javascript MJPEG library for transmitting live video from the onboard camera. The sensor package is running Arduino-based C++ and the program capturing the data is running PyqtGraph Python and HTML. The shell of the robot itself is a 3 D printed case that will (work in progress) snap together. The photo to the left shows the two halves separated from each other. The black shell contains the power distribution boards and connectors while the white shell contains the driving base and data systems...|$|R
