5|$|On {{his first}} day in office, Daniels created Indiana's first Office of Management and Budget to look for inefficiencies and cost savings {{throughout}} state government. The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by <b>executive</b> <b>order,</b> removing the requirement that state employees pay union dues by rescinding a mandate created by Governor Evan Bayh in a 1989 <b>executive</b> <b>order.</b> Dues-paying union membership subsequently dropped 90% among state employees.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{extensively}} used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> on {{a number}} of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as President. By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish 150 million acres of reserved forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law. In total, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 <b>executive</b> <b>orders,</b> Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 <b>executive</b> <b>orders.</b> Roosevelt issued 1,081.|$|R

Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) to attach an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Regardless of whatever feelings Roosevelt may have had regarding this amendment, he signed the bill into law. However, prior to doing so, he again used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law. Roosevelt's willingness to make extensive use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> pertaining to land conservation may have been fueled by his belief that the preservation of the forests and waterways was the most important domestic issue facing the country in that period. In total, Roosevelt used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Roosevelt's use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> to protect the environment was another example of the extent to which Roosevelt's use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> differed from past presidents.|$|R

5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by <b>executive</b> <b>order.</b> However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by <b>executive</b> <b>order.</b> Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded {{neighboring}} Poland, starting World War II. After {{two years}} of combat neutrality, the United States was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese-Americans by issuing <b>Executive</b> <b>Order</b> 9066 on February 19, 1942. This <b>executive</b> <b>order</b> authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, set restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.|$|E
40|$|The {{issuance}} of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> is {{one out of}} several tools that presidents have at their disposal, which they can apply in order to implement policies and more controversially to expand their powers. Throughout the twentieth and continuing into the twenty first century, presidents {{have been able to}} claim broad powers through the {{issuance of}} <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> as they have implemented policies of legislative nature, taking a legislative role, and thus in practice used powers which are originally granted to the Congress in the Constitution. By examining the <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> issued from the presidency of FDR, up until present time, one finds that President William (Bill) J. Clinton used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> for foreign policy purposes more than any other president. The post- Cold War world was marked by instability and conflict, economic globalization and the opening up of new markets around the world, creating an interesting and challenging international environment in which to operate. As the first president elected after the Cold War’s end, Clinton faced the important task of re-inventing America’s central role on the international scene as he entered the Oval Office. This thesis explores how and why President Bill Clinton used <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> for foreign-policy purposes significantly more frequently than most of his predecessors in the 20 th century. It provides an assessment of Clinton’s use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> as part of his foreign policy, examining the foreign policy concept of “democratic enlargement”, and moreover, the importance of the economy as part of his foreign policies. Through the case study of the humanitarian intervention in Kosovo the thesis focuses on Clinton’s use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> as part of the new international environment facing the American government in the post-Cold War world. In doing so, the thesis shed light on important aspects of the use of <b>executive</b> <b>orders</b> implementing foreign policies. These include the issue of Separation of Powers and the War Powers Resolution, and the importance of the president’s ability to act and react swiftly when needed, through the issuance of <b>executive</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an <b>executive</b> <b>order</b> creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by <b>executive</b> <b>order.</b> Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
