40|$|Theme EThe {{problems}} of scheduling and schedule co-ordination in bus operations have conflicting objectives related to user’s cost and operator’s cost. Passengers {{would like to}} have public bus services where there is less waiting time. Operators on the other hand would like to earn profit with lesser vehicle operating cost and a minimum number of buses. In developing countries where overloading of buses has long been considered necessary to ensure bus travel remains affordable to most socioeconomic groups, bus operators would in addition to larger headways, like to have higher load factors to increase revenue even though passengers would prefer less load factors as it provides a more comfortable journey. All these factors are further constrained by the fare levels, which may not make the revenue adequate to operate at the most economically optimal frequency and load factor. This paper considers a method that is an extension to Newell’s Optimal Dispatching Policy, to determine a fleet size and <b>dispatching</b> <b>rate</b> based on both operator’s cost and user’s cost including the disutility of standing, in order to arrive at a global cost optimum. It further investigates the financial viability of providing such a service and sets out a financial viability domain within which optimization can occur in practice. If the resulting <b>dispatching</b> <b>rate</b> is lower and does not fall within the domain of financial viability, then operating subsidies are considered necessary to maintain the economically optimum <b>dispatching</b> <b>rate.</b> This method to compute optimized <b>dispatching</b> <b>rates</b> is based on screen-line counts across given locations along a bus routes used in conjunction with a limited sample of on-board boarding and alighting surveys. Passenger revenues have been computed by a process of multiplication of the rationalized origin-destination matrix by the fare for distance travelled between the respective origins and destinations. Indicators have also been developed to determine average trip lengths for each route and average revenue per passenger together with the points of maximum capacity along the route. These indicators describe the nature of the demand that the bus route serves. The screen line counts provide the hourly variation in demand over a bus route throughout the day, which has been expressed in terms of a polynomial equation to determine the variation of demand over different time periods. By combining both functions, a composite function has been developed to determine; the daily passenger demand on a given route; the total revenue for operators, the average load factor and locations on the route where maximum loading occurs.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze a {{production}} {{system with a}} finite feedback buffer and dispatching time. Parts enter a &# 8220;main buffer&# 8221; before they are processed. Processed parts leave the system with probability 1 − p or are fed back to a &# 8220;feedback buffer&# 8221; with probability p. As soon as the feedback buffer becomes full, the parts in the feedback buffer are dispatched, all at once, to the main buffer by the server for reprocessing. The dispatching time follows a general distribution. Thus the server is engaged either {{in one of the}} following states: idle, processing, dispatching. We derive various performance measures such as the mean number of parts in each buffer, the mean system sojourn time and the <b>dispatching</b> <b>rate.</b> We also discuss the effects of the dispatching time on the performance measures.

5000|$|After the {{introduction}} of the Il-62M, Aeroflot (the largest operator of the plane) gradually upgraded and later replaced its fleet of NK-8 powered Il-62s with the newer Soloviev D-30 KU-powered Il-62M. Coupled with engine nacelle and other modifications, greatly reduced the chance of contiguous powerplant damage. By mid 1973, the airline was operating some 60 Il-62s, and by 1989 this had increased to 165 (Il-62 and Il-62M) [...] The Il-62M had a <b>dispatch</b> <b>rate</b> with Aeroflot of 97% with some examples logging as many as 17 flight hrs/day, and it was described as the most reliable type in the fleet at that time [...] It set several international records in its class, mostly exemplifying a range capability far in excess of the conservative Aeroflot calculations applied in Soviet times. Some of these records were set by an all-woman crew of five captained by Iraida ("Inna") Vertiprahova. With 10 tonnes of freight, the Il-62M had a maximum range of 10,300 km compared to 9,412 km for the VC10 carrying the same weight. With a 23 tonne payload, the Il-62M range was 8000 km, compared to 6,920 km for a Boeing 707 with maximum payload. Because of its capacity, the plane has historically been used for emergency civilian evacuation flights, one of the most notable being the landing of an Aeroflot-registered Il-62 at Santiago Airport, Chile on the night of 10 Sep 1973 (the day before the military coup by Augusto Pinochet) in order to evacuate 147 Cuban embassy personnel. More recently (April 2015) two EMERCOM IL-62Ms (including RA-86495 of the Russian Federation Air Force) were used to evacuate around 900 foreign nationals and Yemenis from Sanaa during the Saudi-led military operation against Yemen.|$|E

30|$|FLPA {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Laurent et al. in [32]. The functional level power modeling approach is applicable to all types of processor architectures. Furthermore, FLPA modeling {{can be applied to}} a processor with moderate effort, and no detailed knowledge of the processors circuitry is needed. The basic idea behind the FLPA is the distinction of the processor architecture into functional blocks like processing Unit (PU), instruction management unit (IMU), internal memory, and others [32]. First, a functional analysis of these blocks is performed to specify and then discard the nonconsuming blocks (those with negligible impact on the power-consumption). The second step is to figure out the parameters that affect the power consumption of each of the power consuming blocks. For instance, the IMU is affected by the instructions <b>dispatching</b> <b>rate</b> which in turn is related to the degree of parallelism. In addition to these parameters, there are some parameters that affect the power consumption of all functional blocks in the same manner such as operating frequency and word length of input data.|$|R

40|$|It {{was with}} great {{interest}} that we read the letter written by Dr. Tourtier et al. in response to our article entitled “Cancellations of (helicopter-transported) mobile medical team dispatches in the Netherlands ” [1]. In his letter, Dr. Tourtier questions whether prehospital overtriage is caused by failure of triage criteria in identifying major trauma victims or {{is a result of}} non-achievement to implement these criteria. As he stated, strict adherence to triage protocol is rare. Since the mobile medical team (MMT) is a limited and expensive resource with safety risks involved, it is important to use this facility appropriately. Adherence to criteria is one part of the problem. Several studies have indeed shown that misinterpretation of triage protocols increase overtriage to high levels [2]. Nevertheless, misinterpretation of criteria can also lead to considerable undertriage rates. In the Netherlands, MMT <b>dispatch</b> <b>rates</b> and criteria adherence seem to be low. A previous study showed that there is still room for almost a sevenfold increase in MMT dispatches if strict adherence to dispatch criteria is maintained [3]. But the problem is also located in the ability of triage criteria to identify the patients who really need high levels of care (i. e., multitrauma, severe head injury).

40|$|Abstract: Many-task {{computing}} aims {{to bridge}} the gap between two computing paradigms, high throughput computing and high performance computing. Many-task computing denotes high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled via file system operations. The aggregate number of tasks, quantity of computing, and volumes of data may be extremely large. Traditional techniques found in production systems in the scientific community to support many-task computing do not scale to today's largest systems, due to issues in local resource manager scalability and granularity, efficient utilization of the raw hardware, long wait queue times, and shared/parallel file system contention and scalability. To address these limitations, we adopted a "top-down " approach to building a middleware called Falkon, to support the most demanding many-task computing applications at the largest scales. Falkon (Fast and Light-weight tasK executiON framework) integrates (1) multi-level scheduling to enable dynamic resource provisioning and minimize wait queue times, (2) a streamlined task dispatcher able to achieve orders-of-magnitude higher task <b>dispatch</b> <b>rates</b> than conventional schedulers, and (3) data diffusion which performs data caching and uses a data-aware scheduler to co-locate computational and storage resources.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the potential impact}} for ambulance services of telephone assessment and triage for callers who present with non-serious problems (Category C calls) as classified by ambulance service call takers. Design: Pragmatic controlled trial. Calls identified using priority dispatch protocols as non-serious were allocated to intervention and control groups according to time of call. Ambulance dispatch occurred according to existing procedures. During intervention sessions, nurses or paramedics within the control room used a computerised decision support system to provide telephone assessment, triage and, if appropriate, offer advice to permit estimation of the potential impact on ambulance dispatch. Setting: Ambulance services in London and the West Midlands. Subjects: Patients for whom emergency calls {{were made to the}} ambulance services between April 1998 and May 1999 during four hour sessions sampled across all days of the week between 0700 and 2300. Main outcome measures: Triage decision, ambulance cancellation, attendance at an emergency department. Results: In total, there were 635 intervention calls and 611 controls. Of those in the intervention group, 330 (52. 0 %) were triaged as not requiring an emergency ambulance, and 119 (36. 6 %) of these did not attend an emergency department. This compares with 55 (18. 1 %) of those triaged by a nurse or paramedic as requiring an ambulance (odds ratio 2. 62; 95 % CI 1. 78 to 3. 85). Patients triaged as not requiring an emergency ambulance {{were less likely to be}} admitted to an inpatient bed (odds ratio 0. 55; 95 % CI 0. 33 to 0. 93), but even so 30 (9. 2 %) were admitted. Nurses were more likely than paramedics to triage calls into the groups classified as not requiring an ambulance. After controlling for age, case mix, time of day, day of week, season, and ambulance service, the results of a logistic regression analysis revealed that this difference was significant with an odds ratio for nurses:paramedics of 1. 28 (95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 47). Conclusions: The findings indicate that telephone assessment of Category C calls identifies patients who are less likely to require emergency department care and that this could have a significant impact on emergency ambulance <b>dispatch</b> <b>rates.</b> Nurses were more likely than paramedics to assess calls as requiring an alternative response to emergency ambulance despatch, but the extent to which this relates to aspects of training and professional perspective is unclear.
