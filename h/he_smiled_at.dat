60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that Jack was rather anxious, {{although he did}} his best to conceal it. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> Captain Glasby, who smiled back. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> Lieutenant Harkness, but that under-officer only favored him with a scowl.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her, directly, rather forlornly, {{proud of}} her praise.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened his}} mouth, and understood. Then <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her directly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here," [...] thought <b>he,</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> the conceit,--"here come three elderly personages, and {{the first}} of the three is a venerable sage with a staff. What if this embassy should bring me the message of my fate!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> pleasantly <b>at</b> me, {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> his {{expression}} was kindly--anything but cruel or vindictive.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> confidentially <b>at</b> the {{darkness}} {{as if they}} shared a secret.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her. A princess wasn't half {{so terrible}} after all.|$|E
60|$|He saw {{the tears}} {{gathering}} in her eyes, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her encouragingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her quick {{adaptation}} {{of his professional}} slang, but shook his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> tranquilly <b>at</b> that {{reflection}} {{upon his}} courage and his skill.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> back <b>at</b> her. The reawakening of {{her sense}} of humour was something.|$|R
60|$|Slone evidently {{controlled}} his temper, {{though his}} face remained white. <b>He</b> even <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her sympathetically. Speech seemed {{somehow to}} lessen the tension between them.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her, and Eleanor felt {{again that}} vague fear {{stirring}} in her heart.|$|E
60|$|Gently {{she took}} his hand, and at the act <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her very weakly.|$|E
60|$|She {{remembered how}} sadly <b>he</b> had <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> {{her over the}} top of his paper.|$|R
60|$|Poor devil! {{he tries}} not to show his hurts. He suffers much what with that damnable wind and those ropes that cut into his tough sinews, but <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> every twinge of pain: smiles and laughs and cracks the {{broadest}} jokes that have e'er made these worm-eaten beams ring with their echo.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of the baseball player Bob Rodgers of the Los Angeles Angels, ca. 1961.

The words "Los Angeles" are written across his jersey while his baseball cap has the letters "LA" inscribed on it...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her in {{a knowing}} manner, and Jeanne looked away to hide her disgust.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} his shining teeth, and Philip, looking down, gave an embarrassed smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} upraised eyebrows. There {{were times when}} he seemed to her like a boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{likely you}} never did. Go away--go away. Didn't I bring up {{three pairs of}} Hammond twins before I was eleven? You and Sir Oracle are nothing but cold-blooded theorists. Gilbert, JUST look <b>at</b> him! <b>He's</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> me--he knows what we're talking about. And oo dest agwees wif evy word muzzer says, don't oo, angel-lover?" ...|$|R
60|$|Only Oros ate nothing, but {{remained}} where <b>he</b> was, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> us benignantly, nor did Ayesha touch any food.|$|R
60|$|We {{said good-bye}} {{at the club}} front door. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> down <b>at</b> me benevolently {{from the top of}} the steps.|$|R
60|$|She {{glanced at}} Austen's face, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her gently, {{as though he}} divined {{something}} of her thoughts.|$|E
60|$|His pipe was now alight. He drank {{his beer}} all at once, and he smoked and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> O'Moy with insolent compassion, and O'Moy, {{losing all}} his self-control, struck him slapped him resoundingly upon the cheek.|$|E
50|$|Summons a giant {{to stand}} on the horizon. <b>He</b> will <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> the enemy in battle. The spell lasts 3 days.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let not {{the knights}} of Leon or Asturias hear you speak thus of them," [...] said the Knight of the Leopard. [...] "But," [...] added <b>he,</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> the {{recollection}} of the morning's combat, [...] "if, instead of a reed, you were inclined to stand the cast of a battle-axe, there are enough of Western warriors who would gratify your longing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Checco, in talking, had {{recovered}} the assurance which at first seemed to fail him. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> politely <b>at</b> the Count's command, and said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} the sick room he thought her anxiety was justified. Lance {{did not look}} well, although <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her kindly enough, but {{he shook}} his head. [...] "It doesn't alter the fact that you're expensive. You've cost me already--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> her reassuringly. [...] "Something they didn't find! Something," [...] he added, after {{a slight}} pause, [...] "which they never will find!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good. And for {{how long}} might such a boy live after the news was told?' <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> merrily <b>at</b> Lurgan's Sahib's very beard.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> across <b>at</b> her. His {{words were}} words of courteous badinage, but Lady Cynthia was {{conscious}} of a strange little sense of pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "So ye see, my avenging angels, that ye run off {{the track}} in the Hucks matter," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> their bewildered faces.|$|R
