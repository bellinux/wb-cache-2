Babakotia radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years.

5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it <b>died</b> <b>out</b> sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E
