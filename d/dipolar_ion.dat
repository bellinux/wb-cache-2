40|$|An {{adequate}} {{theory of}} solutions for biological systems must {{depend upon the}} development of laws defining the mutual interaction, in each others presence, of ions and such dipolar ions 1 as amino acids, peptides, phospholipids, and proteins. The interaction between ions and dipolar ions {{is a function of}} the size, shape, and electrical moments of the latter, and also of the ionic strength and dielectric constant of the solution (5, 7). Precisely as the interaction between ions and one <b>dipolar</b> <b>ion</b> species may be shown to be diminished by the concentration of a second <b>dipolar</b> <b>ion,</b> so also increase in ionic strength may be shown to diminish the interaction between two species of dipolar ions. There is thus a multifunctional relation between the physical chemical behavior of the ionic and the dipolar ionic components of biological systems as a function of temperature, ionic strength, and dielectric constant, as well as of their specific properties. Unquestionably, the most important dipolar ions, as their name implies, are the proteins. In order to increase our knowledge of this class of molecules we have found it desirable, however, at each stage of our investigation, first to complete comparable investigations upon simpler molecules of known structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT Salting-out of {{proteins}} was discov-ered {{in the nineteenth}} century and is widely used for protein separation and crystallization. It is gen-erally believed that salting-out occurs because at high concentrations salts and the protein compete for solvation water. Debye and Kirkwood suggested ideas for explaining salting-out (Debeye and Mac-Aulay, Physik Z; 1925; 131 : 22 – 29; Kirkwood, In: Pro-teins, amino acids and peptides as <b>ions</b> and <b>dipolar</b> <b>ions.</b> New York: Reinhold; 1943. p 586 – 622). How-ever, a quantitative theory has not been developed, and such a theory is presented here. It is built on Kirkwood’s idea that a salt ion has a repulsive interactionwith an image charge inside a lowdielec-tric cavity. Explicit treatment is given for the effect of other salt ions on the interaction between a salt ion and its image charge. When combined with the Debye-Hückel effect of salts on the solvation energy of protein charges (i. e., salting-in), the characteris-tic curve of protein solubility versus salt concentra-tion is obtained. The theory yields a direct link between the salting-out effect and surface tension and is able to provide rationalizations for the effects of salt on the folding stability of several proteins...|$|R

40|$|Ion {{transfer}} and storage using inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) electric fields {{in combination with}} gas-assisted ion cooling and focusing constitutes {{one of the basic}} techniques in mass spectrometry today. The RF motion of ions in the bath gas environment involves a large number of ion-neutral collisions that leads to the internal activation of ions and their effective “heating” (when a thermal distribution of internal energies results). The degree of ion activation required in various applications may range from a minimum level (e. g., slightly raising the average internal energy) to an intense level resulting in ion fragmentation. Several research groups proposed using the effective temperature as a measure of ion activation under conditions of multiple ion-neutral collisions. Here we present approximate relationships for the effective ion temperature relevant to typical operation modes of RF multipole devices. We show that RF ion activation results in near-thermal energies for ions occupying an equilibrium position at the center of an RF trap, whereas increased ion activation can be produced by shifting ions off-center, e. g., by means of an external DC electric field.

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} restricted primitive model (ARPM) of electrolytes {{is proposed}} {{as a simple}} three parameter (charge q, diameter d, and charge displacement b) model of ionic liquids and solutions. Charge displacement allows electrostatic and steric interactions to operate between different centres, so that orientational correlations arise in ion-ion interactions. In this way the ionic system may have partly {{the character of a}} simple ionic fluid/solid and of a polar fluid formed from ion pairs. The present exploration of the system focuses on the ion pair formation mechanism, the relative concentration of paired and free ions and the consequences for the cohesive energy, and the tendency to form fluid or solid phase. In contrast to studies of similar (though not identical) models in the past, we focus on behaviours at room temperature. By MC and MD simulations of such systems composed of monovalent ions of hard-sphere (or essentially hard-sphere) diameter equal to 5 Å and a charge displacement ranging from 0 to 2 Å from the hard-sphere origin, we find that ion pairing dominates for b larger than 1 Å. When b exceeds about 1. 5 Å, the system is essentially a liquid of <b>dipolar</b> <b>ion</b> pairs with a small presence of free ions. We also investigate dielectric behaviours of corresponding liquids, composed of purely dipolar species. Many basic features of ionic liquids appear to be remarkably consistent with those of our ARPM at ambient conditions, when b is around 1 Å. However, the rate of self-diffusion and, to a lesser extent, conductivity is overestimated, presumably due to the simple spherical shape of our ions in the ARPM. The relative simplicity of our ARPM in relation to the rich variety of new mechanisms and properties it introduces, and to the numerical simplicity of its exploration by theory or simulation, makes it an essential step on the way towards representation of the full complexity of ionic liquids...|$|E

The second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency was estimated using the modified Kurtz–Perry powder test and {{was found to be}} 2. 5 times that of KDP. Introduction. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins that are considered to be the very important for most of the processes in living organisms [1] and their complexes belong to a class of organic materials find immense nonlinear optical (NLO) applications [2]. The presence of acidic carboxyl and basic amino group paves the way for the formation of zwitter ion or <b>dipolar</b> <b>ion</b> as a result of internal neutralization reaction. This dipolar nature of amino acids helps to improve the crystal's hardness [3] and the physical and chemical properties also making them as a peculiar candidates in nonlinear optical field [4]. The organic materials have excellent properties compared to the conventional inorganic solids which show ultrafast response times, lower dielectric constants, better process ability characteristics and enhanced NLO responses [5]. But the practical applications of the organic nonlinear optical materials are limited because of their poor physicochemical stability and low mechanical strength [6]. For overcoming the above difficulties of the organic NLO crystals, in recent years the organic materials were mixed with inorganic materials to improve their chemical stability, physico-chemical properties, mechanical strength and nonlinear optical coefficients, which are the important parameters for an NLO crystal [7, 8]. According to Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, the binding between metal and ligand is due to the interplay of donor and acceptor contributions [9]. Yukawa et al. [10] have already reported the structure of heptachloro(l-proline) tetramercury(II) and it belongs to monoclinic crystal system.

Aquaporins {{play an important role}} in regulating the water homeostasis in the diverse organs, and is heavily involved in human pathophysiology.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{development}} of a numerical model of trapped <b>dipolar</b> molecular <b>ions</b> forming a Coulomb crystal, such as in a linear ion trap. The model regards the system as an ensemble of classical dipoles which form a linear chain in one dimension, and a square lattice in two dimensions. The model was simulated using Metropolis Monte Carlo and the classical Heisenberg model with dipole-dipole interaction. The possibility of phase transitions in the system was investigated by studying the thermodynamic properties at different temperatures, finite system sizes, and boundary conditions. Previous studies of isotropic classical Heisenberg models in 1 D and 2 D have shown the absence of of any phase transitions. The 1 D dipolar system modeled in this thesis showed no evidence of a critical temperature related to a phase transition, but rather exhibited a slow transition between an ordered and a disordered state for temperatures T > 0. Similar results were obtained for the 2 D system, but in this case a method of finite size analysis suggested the existence of a critical temperature. In both systems the dipoles showed a preferential ordering along the z-axis, corresponding to the trap-axis of the ion trap, at low temperature. The results of the simulations are mostly inconclusive due to difficulties in properly evaluating the critical phenomena, and further improvements and extensions to the preliminary model are needed to get more reliable results...|$|R
40|$|Some {{properties}} of soluble chromium complexions containing coordinated aliphatic acids have been studied. The work falls naturally into two sections. In the first, {{the coordination of}} a series of ⊄, β and⊁amino acids by chromium chloride has been studied by physical methods. The tanning action of chromium chloride in the presence of these amino acids has also been studied. The absorption spectra of the complexes were similar to those reported previously for trivalent chromium solutions, having two pronounced maxima in the visible region. From the variations in these absorption maxima, it is suggested that the absorption maximum in the 580 m u region is influenced by coordination of the chromium with the ligand, while the maximum in the 420 m u region is also affected by the olation of the basic chromium salts. The spectrophotometric evidence indicates that raising the pH or the concentration of the ligand in the solution increases the amount of coordination, and further, that the tendency for coordination increases as the hydrocarbon chain separating the carboxyl and amino groups becomes longer. This suggests that tho stability of the complex is not dependent on chelate ring formation, but is influenced by the pK₁ value of the carboxyl group of the. ligand. Potentiometric titrations support the hypothesis that only the carboxyl group is coordinated, to an extent depending on its pK₁ value, since the curves have shown that the amino group is still free to titrate. Paper electrophoresis has shown that all the complexes prepared were cationic, indicating that the amino acids were coordinated as <b>dipolar</b> <b>ions.</b> The tanning action of the masked chromium solutions has confirmed the deductions made from the physical measurements. Increasing the amount of amino acid added to the solution lowered the chromium fixation and the hydrothermal stability of the leather, and further, that for solutions at the same pH containing the same amount of masking agent, tanning action was least for the ⊁ amino acid and greatest for the ⊄ amino acids. Comparison of the present data with the corresponding results obtained with chrome alum solutions showed that coordination of the amino acids was greater {{in the case of the}} chromium chloride solutions. The second section of the experimental work was an investigation of the coordination of substituted acetic and propionic acids by chromium chloride and chromium sulphate. Spectrophotometric and potentiometric methods were applied and the various solutions were also used in miniature tanning experiments. Certain difficulties were encountered in the preparation of some of the complexes, and it was not possible to carry the work to a point where conclusive results could be obtained. Nevertheless, the work reported suggests that chelate ring formation occurs in the coordination of hydroxy-carboxylic acids, resulting in exceptionally high stability of the complex. In the case of the other ligands, containing amino, chloro and bromo groups, as well as with acetic and propionic acids, the results suggest that coordination involves the carboxyl group only, and that the pY value of this group is an important factor determining the stability of the complexes...|$|R

Matrix diagonalisation and Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory simulations are presented, which show excellent agreement with the experimental results over a range of energies and fields. It is demonstrated that, using this bilateral approach, the Stark spectra can be used to gain greater insight into the complex electron - ion core interactions than can be achieved with zero-field spectra alone, through parametrisation in terms of quantum defects. Trajectory calculations for a beam of Rydberg atoms in the inhomogeneous electric field created by a dipole, quadrupole and hexapole are presented. These demonstrate that significant deflection and focusing of Rydberg atoms and molecules should be achievable under realistic experimental conditions. Controlled deflection of a beam of krypton atoms in the field of a dipole was realised experimentally. The observed deflection of up to 3 mm over an axial distance of 8 cm is in good agreement with the trajectory predictions, as is the variation of the deflection with selected quantum state. Finally an investigation into the possible control of the orientation of a <b>dipolar</b> <b>ion</b> core using Stark Rydberg states is presented. Matrix diagonalisation calculations are shown which suggest that significant orientation can be achieved, the degree and direction of which can be controlled by appropriate selection of the state excited and magnitude of the field applied.

A somewhat exotic, but nevertheless readily available family of carbohydrates allowing a fascinating chemistry are inositols (cyclohexane- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexols). myo-Inositol which is the stereoisomer with one axial hydroxyl group, is commercially available at reasonable prices. Inositols have been used previously as hydrophilic head group in amphiphilic liquid crystals, and recently our group involved myo-inositol in syntheses of surface active agents (surfactants). It seems that one unit of myo-inositol {{is not enough to}} assure a good aqueous solubility for these compounds.
