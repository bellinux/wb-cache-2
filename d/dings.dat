Westbury Park {{declined}} the merger and folded, with many of its players joining Bristol. Bristol Rugby has often competed at the highest level of the sport since its formation in 1888. The club played at the Memorial Ground, which it shared with Bristol Rovers from 1996. Although Bristol Rugby owned the stadium when the football club arrived, a decline in the rugby club's fortunes led to a transfer of ownership to Bristol Rovers. In 2014 Bristol Rugby moved to their new home, Ashton Gate Stadium (home to Bristol Rovers' rivals Bristol City), for the 2014–15 season. Dating from 1901, the Bristol Combination and its 53 clubs promote rugby union in the city and help support Bristol Rugby. The most prominent of Bristol's smaller rugby clubs include Clifton Rugby, <b>Dings</b> Crusaders, and Cleve. Rugby league is represented in Bristol by the Bristol Sonics.|$|E

40|$|The Escherichia coli DNA damage-inducible protein <b>DinG,</b> {{a member}} of the {{superfamily}} 2 DNA helicases, has been implicated in the nucleotide excision repair and recombinational DNA repair pathways. Combining UV-visible absorption, EPR, and enzyme activity measurements, we demonstrate here that E. coli <b>DinG</b> contains a redox-active [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster with a midpoint redox potential (Em) of – 390 ± 23 mV (pH 8. 0) and that reduction of the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster reversibly switches off the <b>DinG</b> helicase activity. Unlike the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster in E. coli dihydroxyacid dehydratase, the <b>DinG</b> [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster is stable, and the enzyme remains fully active after exposure to 100 -fold excess of hydrogen peroxide, indicating that <b>DinG</b> could be functional under oxidative stress conditions. However, the <b>DinG</b> [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster can be efficiently modified by nitric oxide (NO), forming the DinG-bound dinitrosyl iron complex with the concomitant inactivation of helicase activity in vitro and in vivo. Reassembly of the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster in NO-modified <b>DinG</b> restores helicase activity, indicating that the iron-sulfur cluster in <b>DinG</b> is the primary target of NO cytotoxicity. The results led us to propose that the iron-sulfur cluster in <b>DinG</b> may act as a sensor of intracellular redox potential to modulate its helicase activity and that modification of the iron-sulfur cluster in <b>DinG</b> and likely in other DNA repair enzymes by NO may contribute to NO-mediated genomic instability...|$|R

In humans, at least five different <b>DING</b> proteins have been identified, which were implicated in important biological processes and diseases, including HIV.

These proteins share the ability to inhibit the transcriptional step of HIV- 1, a key step of the viral cycle that is not yet targeted by the current therapies. Since such proteins have been isolated from humans, we undertook a comprehensive study that focuses on the relationship between these proteins and HIV-infection in an infectious context. Hence, we developed a home-made ELISA for the quantification of the concentration of <b>DING</b> proteins in human serum. Using this method, we were able to determine the concentration of <b>DING</b> proteins in healthy and HIV-infected patients. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase of the concentration of <b>DING</b> proteins in non treated and treated HIV-infected patients compared to controls. In addition, cell cultures infected with HIV also show an increased expression of <b>DING</b> proteins, ruling out the possible role of antiretroviral treatment in the increase of the expression of <b>DING</b> proteins.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>DING</b> {{proteins}} encompass {{an intriguing}} protein family first characterized by their conserved N-terminal sequences. Some of these proteins {{seem to have}} key roles in various human diseases, e. g., rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, HIV suppression. Although this protein family seems to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes, their genes are consistently lacking from genomic databases. Such a lack has considerably hampered functional studies and has fostered therefore the hypothesis that <b>DING</b> proteins isolated from eukaryotes were in fact prokaryotic contaminants. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the framework of our study, we have performed a comprehensive immunological detection of <b>DING</b> proteins in mice. We demonstrate that <b>DING</b> proteins are present in all tissues tested as isoforms of various molecular weights (MWs). Their intracellular localization is tissue-dependant, being exclusively nuclear in neurons, but cytoplasmic and nuclear in other tissues. We also provide evidence that germ-free mouse plasma contains as much <b>DING</b> protein as wild-type. SIGNIFICANCE: Hence, data herein provide a valuable basis for future investigations aimed at eukaryotic <b>DING</b> proteins, revealing that these proteins seem ubiquitous in mouse tissue. Our results strongly suggest that mouse <b>DING</b> proteins are endogenous. Moreover, the determination {{in this study of}} the precise cellular localization of <b>DING</b> proteins constitute a precious evidence to understand their molecular involvements in their related human diseases...|$|R

The <b>DING</b> algorithm does not require the calculation of a sampling density compensation function, which is often problematic. <b>DING’s</b> sparse linear system is inverted efficiently using the conjugate gradient (CG) method.

40|$|DNA {{possesses}} the curious ability to conduct charge longitudinally through the π-stacked base pairs that reside within {{the interior of}} the double helix. The rate of charge transport (CT) through DNA has a shallow distance dependence. DNA CT can occur over at least 34 nm, a very long molecular distance. Lastly, DNA CT is exquisitely sensitive to disruptions, such as DNA damage, that affect the dynamics of base-pair stacking. Many DNA repair and DNA-processing enzymes are being found to contain 4 Fe- 4 S clusters. These co-factors have been found in glycosylases, helicases, helicase-nucleases, and even enzymes such as DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, and primase across the phylogeny. The role of these clusters in these enzymes has remained elusive. Generally, iron-sulfur clusters serve redox roles in nature since, formally, the cluster can exist in multiple oxidation states that can be accessed within a biological context. Taken together, these facts were used as a foundation for the hypothesis that DNA-binding proteins with 4 Fe- 4 S clusters utilize DNA-mediated CT as a means to signal one another to scan the genome as a first step in locating the subtle damage that occurs within a sea of undamaged bases within cells. Herein we describe a role for 4 Fe- 4 S clusters in DNA-mediated charge transport signaling among EndoIII, MutY, and <b>DinG,</b> which are from distinct repair pathways in E. coli. The <b>DinG</b> helicase is an ATP-dependent helicase that contains a 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. To study the DNA-bound redox properties of <b>DinG,</b> DNA-modified electrochemistry was used to show that the 4 Fe- 4 S cluster of DNA-bound <b>DinG</b> is redox-active at cellular potentials, and shares the 80 mV vs. NHE redox potential of EndoIII and MutY. ATP hydrolysis by <b>DinG</b> increases the DNA-mediated redox signal observed electrochemically, likely reflecting better coupling of the 4 Fe- 4 S cluster to DNA while <b>DinG</b> unwinds DNA, which could have interesting biological implications. Atomic force microscopy experiments demonstrate that <b>DinG</b> and EndoIII cooperate at long range using DNA charge transport to redistribute to regions of DNA damage. Genetics experiments, moreover, reveal that this DNA-mediated signaling among proteins also occurs within the cell and, remarkably, is required for cellular viability under conditions of stress. Knocking out <b>DinG</b> in CC 104 cells leads to a decrease in MutY activity that is rescued by EndoIII D 138 A, but not EndoIII Y 82 A. <b>DinG,</b> thus, appears to help MutY find its substrate using DNA-mediated CT, but do MutY or EndoIII aid <b>DinG</b> in a similar way? The InvA strain of bacteria was used to observe <b>DinG</b> activity, since <b>DinG</b> activity is required within InvA to maintain normal growth. Silencing the gene encoding EndoIII in InvA results in a significant growth defect that is rescued by the overexpression of RNAseH, a protein that dismantles the substrate of <b>DinG,</b> R-loops. This establishes signaling between <b>DinG</b> and EndoIII. Furthermore, rescue of this growth defect by the expression of EndoIII D 138 A, the catalytically inactive but CT-proficient mutant of EndoIII, is also observed, but expression of EndoIII Y 82 A, which is CT-deficient but enzymatically active, does not rescue growth. These results provide strong evidence that <b>DinG</b> and EndoIII utilize DNA-mediated signaling to process DNA damage. This work thus expands the scope of DNA-mediated signaling within the cell, as it indicates that DNA-mediated signaling facilitates the activities of DNA repair enzymes across the genome, even for proteins from distinct repair pathways. In separate work presented here, it is shown that the UvrC protein from E. coli contains a hitherto undiscovered 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. A broad shoulder at 410 nm, characteristic of 4 Fe- 4 S clusters, is observed in the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of UvrC. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of UvrC incubated with sodium dithionite, reveals a spectrum with the signature features of a reduced, [4 Fe- 4 S]+ 1, cluster. DNA-modified electrodes were used to show that UvrC has the same DNA-bound redox potential, of 80 mV vs. NHE, as EndoIII, <b>DinG,</b> and MutY. Again, this means that these proteins are capable of performing inter-protein electron transfer reactions. Does UvrC use DNA-mediated signaling to facilitate the repair of its substrates? UvrC is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in E. coli and is the protein within the pathway that performs the chemistry required to repair bulky DNA lesions, such as cyclopyrimidine dimers, that form as a product of UV irradiation. We tested if UvrC utilizes DNA-mediated signaling to facilitate the efficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage products by helping UvrC locate DNA damage. The UV sensitivity of E. coli cells lacking <b>DinG,</b> a putative signaling partner of UvrC, was examined. Knocking out <b>DinG</b> in E. coli leads to a sensitivity of the cells to UV irradiation. A 5 - 10 fold reduction in the amount of cells that survive after irradiation with 90 J/m 2 of UV light is observed. This is consistent with the hypothesis that UvrC and <b>DinG</b> are signaling partners, but is this signaling due to DNA-mediated CT? Complementing the knockout cells with EndoIII D 138 A, which can also serve as a DNA CT signaling partner, rescues cells lacking <b>DinG</b> from UV irradiation, while complementing the cells with EndoIII Y 82 A shows no rescue of viability. These results indicate that there is cross-talk between the NER pathway and <b>DinG</b> via DNA-mediated signaling. Perhaps more importantly, this work also establishes that <b>DinG,</b> EndoIII, MutY, and UvrC comprise a signaling network that seems to be unified by the ability of these proteins to perform long range DNA-mediated CT signaling via their 4 Fe- 4 S clusters. ...|$|R
