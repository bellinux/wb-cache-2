50|$|The {{front forks}} are {{slightly}} different {{between the two}} models. Both models feature air assistance,but the B1 model uses an air valve located {{at the top of}} the fork leg while the B2 uses an equalisertube linking the two tube with a single air valve. By using an equaliser tube, each <b>inner</b> <b>fork</b> tube requires a small hole to allow the air in. The lower legs are different as the different brake disk diameter used on the two models require the mounting points to be different.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are pale yellow, much mottled with bright reddish ferruginous, and clouded with chestnut brown. This is most conspicuous {{in a broad}} fasciaform shade, commencing a little before {{the middle of the}} costa, extending outward to the costal cilia, narrowed downward to the cell, and thence bifurcate to the dorsum. The <b>inner</b> <b>fork,</b> more conspicuous than the outer, forming a brown dorsal patch at one-fourth from the base, the outer fork diffused toward the termen which is also shaded throughout with chestnut brown. The hindwings are dark tawny brown, tending to brownish fuscous toward their apex; cilia brownish grey, with a paler, patch below the apex.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 51) A successful {{method for}} predicting the fatigue life of mountain bicycle suspension <b>fork</b> <b>inner</b> legs for the ASTM fatigue test {{was developed in}} this project. An analysis method was created to calculate the stress in legs based on the magnitude of an externally applied load, its reactions in the entire substructure of the fork, {{as well as any}} stress concentrations due to variation in the leg's profile geometry. The analysis also calculated the secondary source of stress created due to an interference fit between legs and crown. This analysis was extended to twenty-nine different configurations of legs, and a range of maximum stresses was used as input for fatigue testing. The raw material from which the legs were made was fatigue in isolation tested to failure to create an S-N diagram. The heat treatment of the raw material was varied over a range used in industry to most accurately represent the variation in material conditions of the final product. Statistical data curves were generated to capture the upper and lower bounds of fatigue life variation. Eighty-three documented ASTM fatigue test results were compared to the curves. Successful results where the data was within the curves were yielded for seventy-two out of the eighty-three data points. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was created and coded with Visual Basic to encapsulate all of the aforementioned calculations and return a stress analysis and fatigue life prediction for future design...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} A. lincolnense {{are divided into}} three {{leaflets}}, with the lateral leaflets pinnately veined and ranging between 1.5 - 4.8 cm in length. The leaflet blades rest against the primary vein of the leaf, lacking petiolules, and have an asymmetric base flaring out on the basal side while remaining narrow on the apical side. Each lateral leaflet has between 5 and 7 secondary veins that alternate between forking near the vein tip before reaching the blade margin, and curving upwards near the tip to join the next secondary vein up. The forking secondary veins brace the sinuses between the teeth on the blade margins. Overall {{the teeth of the}} leaflets are large and simple, though the largest of the teeth have to smaller subsidiary teeth. The terminal leaflets on the type specimens are incomplete, so length and width of them is not known. They have a symmetrical leaflet base that is acute in shape, the blade being an inverted v shape. The leaves have tertiary veins that form either an mix of acute angle-right angle structuring or right angle-right angle structuring with the veins spaced 0.7 - 1.3 cm apart. The quaternary veins form a network of areoles that are irregular polygons.As with other species of Acer the fruits are a samara with a basal nutlet and apical wing. The nutlets are lancolate in outline with a narrow rounded apex, and a convex basal side. The nutlet is 1.0 cm long by 0.4 cm wide, with a 0.4 cm scar where the fruit attached to a second fruit at an angle of 30°. There is a thick vein running along the apical side of the nutlet and 7 loosely grouped veins running up {{the outer edge of the}} wing. The wing is 1.2 cm long and 0.7 cm wide with the outer edge broadly curving, and with undulating veins that diverge from each other at angles between 5° to 10°. The veins curve slightly between leaving the proximal vascular group and reaching the <b>inner</b> wing margin, <b>forking</b> along the way.|$|R
