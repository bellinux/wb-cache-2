5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E

Despite the president's views regarding slavery, which stemmed in large part from his belief that the institution was predicated on sin, Lord permitted several African Americans to attend the college.

After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), Grampa advises Marge to put Homer in a round of golf, where he will become too distracted to even bother her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addictive to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge them realizes that she was <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having make up sex. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again anywhere in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person could drink before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the Fox network, something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including Rupert Murdoch, who asks him to put on The Jay Leno Show.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin soon {{created a}} legal storm {{that was to}} engulf Peter, {{threatening}} his career. He was determined to reform the diocese thoroughly, making it function more efficiently {{as a base for}} his position as one of the chief magnates of the realm. He saw the chapter of Canterbury Cathedral as a major obstacle. Like most cathedral establishments, it had consisted of secular clergy until the Norman Conquest, after which it was reconstituted as a community of Benedictine monks, known variously as the Priory of the Holy Trinity or Christchurch. The mutual antagonism was sharpened by the rivalry between their respective monastic orders, as Baldwin was a Cistercian. He began by recovering diocesan property which his predecessor had alienated to the priory in order to support the pilgrim traffic, centred on the shrine of Thomas Becket, as well as confiscating the xenia, or Easter offerings – a process which was authorised by Pope Lucius III. However, the monks of the chapter were soon complaining to his successor, Urban III, that his reforms were <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and succeeded in getting the Pope to order restoration of some of the confiscated churches. Urban initially welcomed some aspects of Baldwin's overarching plan to move the chapter to Hackington, north of Canterbury, and to build a second base for the diocese at Lambeth, directly facing the centres of secular power in London and Westminster. However, the plan unfolded to include the replacement of the monastic chapter with a new episcopal staff, consisting of colleges of secular clergy at Hackington and Lambeth.|$|E

500|$|... "Paper Hearts" [...] {{was written}} {{specifically}} with Tom Noonan {{in mind for}} the role of Roche, and was amongst the first television work the actor had done. Writer Vince Gilligan came up with the concept for the episode [...] when thinking about the series' longest running storyline, the abduction of Samantha Mulder. Gilligan came up with a story questioning whether Samantha had not been abducted by aliens, but was rather murdered by a child killer instead. He decided to help convince Fox Mulder of this through a series of prophetic dreams. The laser lights in Mulder's dreams were influenced by Gilligan's experience with laser holograms while he was a film student. The laser {{was supposed to be the}} color blue, but was changed to red in production to reduce costs. Wanting to include some kind of fetish for the killer, Gilligan settled on having Roche cut heart shaped fragments from his victim's clothing, thinking that having him mutilate his victims' bodies would be <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b>|$|E

IGN's Justin Davis praised the game's unpredictable and [...] "poignant" [...] ending {{at the bottom}} of the Arctic Floes. He added that the game could have been [...] "even more ridiculous" [...] and its levels more differentiated in theme and art style, though he found the [...] "almost cubist design ... absolutely gorgeous". Welsh of Eurogamer agreed that Wohlwend's art was [...] "achingly cool" [...] and reflected a [...] "retro and minimalist" [...] indie gaming trend without overpowering the gameplay. Welsh also praised the game's character by way of its fake Twitter feed, and Pocket Gamer Rob Hearn compared its imaginative character to that of Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Brooks and Groening were {{involved}} in a public dispute over the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns". Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute advertisement for Brooks' show The Critic (which had moved to Fox from ABC for its second season), and was created by former The Simpsons showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because [...] "articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [...] created The Critic", and removed his names from the credits. In response, Brooks said [...] "I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons' universe he was right and we agreed to his changes.

Angier realizes that [...] "Alfred Borden" [...] is actually an identity assumed by twin brothers who took turns being Borden and Fallon; the twin who loved his hanged wife Sarah, {{and the one who}} loved the assistant Olivia. Fallon loved Olivia and is the more hot headed of the two brothers; he is the twin who, despite promising not to return to Angier's show, does so and is caught. Fallon, having exacerbated Sarah's depression which leads to her suicide, is the twin who is hanged. The surviving twin is Sarah's husband. Borden berates Angier for <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> in his quest for dominance. Angier explains that giving his audience a moment of wonder, and to bask in their applause, was his great ambition. Angier dies as his fallen lantern sets the theater on fire. Borden picks up his daughter, Jess, at Cutter's workshop. A final glimpse of the burning theater shows what looks like the body of Angier in a water tank near the dead body.|$|E

The Simpsons visit Australia in [...] "Bart vs. Australia" [...] (season six, 1995) and Brazil in [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board—which claimed {{that the city was}} portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic. He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode [...] "violates the Simpsons' universe."

[...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter."

500|$|The same year, Holmes was {{approached}} by Martin Delany, an African-American man {{who had worked with}} Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved That we have no objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery.

McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not <b>going</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E
