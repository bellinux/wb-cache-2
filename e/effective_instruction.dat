40|$|The {{automatic}} {{production of}} Natural Language instructions, i. e. those {{suitable for use}} by humans, has become an active area of research in recent years. In order for computer-generated instructions to be useful, they must be effective in accurately conveying the actions {{that are to be}} carried out by an agent. Conveying termination information, or when to stop performing an action, {{has been the focus of}} my dissertation research as it is an important part of generating <b>effective</b> <b>instructions.</b> I have done a corpus analysis of 3000 simple step-by-step maintenance instructions to study how termination information is expressed in naturally occurring texts. Using insights gained from the corpus analysis as well as the simulation of virtual agents carrying out similar tasks, I have specified an action representation, rules for reasoning about action information (particularly termination information), and some differences between agents with different levels of expertise. SPUD, a Natural Language generator developed at the University of Pennsylvania, takes this information, as well as information about the syntactic constructions used in instructions, and reasons about the best way to convey action information in <b>effective</b> <b>instructions</b> for particular agents. ...|$|R

A comprehension mechanism transforms written instructions into goals that control an action planning process proposed by Kitajima and Polson [11]. The transformation process is based on a theory of solving word problems developed by Kintsch [8, 9]. The comprehension and action planning processes define constraints on the wording of <b>effective</b> <b>instructions.</b> The combined model is evaluated using data from Franzke [3].
