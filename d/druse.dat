The peoples inhabiting {{the region of the}} Sharon battlefield varied greatly in their background, religious beliefs and political outlook. Living from Jericho northwards, were indigenous Jews in Samaria, Moravians in Galilee, some <b>Druse,</b> Shi'a Metawals and a few Nussiri (pagans). In the east were the Bedouin. In Haifa town, about half the population was Muslim and in Acre almost all were Muslim. On the Esdraelon Plain as far as Beisan were Sunni Arabs and one new Jewish colony near Afulah. Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in the foothill country of Northern Galilee. Christians of at least five denominations formed a large majority in and around Nazareth town. The inhabitants of the eastern part of this Northern Galilee area were predominantly indigenous Jews, who had always inhabited Tiberias and Safed. In the region of the Nablus battlefield, the inhabitants from Beersheba to Jericho were also quite diverse. The population was mainly Arab of the Sunni branch of Islam, with some Jewish colonists and Christians. At Nablus, they were almost exclusively Moslems excepting the less than 200 members of the Samaritan sect of original Jews. To the east of the Jordan Valley in the Es Salt district were Syrian and Greek Orthodox Christians, and near Amman, Circassians and Turkmans.|$|E

2500|$|... (2001) was a {{paperback}} tie-in for the King-penned miniseries Rose Red (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, {{the book was}} written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written {{in the form of a}} diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to Rose Red, titled The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on Kingdom Hospital and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, The Journals of Eleanor <b>Druse,</b> in 2004. Eleanor <b>Druse</b> is a key character in Kingdom Hospital, much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in Rose Red.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Mandate period, in the 1922 census of Palestine, Acre had 6,420 residents: 4,883 of whom were Muslim; 1,344 Christian; 102 Baha'i; 78 Jewish and 13 Druze. The British Mandate government reconstructed Acre, and its economic situation improved. The 1931 census counted 7,897 people in Acre, 6076 Muslims, 1523 Christians, 237 Jews, 51 Baha'i and 10 <b>Druse.</b> In 1945 Acre's population numbered 12,360; 9,890 Muslims, 50 Jews, 2,330 Christians, and 90 classified as [...] "other".|$|E
2500|$|The Druze {{living in}} the Golan Heights are {{permanent}} residents of Israel. They hold laissez-passers issued by the Israeli government, and enjoy the country's social welfare benefits. The pro-Israeli Druze were historically ostracized by the pro-Syrian Druze. Reluctance to accept citizenship also reflects fear of ill treatment or displacement by Syrian authorities should the Golan Heights eventually be returned to Syria. According to The Independent, most Druze in the Golan Heights live relatively comfortable lives in a freer society {{than they would have}} in Syria under Assad's government. According to Egypt's Daily Star, their standard of living vastly surpasses that of their counterparts on the Syrian side of the border. Hence their fear of a return to Syria, though most of them identify themselves as Syrian, but feel alienated from the [...] "autocratic" [...] government in Damascus. According to the Associated Press, [...] "many young <b>Druse</b> have been quietly relieved at the failure of previous Syrian-Israeli peace talks to go forward." [...] On the other hand, expressing pro-Syrian rhetoric, The Economist found, represents the Golan Druzes' view that by doing so they may be potentially rewarded by Syria, while simultaneously risking nothing in Israel's freewheeling society. The Economist likewise reported that [...] "Some optimists see the future Golan as a sort of Hong Kong, continuing to enjoy the perks of Israel’s dynamic economy and open society, while coming back under the sovereignty of a stricter, less developed Syria." [...] The Druze are also reportedly well-educated and relatively prosperous, and have made use of Israel's universities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{two years}} before the miniseries aired, the {{producers}} contracted with author Ridley Pearson to write a tie-in novel, , under the pseudonym [...] "Dr. Joyce Reardon" [...] (one of the main characters of the miniseries). The novel presented itself as nonfiction, and claimed to be the actual diary of Ellen Rimbauer (wife of the builder of Rose Red). The work was originally intended to be an architectural book featuring photos and drawings of the fictional Rose Red house with the supernatural elements subtly woven into the text and photos, but Pearson (building on several references to a diary in King's script) wrote it as Ellen Rimbauer's diary instead. Inspired by the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project, King {{came up with the idea}} of presenting the novel as real by having [...] "Dr. Joyce Reardon" [...] edit the [...] "diary". King also inserted a reference into the book's foreword that a [...] "best-selling author had found the journal in Maine", so that fans would be misled into concluding that King had written the work. The ruse worked. Fans and the press speculated for some time that Stephen King or his wife Tabitha King had written the book until Pearson was revealed to be the novel's author. The companion novel was a hit, rising high on several bestseller lists. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to Rose Red, titled The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on Kingdom Hospital and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, The Journals of Eleanor <b>Druse,</b> in 2004.|$|E
6000|$|The {{principal}} {{feature of}} this administrative design was the institution of two governors of Lebanon, called Caimacams, {{one of whom was}} to be a Maronite and govern the Maronites, and the other a <b>Druse</b> and govern his fellow-countrymen. Superficially, this seemed fair enough, but reduced into practice the machinery would not work. For instance, the populations in many places were blended. Was a <b>Druse</b> Caimacam to govern the Christians in his district? Was the government of the two Caimacams to be sectarian or geographical? Should the Christian Caimacam govern all the Christians, and the <b>Druse</b> Caimacam govern all the Druses of the Lebanon? Or should the Christian Caimacam govern the Christian Mook-atas, as well as such Druses as lived mixed with the Christians in the Christian Mookatas, and the <b>Druse</b> Caimacam in the <b>Druse</b> country exercise the same rights? ...|$|E
60|$|After firing his shot, Private Carter <b>Druse</b> reloaded {{his rifle}} and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal {{sergeant}} crept cautiously {{to him on}} hands and knees. <b>Druse</b> neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.|$|E
60|$|Downing Street (1842) decided {{upon the}} sectarian {{government}} of the Lebanon. It was simple, and probably satisfactory, to Exeter Hall; but Downing Street was quite unaware, or had quite forgotten, that the feudal system prevailed throughout Lebanon. The Christians in the <b>Druse</b> districts were vassals of <b>Druse</b> lords. The direct rule of a Christian Caimacam was an infringement on all the feudal rights of the Djinblats and Yezbecks, of the Talhooks and the Abdel-Maleks. It would be equally fatal to the feudal rights of the Christian chiefs, the Kazins and the El-dadahs, the Elheires and the El Dahers, as regarded their <b>Druse</b> tenantry, unless the impossible plan of the patriarch of the Maronites, which had already produced a civil war, had been adopted. Diplomacy, therefore, seemed {{on the point of}} at length succeeding in uniting the whole population of Lebanon in one harmonious action, but unfortunately against its own project.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thou {{son of a}} slave!' exclaimed the lady, 'thou {{masquerade}} of humanity! Christian or Mussulman, Pagan or <b>Druse,</b> thou mayest figure as; but spare my race, Fakredeen, {{they are}} fallen----' ...|$|E

6000|$|Downing Street, frightened, gave up sectarian diplomacy, and {{announced}} {{the adoption of}} the geographical principle of government. The Druses, now that their feudal privileges were secured, cooled in their ardour for nationality. The Shehaabs, on the other hand, finding that the Druses were not to be depended on, changed their note. 'Is it to be tolerated for a moment, that a Christian should be governed by a <b>Druse?</b> Were it a Moslem, one might bear it; these things will happen; but a <b>Druse,</b> who adores a golden calf, worshippers of Eblis! One might as well be governed by a Jew.' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>Druse</b> had a strange, half-defined {{feeling that he}} had slept {{to the end of}} the war and was looking upon a noble work of art reared upon that {{commanding}} eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the situation, <b>Druse</b> now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and, glancing through the sights, covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter <b>Druse.</b> At that instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his brave, compassionate heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot exactly {{tell you}} his name," [...] said the consul. [...] "Prince Galitzin brought him here, and thought highly of him. I {{believe he is}} one of the old Syrian {{families}} in the mountain; but whether he be a Maronite or a <b>Druse,</b> or any thing else, I really cannot say. Now try the sherbet." ...|$|E
6000|$|The credulous air of Syria was {{favourable}} to {{the great}} mystification in which Lord Montacute was an unconscious agent. It was as fully believed in the mountain, by all the Habeishes and the Eldadahs, the Kazins and the Elvasuds, the Elheires, and the Hai-dars, great Maronite families, {{as well as by}} the <b>Druse</b> Djinblats and their rivals, the House of Yezbeck, or the House of Talhook, or the House of Abuneked, that the brother of the Queen of England was a guest at Canobia as it was in the stony wilderness of Petrsea. Ahmet Raslan the <b>Druse</b> and Butros Kerauney the Maronite, who agreed upon no other point, were resolved on this. And was it wonderful, for Butros had already received privately two hundred muskets since the arrival of Tancred, and Raslan had been promised in confidence a slice of the impending English loan by Fakredeen? ...|$|E
6000|$|Hence arose {{the terms}} of mixed Druses and mixed Christians; mixed Druses meaning Druses living in the Christian country, and mixed Christians those living in the <b>Druse</b> country. Such was {{the origin of the}} mixed {{population}} question, which entirely upset the project of Downing Street; happy spot, where they draw up constitutions for Syria and treaties for China with the same self-complacency and the same success! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And mighty things your Maronite {{nation has}} done!' rejoined Francis El Kazin. 'If {{there had been}} the Syrian nation instead of the Maronite nation, and the <b>Druse</b> nation, and half a dozen other nations besides, instead of being conquered by Egypt in 1832, we should have conquered Egypt {{ourselves}} long ago, and have held it for our farm. We have done mighty things truly with our Maronite nation!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How should I {{know your}} mother, Emir of the castles of Lebanon? Have I ever left these mountains, which are dearer {{to me than}} the pyramids of Egypt to the great Pasha? Have I ever looked upon your women, Maronite or <b>Druse,</b> walking in white sheets, {{as if they were}} the {{children}} of ten thousand ghouls; with horns on their heads, {{as if they were the}} wild horses of the desert?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And, {{see what}} men these are!' {{continued}} Fakredeen, with great animation. 'Lebanon can send forth {{more than fifty}} thousand well-armed, and yet let enough stay at home to guard the mulberry trees and the women. Then you can keep them for nothing; a Bedouin is not more temperate than a <b>Druse,</b> if he pleases: he will get through a campaign on olives and cheese; they do not require even tents; they bivouac in a sheepskin.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O! as to that matter, you are lighted on your feet," [...] said Mr. Touchwood; [...] "for {{the time}} present I can fit you. Turk, Arab, Copt, and <b>Druse,</b> I know {{every one of}} them, and can make you as well acquainted with them as myself. Without {{stirring}} a step beyond your threshold, you shall know Syria as well as I do.--But one good turn deserves another--in that case, you must have the goodness to dine with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sleeping}} sentinel in the {{clump of}} laurel {{was a young}} Virginian named Carter <b>Druse.</b> He {{was the son of}} wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of Western Virginia. His home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from the breakfast table and said, quietly but gravely: [...] "Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it." ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the founders of this privileged and {{territorial}} class, whatever may be the present creeds of its members, Moslemin, Maronite, or <b>Druse,</b> were the old Arabian conquerors of Syria. The Turks, conquerors in their turn, have succeeded in some degree in the plain to the estates and immunities of the followers of the first caliphs; but the Ottomans never substantially prevailed in the Highlands, and their authority has been recognised mainly by management, and as a convenient compromise amid the rivalries of so many local ambitions.|$|E
60|$|Fakredeen, {{moving about}} in an immense turban, {{of the most}} {{national}} and unreformed style, and covered with costly shawls and arms flaming with jewels, recognised and welcomed everyone. He accosted <b>Druse</b> and Maronite with equal cordiality, talked much with Said Djinblat, whom he specially wished to gain, and lent one of his choicest steeds to the Djezbek, {{that he might not}} be offended. The Talhook and the Abdel-Malek could not be jealous of the Habeish and the Eldadah. He kissed the hand of Bishop Nicodemus, but then he sent his own nargileh to the Emir Ahmet Raslan, who was Caimacam of the Druses.|$|E
60|$|Is it then {{so terrible}} to kill an enemy in war--an enemy who has {{surprised}} a secret {{vital to the}} safety of one's self and comrades--an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its numbers? Carter <b>Druse</b> grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising, falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion.|$|E
60|$|Exchanging between {{themselves}} glances of contempt at the lords of Lebanon, who were ignorant of what everybody knows, they exhibited the arms {{without the slightest}} interest or anxiety to make the Sheikhs comprehend them; till Tancred, mortified at their brutality, himself interfered, and, having already no inconsiderable knowledge {{of the language of}} the country, though, from his reserve, Fakredeen little suspected the extent of his acquirements, explained felicitously to his companions the process of the arms; and then taking his rifle, and stepping out upon the terrace, he levelled his piece at a heron which was soaring at a distance of upwards of one hundred yards, and brought the bird down amid the applause both of Maronite and <b>Druse.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fakredeen {{was seen}} to great {{advantage}} among his mountains. He was an object of universal regard, and, anxious to maintain the repute {{of which he was}} proud, and which was to be the basis of his future power, it seemed that he was always in a gracious and engaging position. Brilliant, sumptuous, and hospitable, always doing something kind, or saying something that pleased, the Emirs and Sheikhs, both Maronite and <b>Druse,</b> were proud of the princely scion of their greatest house, and hastened to repair to Ca-nobia, where they were welcome to ride any of his two hundred steeds, feast on his flocks, quaff his golden wine of Lebanon, or smoke the delicate tobaccos of his celebrated slopes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Druse</b> {{withdrew his}} eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: [...] "Whatever may occur, do what you {{conceive}} to be your duty." [...] He was calm now. His teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the body: [...] "Peace, be still." [...] He fired.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Fakredeen {{proposed}} to himself two objects: the first was, {{to bring together}} the principal chiefs of the mountain, both Maronite and <b>Druse,</b> and virtually to carry into effect at Ca-nobia that reconciliation between the two races which had been formally effected at Beiroot, in the preceding month of June, by the diplomatic interference of the Great Powers, and through the signature of certain articles of peace to which we have alluded. His second object was to increase his already considerable influence with these personages, by exhibiting to them, as his guest and familiar friend, an English prince, whose presence could only {{be accounted for by}} duties too grave for ordinary envoys, and who was understood to represent, in their fullest sense, the wealth and authority of the richest and most potent of nations.|$|E
6000|$|Came slowly, on steeds dark as night, up {{the winding}} steep of Canobia, {{with a company}} of twenty men on foot armed with muskets and handjars, the two ferocious {{brothers}} Abuneked, Nasif and Hamood. Pale is the cheek of the daughters of Maron at the fell name of Abuneked. The Abunekeds were the <b>Druse</b> lords {{of the town of}} Deir el Kamar, where the majority of the inhabitants were Christian. When the patriarch tried to deprive the Druses of their feudal rights, the Abunekeds attacked and sacked their own town of Deir el Kamar. The civil war being terminated, and it being agreed, in the settlement of the indemnities from the Druses to the Maronites, that all plunder still in possession of the plunderers should be restored, Nasif Abuneked said, 'I have five hundred silver horns, and each of them I took from the head of a Christian woman. Come and fetch them.' ...|$|E
60|$|And the <b>Druse</b> {{chief of}} the House of Djezbek, who for five hundred years had never yielded {{precedence}} to the House of Djinblat, and Sheikh Fahour Kangé, who since the civil war had never smoked a pipe with a Maronite, but who now gave the salaam of peace to the crowds of Habeishs and Dahdahes who passed by; and Butros Keramy, the nephew of the patriarch, himself a great Sheikh, who inhaled his nargileh as he rode, and who looked to the skies and puffed forth his smoke whenever he met a son of Eblis; and the House of Talhook, and the House of Abdel-Malek and a swarm of Elvasuds, and Elheires, and El Dahers, Emirs and Sheikhs on their bounding steeds, and musketeers on foot, with their light jackets and bare legs and wooden sandals, and black slaves, carrying vases and tubes; everywhere a brilliant and animated multitude, and all mounting the winding steep of Canobia.|$|E
60|$|Now {{this was}} the reason that induced Tancred to inquire of Baroni {{respecting}} the Ansarey. The day before, which was {{the third day of}} the great hunting party at Canobia, Fakredeen and Tancred had found themselves alone with Hamood Abuneked, and the lord of Canobia had thought it a good occasion to sound this powerful Sheikh of the Druses. Hamood was rough, but frank and sincere. He was no enemy of the House of Shehaab; but the Abunekeds had suffered during the wars and civil conflicts which had of late years prevailed in Lebanon, and he was evidently disinclined to mix in any movement which was not well matured and highly promising of success. Fakredeen, of course, concealed his ulterior purpose from the <b>Druse,</b> who associated with the idea of union between the two nations merely the institution of a sole government under one head, and that head a Shehaab, probably dwelling at Canobia.|$|E
60|$|After {{confectionery}} {{which had}} been prepared by nuns, and strong waters {{which had been}} distilled by the hands of priors, the chieftains praised God, and rose, and took their seats on the divan, when immediately advanced a crowd of slaves, each bearing a nargileh, which they presented to the guests. Then gradually the conversation commenced. It was entirely confined to the exploits of the day, which had been rich in the heroic feats of forest huntsmen. There had been wild boars, too, as brave as their destroyers; some slight wounds, some narrow escapes. Sheikh Said Djinblat inquired of Lord Montacute whether there were hyenas in England, but was immediately answered by the lively and well-informed Kais Shehaab, who apprised him that there were only lions and unicorns. Bishop Nicodemus, who watched the current of observations, began telling hunting stories {{of the time of}} the Emir Bescheer, when that prince resided at his splendid castle of Bteddeen, near Deir el Kamar. This was to recall the days when the mountain had only one ruler, and that ruler a Shehaab, and when the <b>Druse</b> lords were proud to be classed among his most faithful subjects.|$|E
