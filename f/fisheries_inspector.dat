40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of minimum mesh sizes to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by <b>fishery</b> <b>inspectors</b> using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the <b>fishery</b> <b>inspectors</b> will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, <b>fisheries</b> <b>inspectors</b> and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R

During the sixtees, fishing had been by primitive methods of harpooning, confined to the lagoon and reef areas.

50|$|Whitfield was a {{crayfish}} trader {{charged with}} the unlawful possession of undersized crayfish. He resided in Tasmania, but the fish were purchased in South Australia and shipped to Tasmania. Under South Australian state's law, the fish that he purchased were of a lawful size, but under Tasmanian laws, they were undersize. The Fisheries Act 1959, empowered the Governor of Tasmania to make regulations relating {{to a number of}} subjects, one of which was the classification of undersized fish. The Sea Fisheries Regulations 1962 outlawed catching male crayfish less than 11 cm and female crayfish less than 10.5 cm in length. Cole, a <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Inspector,</b> charged Whitfield with a breach of the regulations. Whitfield pleaded not guilty and argued that section 92 protected the freedom of his interstate trade. The magistrate dismissed the complaint. Cole appealed to the Supreme Court of Tasmania however the case was removed to the High Court for determination of the constitutional question.|$|E
50|$|The water ways in Hamilton {{have not}} always been polluted. The north-end of the Harbour used to be a regular {{swimming}} spot for working-class families. The pollution of Hamilton Harbour water ways is caused by industrialization and, by proxy, urbanization, which came to be a major problem by 1917. Many working-class families were overcome by health hazards when dumping sewage into the inlets and the bay itself became a regular occurrence. Laurel Sefton MacDowell writes in her book An Environmental History of Canada that, “As early as the 1860s, a <b>fishery</b> <b>inspector</b> at Hamilton Harbour discovered that fish found along the shore tasted of coal oil and that dead ducks and muskrats were coated with oil from two refineries.” By the 1950s, city officials had deemed Hamilton Harbour unfit for any recreation use and shut down all beaches.|$|R

After a brief stint at the Station zoologique d'Endoumes at Marseille he then worked for three years at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Nevertheless, E. W. L.

In 1899, he returned to Ireland, taking charge of the Saturn and her four small auxiliary sailing boats used for sampling. The floating laboratory was stationed in the Connemara district in County Galway; it lay at Ballynakill in winter and was towed to Inishbofin for the summer months. In 1900, the Saturn was transferred to the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

Our inspections of catches {{over the last few years}} have shown that, for some species, fish resources are falling.

[] Our analyses have shown that local boats are breaking the law more often than other boats because they are not kept under proper surveillance. It is time to deal with this situation, which is crying out for correction. At present, it is Senegalese boats which are plundering the waters of Senegal, and not foreign boats as many people think. What's more, we have to harmonise our fishery legislation within our sub-region (Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal).

This is the initial act of modern salmon legislation, which provides funds and machinery for carrying the law into practice, by making the local administration of the salmon acts self-supporting. He now became a commissioner at the Office of Public Works for the superintendence of the newly formed fishery districts. In 1853 he exhibited working models of salmon passes at the Dublin exhibition of that year, which attracted general attention.

40|$|Passive nets are {{currently}} {{among the most}} important fishing gears largely used along the Mediterranean coasts by the small scale fisheries sector. The fishing effort exerted by this sector is strongly correlated with net dimensions. Therefore, the use of passive nets is worldwide managed by defining net length and net drop. The EC Reg. 1967 / 2006 reports that the length of bottom-set and drifting nets may be also defined considering their weight or volume; however, no practical suggestions for <b>fisheries</b> <b>inspectors</b> are yet available. Consequently,  even if such technical measures are reasonable from a theoretical viewpoint, they are hardly suitable as a management tool, due to the difficulties in harbour control. The overall objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a quick methodological approach for the gross estimation of passive net length (by net type) on the basis of net volume. The final goal is to support fisheries managers with suitable advice for enforcement and control purposes. The results obtained are important for the management of the fishing effort exerted by small scale fisheries. The methodology developed in this study should be considered as a first attempt to tackle the tangled problem of net length estimation that can be easily applied in other fisheries and areas in order to improve the precision of the models developed herein...|$|R

The concept of Peace Journalism has provided the theoretical framework. By doing a media analysis through the lenses of Peace Journalism, as well as interviews with persons of both nationalities, I have examined representations of Russians and {{the relationship between the two}} states. The analysis shows that most news articles frame Russians in a neutral way. This indicates that the media aims for balanced reporting. However, most articles do not fulfill the criteria of Peace Journalism. The sources, editors and news contributors are almost exclusively male elites. There is a lack of investigation into structural causes of the problem with illegal fishing, and almost no evidence of a win-win orientation or creative suggestions to conflict solution. In addition, the interviews show that there is mutual mistrust and conflicting interests between Norwegians and Russians. This suggests that the states have a negative peace rather than a positive peace. But the interviewees also stress the importance of the long lasting, and successful, joint management of the fisheries in the Barents Sea...|$|R
