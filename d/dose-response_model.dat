40|$|Copper (Cu) and its alloys {{are used}} {{extensively}} in domestic and industrial applications. Cu {{is also an}} essential element in mammalian nutrition. Since both copper deficiency and copper excess produce adverse health effects, the dose-response curve is U-shaped, although the precise form {{has not yet been}} well characterized. Many animal and human studies were conducted on copper to provide a rich database from which data suitable for <b>modeling</b> the <b>dose-response</b> relationship for copper may be extracted. Possible <b>dose-response</b> <b>modeling</b> strategies are considered in this review, including those based on the benchmark dose and categorical regression. The usefulness of biologically based <b>dose-response</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques in understanding copper toxicity was difficult to assess at this time since the mechanisms underlying copper-induced toxicity have yet to be fully elucidated. A <b>dose-response</b> <b>modeling</b> strategy for copper toxicity was proposed associated with both deficiency and excess. This modeling strategy was applied to multiple studies of copper-induced toxicity, standardized with respect to severity of adverse health outcomes and {{selected on the basis of}} criteria reflecting the quality and relevance of individual studies. The use of a comprehensive database on copper-induced toxicity is essential for <b>dose-response</b> <b>modeling</b> since there is insufficient information in any single study to adequately characterize copper dose-response relationships. The <b>dose-response</b> <b>modeling</b> strategy envisioned here is designed to determine whether the existing toxicity data for copper excess or deficiency may be effectively utilized in defining the limits of the homeostatic range in humans and other species. By considering alternative techniques for determining a point of departure and low-dose extrapolation (including categorical regression, the benchmark dose, and identification of observed no-effect levels) this strategy will identify which techniques are most suitable for this purpose. This analysis also serves to identify areas in which additional data are needed to better define the characteristics of dose-response relationships for copper-induced toxicity in relation to excess or deficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{biomedical}} community made {{a fundamental}} error {{on the nature}} of the dose-response relationship early in the 20 th century and has perpetuated this error to the present. The error was the byproduct of the conflict between homeopathy and traditional medicine. To deny support to homeopathy, leaders of the biomedical community rejected the hormetic biphasic <b>dose-response</b> <b>model,</b> the proposed explanatory principle of homeopathy. The threshold <b>dose-response</b> <b>model</b> was adopted as an alternative model, quickly becoming central to toxi-cology/pharmacology and their numerous applications. Despite its near-universal acceptance, no attempt was made to validate the ability of the threshold model to accurately predict responses in the below-threshold zone at the time of acceptance and throughout the 20 th century. In contrast, the hormetic biphasic <b>dose-response</b> <b>model</b> became marginalized and was excluded from the mainstream of pharma-cological/toxicological teaching and practice, textbook development, professional society journal publications, annual meeting presentations, grant funding, and use in government risk assessment.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} {{and compare}} the secondary cancer risk (SCR) due to para-aortic (PA), dogleg field (DLF), or extensive field (EF) radiotherapy (RT) at different dose levels for Stage I testicular seminoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The organ equivalent dose concept with a linear, plateau, and linear-exponential <b>dose-response</b> <b>model</b> {{was applied to the}} dose distributions to estimate the SCR. The dose distributions were calculated in a voxel-based anthropomorphic phantom. Three different three-dimensional plans were computed: PA, DLF, and EF. The plans were calculated with 6 -MV photons and two opposed fields, using 20 Gy in 10 fractions. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative SCR for a 75 -year-old patient treated with PA-RT at age 35 was 23. 3 % (linear model), 20. 9 % (plateau model), and 20. 8 % (linear-exponential model) compared with 19. 8 % for the general population. Dependent on the model, PA-RT compared with DLF-RT reduced the SCR by 48 - 63 % or 64 - 69 % when normalized to EF-RT. For PA-RT, the linear <b>dose-response</b> <b>model</b> predicted a decrease of 45 % in the SCR, using 20 Gy instead of 30 Gy; the linear-exponential <b>dose-response</b> <b>model</b> predicted no change in SCR. CONCLUSION: Our model suggested that the SCR after PA-RT for Stage I testicular seminoma is reduced by approximately one-half to two-thirds compared with DLF-RT, independent of the <b>dose-response</b> <b>model.</b> The SCR is expected to be equal or lower with 20 Gy than with 30 Gy.

High levels of ionizing radiation have been associated with a risk of radiation-induced soft tissue sarcomas following therapeutic or occupational exposures.

This study was a longitudinal, cohort-based analysis of the development of soft tissue sarcomas in 80, 181 atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki followed from 1958 to 2001. Utilizing colon dose in Gray (Gy), the excess relative risk (ERR) per Gy of ionizing radiation absorbed dose was assessed. Various subject demographics, age-specificity, and survival parameters were also assessed. The study identified 105 soft tissue sarcomas (36 males, 69 females). The mean ages {{at the time of the}} bombings and diagnosis were 27. 0 and 63. 6 years, respectively. The mean colon dose was 18 cGy.

It {{is one of}} the most widely {{distributed}} flea-borne diseases with a relatively mild febrile initial illness with six to 14 days of incubation period. The bacterium is gram negative and an obligate intracellular pathogen. The disease is transmitted to humans and vertebrate host through fleabites or via contact with infected feces. This paper develops <b>dose-response</b> <b>models</b> of different routes of exposure for typhus in rodents. Methods Data from published articles were analyzed using parametric <b>dose-response</b> relationship <b>models.</b> <b>Dose-response</b> relationships were fit to data using the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Results <b>Dose-response</b> <b>models</b> quantifying the effects of different ages of rats and time post inoculation in BALB/c mice were analyzed in the study. Both the adult rats (inoculated intradermally) and newborn rats (inoculated subcutaneously) were best fit by exponential models and both distributions could be described by a single dose-response relationship. The BALB/C mice inoculated subcutaneously were best fit by Beta-Poisson models. The time post inoculation analysis showed that there was a definite time and response relationship existed in this case.
