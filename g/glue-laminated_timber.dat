40|$|The weak {{mechanical}} properties of wood in tension {{perpendicular to the}} grain are often the origin of catastrophic brittle failure. In order to enhance the tension strength {{perpendicular to the grain}} and achieve a more ductile failure, flax fiber and glass fiber-reinforced polymer FRP composites were used to strengthen <b>glue-laminated</b> glulam <b>timber</b> specimens. Three series of specimen of glulam timber flax fiber reinforced, glass fiber reinforced, and unreinforced, with a grand total of 28 specimens, were tested in tension perpendicular to the grain. For an approximate amount of FRP reinforcement of 1. 2 % in volume thickness of 0. 7 mm, an increase of the tensile strength of up to 74 % was shown, with a stiffness increase of up to 41 %. For all reinforced specimens, semiductile failures were observed. A parametric study was carried out using both the Monte Carlo MC method and the first-order second moment FOSM method. It is shown that the mean values obtained during experiments are in agreement with those from the MC simulation. However, the standard deviations from the MC simulation are larger. From the FOSM analysis, it is demonstrated that the variation in glulam stiffness perpendicular to the grain is not the first parameter driving the variation for the reinforced system.

40|$|Post-tensioned timber joints {{have been}} studied at the,nstitute of Structural Engineering at the ETH =urich. A {{post-tensioned}} beam-column timber joint has been developed using glued laminated timber with local hardwood reinforcement. 2 nly a single straight tendon {{is placed in the}} middle of the beam and post-tensioned to restrain the rotation of the joint. 1 o additional steel elements are used. The developed joint is characterised by a high degree of pre-fabrication and easy assembly on site. The <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber</b> moment-resisting frame featuring this joint shows great potential for timber frame structures especially for multi-storey buildings. Robust performance-based design criteria are a necessity for a s uccessful market implementation of the proposed system. A simplified analytical model was developed in order to predict the structural performance of the post-tensioned timber connection and facilitate preliminary performance-based design. This model was implemented in 2 penSees using a bi-linear rotational spring approach. The model was verified against an analytical model and validated against tests on a post-tensioned timber joints under gravity loading and under horizontal loading. Moreover, a complex numerical model was developed using 2 penSees to check the accuracy of the proposed preliminary design model. The preliminary design model was used to design fictitious moment-resisting post-tensioned <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber</b> frame structures using the loads prescribed in the Swiss code. The design process showed that neither the gravity loads nor the seismic load controlled the design. The design was governed by the lateral deformations due to wind. Based on this finding it is recommended to focus further research on increasing the connection stiffness or on adding additional structural elements to address the seismic performance of post-tensioned timber frames in regions of high seismicity...|$|E

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of non-Korean-Standard glulam in structural applications. Allowable stresses determined by both hand-calculation and Monte-Carlo simulation show a higher allowable stress than that of the KS-standard glulam of 6 S- 22 B. In the Korean Standard (KS), knot characteristics are not taken into account. Japanese cedar has relatively small knots. We believe that the small knots in Japanese cedar contribute to a higher allowable stress than the KS-standard glulam would predict.

Bamboo is a rapidly renewable material that can be harvested every 4 - 5 years. The round culm can either be used as is or it can be processed into a variety of laminated products. Engineered bamboo is currently promoted as a structural alternative to timber and <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber,</b> but also has potential in shell applications. In contrast to short fibre composites, engineered bamboo maintains fibre length and continuity within the raw material for exceptional mechanical properties. The composite section results in a high strength material in compression and tension, with bending properties comparable to timber products. The inherent flexibility of the material has advantages in comparison to timber, allowing for complex designs to be achieved. The present work explores the substitution of engineered bamboo in existing gridshells with a comparison to the original timber structure.

30|$|Wood, and wood-based {{materials}} and their ingredients, i.e., adhesives, are often presented as {{major sources of}} acetaldehyde in dwellings [11, 12]. Their contribution to indoor acetaldehyde concentration {{is estimated to be}} larger than that from smoking or drinking alcohol indoors [13]. Yagi et al. [14] reported a large acetaldehyde emission factor of 535  μg/m 2  h from laminated lumber using the small chamber method. Tohmura et al. [15, 16] revealed that the addition of ethanol to adhesives causes significant emissions of acetaldehyde from <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber,</b> and that acetaldehyde was generated by an enzymatic process of alcohol dehydrogenase contained within wood tissue. Although most cases of acetaldehyde emission from wood-based materials are relatively small [3] and unlikely engaged with ethanol addition to adhesives, acetaldehyde emissions from wood-based materials can still affect indoor air quality [11]. The behavior of acetaldehyde emissions from wood-based materials in residential environment remains unclear. Knowledge of the emission behaviors of building {{materials and}} the influencing factors would be helpful for estimating and reducing indoor air pollution. Specially, panel-shaped wood-based materials are usually used for interior finishing materials in dwellings and have larger emission area in indoor spaces. They could have larger influence in indoor air quality than beam-shaped materials such as glued laminated timber. However, the properties of acetaldehyde emission from panel-shaped wood-based materials have not been understood well enough. Therefore, in this study, the effects of time, temperature, and humidity on acetaldehyde emission from wood-based materials such as particleboards, fiber boards and plywood were examined using the small chamber method.|$|E
40|$|After a brief {{introduction}} on {{the importance}} of poplar for both the environment and the wood-industry system, the current common uses of poplar wood are discussed, with particular reference to the production of plywood, which {{is by far the most}} important and remunerative destination for the best raw material resulting from intensive poplar cultivation. Plywood can be considered a “mature ” product both in terms of development (efficiency levels, yields and productivity) and of market (at the moment plywood is also suffering from the competition of new kinds of panels). From a technical point of view, possible innovations are strictly related to the ability to find new uses and new products, possibly with value added figures. In this frame, the building sector seems to offer new possibilities, also thanks to the renewed interest for wood and wood-based products. Another possible destination for poplar wood could be the production of <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber.</b> A quite complete research was done in Italy on this subject, which included the possibility of mixing poplar with other species (in particular eucalypt and larch). Details are given on the results obtained. In the building sector, beyond the possibility of using purposely-produced plywood, Poplar wood could also be a very good raw-material for the production of “engineered panels ” (LVL, OSB). In conclusion, poplar wood is surely suitable also for use in other sectors. The reliability of products (with improved properties, if necessary) and their ecological characteristics, together with the preparation of updated technical information, are, in any case, among the main factors that can guarantee an increase of the use of poplar wood in non-traditional applications...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the idea of a timber short {{procurement}} chain as a means to provide an increased value to Mediterranean forests. It is based on the evidence that timber buildings are increasingly used for a number of reasons including sustainability, the speed of erection, and excellent structural and seismic performance. However, most of the timber currently used around the Mediterranean is imported from outside this area. Materials and Methods: The idea is to use the best part of the tree to produce timber boards, while all the remaining part of the tree including the production waste is used for energy production. Important issues to address are the generally low mechanical properties of locally-grown timber such as maritime pine in Sardinia, which would make some wood-based products such as <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber</b> not technically viable. Cross-laminated timber panels are a possible solution to this problem because this wood-based product is manufactured in such a way that even with low-quality timber boards it is possible to obtain a medium quality panel. The panel is made of layers of timber boards with the adjacent layers glued under pressure at a right angle. Another issue is the need to grade the local timber, for which a number of specimens must be tested to destruction in order to identify a visual or a machine-stress grading procedure. Last but not least, the panels must be tested to destruction to correlate their mechanical properties to the properties of the boards. Results: The preliminary mechanical tests carried out on Sardinia maritime pine confirm that the material is low-grade because it is characterized by large knots and a significant grain deviation. Nevertheless, when used in the cross-laminated panels, the properties are significantly improved due to the layout of the panel which reduces the influence of defects in the boards on the mechanical properties of the panel. Conclusions: A timber short procurement chain is a possible means to create job opportunities and reduce depopulation, which is particularly important in several regions of the Mediterranean. By adding value to the forests by means of timber production used in prefabricated components employed in low-rise timber buildings, it is also possible to improve forest management and even extend forested areas which have all positive effects on the environment, the landscape and the reduction of hydrogeological hazard...|$|E
40|$|For years, the {{reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions have been a global goal, and {{in the recent years}} this has led to an increased focus on emissions from the construction industry as well. With timber being an environmental-friendly building material, the focus on the environment has led to the construction of a number of minor timber bridges in Norway the past years. This master thesis looks at the possibility of constructing long span network arch bridges in <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber.</b> The thesis presents two structural alternatives and compare these with a network arch bridge in steel and concrete, Driva Bridge. The primary focus has been on the structures stability, cost and feasibility. The bridge span is 111 meters for all three bridges. Alternative 1 : A network arch bridge without wind bracing between arches. Instead, the bridge has hangers with an out-of-plane angle relative to the arch to create sideways stability. One of the reasons for this is to avoid connections {{on the side of the}} arches, which are more vulnerable for weather damage. The arches have a massive glulam cross-section with moment resistant splice joints. The arches cross-section is 1600 x 850 mm 2. The hangers are connected to the transverse beams, thus having an equidistant distribution on the lower chord. The transverse steel beams support the stress laminated timber deck. The bridge has no ties, and is therefore relying on the foundation to absorb the horizontal forces at the support. Alternative 2 : A network arch bridge with the same design as Driva Bridge. The bridge has glue-laminated K-shaped wind bracings for sideways stability. The arches have a massive glulam cross-section varying from 1100 x 1100 mm 2 to 850 x 850 mm 2. The bridge deck is the same as for alternative 1. The transverse beams and the hangers are connected to box-profile steel ties. The hangers have an equidistant distribution on the arch. Structural analyses has been carried out on numerical models in the FEM-software Abaqus CAE, and Focus Konstruksjoner. Design checks have been carried out after relevant Eurocodes and design manuals. Rough cost estimates have been made on the bridge alternatives to find out if they are cost competetive with Driva Bridge. The cost data used are based on previous projects, actual costs on Driva Bridge and budget prices provided from manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|The {{turnover}} {{of the companies}} in North Savo in 2011 was nearly 10 billion euros, of which industry accounted for just under a third. The industrial structure of the region is not strong, {{but on the other}} hand it is not alarmingly thin either, because it does have certain successful niches. North Savo's production and export growth has been on par with the average of other regions. The region is specialized in forestry and machinery industries as well as food production. The forest and machinery industries are export-oriented. Promising growth businesses include biopharmaceutical research, testing and production. These segments will be the engines of growth for the region in the future. In the forest industry the wood products industry is strong and its special products, such as heat treated wood, <b>glue-laminated</b> <b>timber</b> and hardwood floors, are selling well. Pulp and paper production have suffered losses, but the carton is in demand. In the machinery industry, power plant boilers, forestry tractors and mining machinery are global successes. Their production networks include a considerable number of local sub-contractors. Counterflow strategies will be the key to future development. The forest industry will evolve into a biotechnology industry, where decentralized local bio-oil production instead of large plants will play a large role. Clusters can be built around wooden apartment buildings. The key skills of the machinery industry should be kept as Savo's own secret, but the network of services and output should go global. In addition to timber, milk is one of the region's precious raw materials, the production of which should be safeguarded in the future. Research can facilitate processing of milk and timber into more lucrative products with higher value-added. Fresh, local and organic food production can be promoted via entrepreneurial training, product development, and use of competitive bidding in purchases of fresh food products by public institutions. Development of the pharmaceutical industry is following a dual strategy: the development of the biopharmaceutical industry is based on synergies and investing in research, entrepreneurship and the raising of risk capital. Neighbouring Russia is investing in the development of its pharmaceutical industry. Kuopio's medical cluster could participate by helping in the development of medicines, approval process, manufacturing and packaging, as well as marketing to Western markets. Industrial development requires close-knit co-operation with government departments. The University of Eastern Finland, the Savonia University of Applied Sciences, vocational schools, research institutes and laboratories, Kuopio University Hospital and the Finnish Medicines Agency as well as authorities responsible for business development and funding are key players is this development...|$|E

On selected standing trees, based on measurements taken at different heights, the first preliminary grading was applied by sorting for structural and energy use. 2) Trees were harvested by a local company and the logs were finally assorted based on their size and their external defects. 3) The logs were then transported to the local sawmill, where different boards size required to build the grading rules and to produce the CLT panels were cut. Each board was then subjected to a non-destructive measurement of the Modulus of Elasticity using acoustic tool for measuring stress wave velocity (Viscan-Microtec) 4). After kiln drying, the required boards (approximately 840) were subjected to non-destructive measurements of their physical properties (density, humidity, defects etc.) using the machine purposely developed by Microtec. The aim was the calibration of this machine in order to enable the machine strength grading of Sardinia maritime pine. 5) The required boards were visually characterized and then tested to destruction in order to measure their strength and correlate this values to the presence of defects such as knot diameters and positions, grain deviations, etc. 6) Based on the results of phases 4 and 5, the visual and machine based grading rule for Sardinia Maritime Pine have been developed. 7) By applying the newly developed grading rules, some boards 5 have been selected among the available ones and used for the production of some prototypes of CLT panels. 8) In order to determine the structural performance, 68 panel have been tested to destruction. Testing was carried out in accordance with EN 408 on specimens with a span to depth ratio equal to 18 to determine the bending strength and stiffness, and on specimens with span to depth ratio equal to 9 to determine the shear strength. A number of different methods exist for the analysis and design of CLT elements, including the Shear Analogy Method and the Mechanically Jointed Beams Theory (Gamma Method). These methods have been considered in this study and a relative comparison have been presented in order to determine which method is most suitable when considering CLT formed using Sardinian grown timber [...] Results: It was found that Maritime Pine as structural material is limited by stiffness rather than strength or density. The effective bending stiffness of CLT is a measure of the material stiffness in relation to the cross sectional build-up of the panel. To be competitive on the market, a Sardinian CLT product will have to compete with imported CLT panels, which are usually made from C 24 graded material (spruce). In most cases this is simply because the C 24 material is widely available on the market rather than a specification from the designer. The performance of panels made of Maritime Pine boards has been compared directly with that of imported products, demonstrating that an increase in the Sardinian panel depth of just 15...|$|E
