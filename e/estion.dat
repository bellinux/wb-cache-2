40|$|A key {{question}} of theoretical ecology is which properties of ecosystems favour their stability and help maintaining biodiversity. This qu <b>estion</b> recently reconsid- ered mutualistic systems, generating intense controversy {{about the role}} of mutu- alistic interactions and their network architecture. Here we show analytically and verify with simulations that reducing the effective intersp ecific competition and the propagation of perturbations positively influences struct ural stability against envi- ronmental perturbations, enhancing persistence. Notewor thy, mutualism reduces the effective interspecific competition only when the direct interspecific competition is weaker than a critical value. This critical competition i s in almost all cases larger in pollinator networks than in random networks with the same connectance. Highly connected mutualistic networks reduce the propagation of e nvironmental perturba- tions, a mechanism reminiscent of MacArthur???s proposal tha t ecosystem complexity enhances stability. Our analytic framework rationalizes p revious contradictory re- sults, and it gives valuable insight on the complex relation ship between mutualism and biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a {{connection}} oriented end-end reliable byte stream transport layer protocol. It is widely used in the Internet. TCP is fine tuned to perform well in wired networks. However the performance degrades in mobile ad hoc networks.

40|$|The {{solution}} chemistry {{during the}} initial (slow increase of dissolved iron and sulfate) and main stage (rapid increase of dissolved iron and sulfate) of pyrite leaching by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Af) at a starting pH of 2. 05 shows significant differences. During the initial stage, ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) is the dominant iron species in solution and the molar ratio of produced sulfate (SO 4 2 -) and total iron (Fe tot) is 1. 1, thus {{does not reflect the}} stoichiometry of pyrite (FeS 2). During the main stage, ferric iron (Fe 3 +) is the dominant iron species in solution and the SO 4 2 - :Fe tot ratio is with 1. 9, close to the stoichiometry of FeS 2. Another difference between initial and main stage is an initial trend to slightly higher pH values followed by a drop during the main stage to pH 1. 84. These observations raise the qu <b>estion</b> if there are different modes of bioleaching of pyrite, and if there are, what those modes imply in terms of leaching mechanisms. Different oxygen and sulfur isotope trends of sulfate {{during the initial}} and main stages of pyrite oxidation confirm that there are two pyrite bioleaching modes. The biochemical reactions during initial stage are best explained by the net reaction FeS 2 + 3 O 2 ⇒ Fe 2 + + SO 4 2 - + SO 2 (g). The degassing of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) acts as sink for sulfur depleted in 34 S compared to pyrite, and is the cause of the SO 4 2 - :Fe tot ratio of 1. 1 and the near constant pH. During the exponential phase, pyrite sulfur is almost quantitatively converted to sulfate, according to the net reaction FeS 2 + 15 / 4 O 2 + 1 / 2 H 2 O ⇒ Fe 3 + + 2 SO 4 2 - + H +. We hypothesize that the transition between the modes of bioleaching of pyrite is due to the impact of the accumulation of ferrous iron, which induces changes in the metabolic activity of Af and may act as an inhibitor for the oxidation of sulfur species. This transition defines a fundamental change in the growth strategy of Af. A mode, where bacteria gain energy by oxidation of elemental sulfur to sulfite but show little growth is switched into a mode, where bacteria gain a smaller amount of energy by the oxidation of ferrous iron, but induce much faster pyrite leaching rates due to the production of ferric iron. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Venereal {{diseases}} (VD) {{have always}} {{been associated with the}} idea of sin, yet from the late 19 th century, these pathologies gradually emerged und er a new light in western societies as a collective health threat, succe eding a long tradition in which venereal disease infection was merely se en as a self-inflicted punishment for committed vice. This historical-so ciological study explores the ways Belgian society dealt with sexually t ransmitted diseases, in particular syphilis and AIDS, as a public health problem in the period 1880 - 2000. As effective medical treatment covered {{only a small part of}} the period 1880 - 2000 - only after WWII could penic illin be used by doctors as a 'magic bullet' against sexually trans mitted diseases (STDs) -the public health campaigns against syphilis and AIDS were the major expressions of how Belgian society reacted to STDs in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This study aims to make an original contribution to historical and socio logical research into public health in at least two ways. Firstly, it pr ovides a more complex and nuanced reading of the history of STD preventi on than the few studies that generally have drawn parallels between AIDS and former VD history in rudimentary, theoretically inaccurate and cont radictory ways. Secondly, it discusses the utility of the medicalisation thesis, which presents itself today as a hegemonic model in medical soc iological literature, for explaining the changing social reactions regar ding STDs over time. It is often assumed that the problem of STDs was su bject to a gradual process of medicalisation, in which initial, strong m oral beliefs regarding STDs in society gradually gave way to a more scie ntific and less moralistic approach to STDs. Following this thesis, the cultural status of STDs gradually moved from a physical punishment for c ommitted sin to an infectious disease that was included in preventive an d curative health care, like had been the case for other, less tabooed d iseases, in earlier times. However, a theoretical discussion of the medicalisation concept in Chapt er 1 reveals its conceptual limits. First of all, medicalisation theorie s are merely focused on the extension and growing influence of mainstrea m curative medicine, performed by legally certified physicians, excludin g alternative, more marginal types of medical knowledge and disease mode ls, or domains that are not concerned with the treatment of patients suc h as prevention and public health policy. Therefore, I adopted the socia l worlds/arenas model, developed by symbolic interactionists like Anselm Strauss and Adele Clarke, as a more flexible, conceptual device to map the variety of concerned parties, discourses and practices that were imp licated in the fight against STDs beyond the clinical setting. Another important drawback of medicalisation theories is that they generally pa y little attention to issues of individual agency and the regulation of the behaviour of larger populations in relation to the social fight agai nst diseases. Drawing on neo-Foucauldian literature on governmentality, I focused on the historical-specific ideas and strategies for governi ng the behaviours of populations and the self in relation to the proble m of STDs. In doing so, I was able to explore more thoroughly how the qu <b>estion</b> of STDs was connected with contemporary issues of public governme nt and sexual regulation. The historical evidence analysed in Chapters 2 to 9 reveals that what we today call STD 'prevention' significantly differed from how preven tion was conceived in earlier periods. In each of the three distinguishe d periods 1880 - 1914, 1914 - 1950, and 1982 - 2000 contemporary ideas and pra ctices with respect to STDs relied on distinctive explanatory medical-so cial theories on the biological and social conditions of STD transmissio n in society as well as on contemporary ideas about the best ways to int ervene in the targeted populations. Overviewing these different periods, it is clear that in the period of 1880 - 2000 the cultural definition of STDs changed from a physical punishment for committed sin to an infectio us disease. Yet, attributing this transformation to a progressive medica lisation of the problem of STDs would be a gross simplification. Instead, the observed shift should be understood as the result of interrelated changes in the domains of medicine, public health policy and sexual mora lity, which were articulated and negotiated at specific historical momen ts by committed social worlds in a contemporary arena. Three major evolu tions are crucial to understand this cultural transformation. Firstly, d octors could more easily and more exclusively define the STD problem in the public sphere over time, while at the same time, also other groups o f moral/social reformers and professionals were more eager to follow thi s medical definition. Secondly, explanatory theories of STD infection ha ve went through an enormous evolution in which the problem shifted from immoral 'types' of infected people to more abstract risk patterns o f behaviour in society as a whole. Concomitantly, public health measures against STDs individualised and became more comprehensive and fine-tune d over time, fundamentally switching from strategies of coercion to stra tegies of persuasion and education. Thirdly, changes in the public manag ement of STDs should also be understood against the backdrop of a progre ssing detraditionalisation of sexual regulation. Finally, I make a plea for the notion of the socialisation o f medicine as a better alternative for the medicalisation concept in or der to understand the observed social changes with respect to STDs. With this notion, the focus of analysis shifts from the biomedical model tha t is spread in an unaltered way as an ultimate, scientific truth in cont emporary society to the historically situated processes of translation through which medical notions with respect to STDs became useful in an increasing number of non-clinical, i. e. social settings. status: publishe...|$|E

Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Australia during 2012. Of 1410 respondents, 559 non-HIV-positive men answered qu <b>estions</b> about HST. Results: Men reported reasons for having avoided or delayed HIV testing, most {{of which could be}} broadly categorised as: the inconvenience of current testing procedures; concerns about privacy; and a belief that they had not done anything risky. Over one-third of men (39. 7 %) were aware that HST was available internationally, with 1. 6 % having accessed HST through online purchase. The majority of men in the study indicated that they would be 'likely' (36. 5 %) or 'very likely' (34. 3 %) to use HST if it was available in Australia. Also, 36. 7 % indicated they would test partners they met at sex-on-site venues, and 73. 2 % would test partners with whom they were already acquainted. Nearly half (47. 6 %) indicated that having the capacity to test themselves at home would likely increase their testing frequency. Men who had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse, who were not gay-identified, and who indicated inconvenience issues with using clinic-based HIV testing were more likely to indicate a willingness to use HST. Many men indicated they would be likely to offer HST to at least some of their sex partners. Conclusion: Many GBM who engage in HIV risk behaviours would appreciate HST, and may be encouraged to test more often, as it may alleviate their concerns about testing...|$|R

Participatory budgets are formal procedures for any city all over the world, independent from their size and number of population. The instrument is very flexible and adaptable to different politico-administrative systems and variable political orientations. It's suitable to the current governance trend of local reforms and can be combined with other instruments of local democracy. The idea of including citizens in the local budgetary decision process was invented first in Brazil in the city of Porto Alegre in 1989 under the name Orçamento Participativo. Since then the idea spread over Brazil, other countries of Latin and North America, Asia, Africa and finally Europe. But according to different legal frameworks, varied socio-economical conditions and diverse political intentions of the supporters of participatory budgets the procedure in different countries is highly specific. Therefore, the main research question of this contribution is to find out, how participatory budgets can be adapted to the legal, political and administrative framework condition at local level in Germany. This includes the question of the possible additional benefit of the procedure for local democracy. However, it has been taken into account, that the data about the conditions and results of participatory budgets in Germany are frequently based only on information of the projects organizers. Scientific evaluations of individual projects are still rather rare (with the exception of Berlin-Lichtenberg and Cologne).
