25|$|The {{damage to}} S {{operations}} led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board allowing S {{to sell their}} mortgage loans and use the cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment; the losses created by the sales were to be amortized {{over the life of}} the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years. This all made S eager to sell their loans. The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S were one <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea that}} would {{eventually}} become Groupon {{was born out of}} founder Andrew Mason's frustration trying to cancel a cell phone contract in 2006. Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage large number of people's collective bargaining power. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the [...] "tipping point" [...] principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago, until a group of users decided their cause would be saving money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on <b>group</b> <b>buying.</b> [...] Born from The Point, Groupon was launched in November 2008.|$|E

Intelligent agents have been studied very widely in the field of arti-ficial intelligence and multi-agent systems. There have been several researches on agent-mediated electronic commerce. In particular, we focus on volume discount mechanism based on agent-mediated electronic com-merce. In this paper, we propose a new <b>group</b> <b>buy</b> sche-me for agent-mediated electronic markets. In this scheme, we introduce the concept of sequential decision-making for seller agents and buyer agents. Further, we propose a cooperation mechanism among seller agents based on exchange items in stock. We implemented an agent-mediated electronic markets based on the <b>group</b> <b>buy</b> scheme.

5000|$|Recently, <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> {{has been}} taken online in {{numerous}} forms, although group buys prior to 2009 usually referred to the grouping of industrial products for the wholesale market (especially in China). Modern day online group buys are {{a variation of the}} tuángòu buying that occurs in China. Under tuángòu, an item must be bought in a minimum quantity or dollar amount, otherwise the seller will not allow the purchase. Since individuals typically do not need multiples of one item or do not have the resources to buy in bulk, group buys allow people to invite others to purchase in bulk jointly. These group buys, often result in better prices for individual buyers or ensure that a scarce or obscure item is available for sale. Group buys were, in the past, often organized by like-minded online shoppers through Internet forums. Now these shoppers have also started to leverage the <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> model for purposes of buying other consumer durables. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> sites are back in demand as small businesses look for ways to promote their products to budget-conscious consumers in a weak global economy. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> is also used for purchasing real estate properties.

50|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> {{have led to}} a wide increase of appearances of similar phenomena in Europe and North America. While the original strategy for <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> in China was self-organized and executed, most of the <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> in Europe and North America is done only through online intermediaries. Interested buyers are, most often, asked for credit card details, which will be charged only when a required number of buyers register. Almost without an exception, intermediaries charge vendors a percentage fee in the range of up to 50% of the total value of the whole deal. Due to this business model, <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> remains limited to the physical services sector and is not seeing growth as with the original strategy in the People's Republic of China.Nevertheless, intermediaries with fairly identical business models are appearing daily, especially across the United Kingdom and Germany. The most notable characteristic of all those intermediaries is the selected deals orientation towards local markets, bound to cities and towns. Leaders include Groupon (and their United Kingdom's spinoff, MyCityDeal), LivingSocial, Plum district, BuyWithMe (Bought by GILT in winter 2011), and TeamBuy (Canada), with hundreds of copycats in different languages. The Groupon and other <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> sites’ business model is working with local retail stores and restaurants with location-targeted coupons but national chains are also participating. Gap participated in a Groupon promotion during summer of 2010 that generated over $10 million in sales in one day. Nordstrom has also joined Groupon as a vendor.|$|E
