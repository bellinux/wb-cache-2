5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> retain their best players as {{salaries}} escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary {{has always been}} one of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return.|$|E
5|$|Goeslaw {{is married}} to guitarist Anto Hoed. Together they have two children, Anakku Lelaki Hoed and Lelaki Bernama Hoed (literally My Son Hoed and Boy Named Hoed). In her spare time she enjoys shopping, playing with her children, and {{browsing}} the internet; she has stated that she finds it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> enjoy shopping due to being constantly recognised. She has stated that she prefers being backstage over giving concerts, as {{she does not have}} to wear make-up or rehearse.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999 the RAAF has put its Hornets {{through a}} series of {{upgrades}} to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> operate and are at risk of being outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E
50|$|Access to safe {{abortions in}} Ohio is {{becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> Ohio abortion {{laws and the}} attempts to close many of Ohio's abortion clinics.|$|R
50|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} the levels get <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> play as new {{elements such as}} spikes and bouncy walls are introduced.|$|R

5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax {{is almost}} {{revealed}} at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean {{to avoid the}} humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
50|$|While {{the center}} of mass becomes lower, the base of support is reduced and it becomes <b>increasingly</b> more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} balance and the correct posture.|$|R
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the original 1922 locomotives is <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult,</b> due <b>to</b> the lack of parts and expertise, and the remoteness of his base in El Mait√©n. This can cause frequent delays or service shut-downs.|$|R
50|$|Susannah Roe died in 1887. James Roe {{found it}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> {{thereafter}} <b>to</b> {{live on the}} money he made from the Herald, so from 1890 he also worked in his daughter's market garden. He died in May 1897.|$|R
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

50|$|To conclude, {{the seventh}} episode {{examines}} {{the state of}} the planet {{from the perspective of the}} top predators and their ever <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> struggle <b>to</b> survive - and also considers the scientists and conservationists who are determined in their collective fight to protect them.|$|R
50|$|After Warner {{was forced}} into {{bankruptcy}} in 1893, Swift moved the telescope to California where his new patron, Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, was building an observatory on Echo Mountain. By that time observations in New York were becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> the developing city around it.|$|R
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of}} the north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|Supporting the Australian {{units in}} Korea placed heavy {{demands on the}} RAAF's {{transport}} force, which {{was too small to}} fully meet its domestic and international responsibilities, and it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> sustain the four Dakotas in Malaya during 1952. As a result, the Australian Government decided in September that year to return the squadron to Australia. No. 38 Squadron left Changi for Richmond on 8 December. The squadron's only fatality during the deployment was an airman who was killed when the No. 110 Squadron RAF Dakota he was co-piloting crashed during a flight between Changi and Saigon on 31 August 1950.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} have a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, but it has a cooperative multiplayer mode that pits four players together to complete a nine-mission campaign based on the campaign of the original Syndicate games. Players face enemies that become <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> deal with as the game progresses. They can choose from four character classes: Medic, Spec Ops, Assault and Generic, each with different abilities. The breaching mechanic is also present in the mode for defensive and offensive purposes. For instance, they can hack into a turret to disable its armor or heal team-mates using this mechanic. Players receive points as they progress through the game's levels; these points can be used to research new weapons.|$|E
50|$|It {{is set to}} be {{a rising}} trend in the UK, where getting your child into a good local school is {{becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> underfunding and overcrowding. The UK Conservative party alluded {{to the concept of}} Micro-Schooling in 2007 with their concept of Pioneer schools.|$|R
25|$|The {{increasing}} push of settlement, increased police efficiency, {{improvements in}} rail {{transport and communications}} technology, such as telegraphy, made it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for bushrangers <b>to</b> evade capture.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} after the {{changing}} of the political system this tendency slowed down, since it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> for people <b>to</b> find jobs in the industrial plants nearby.|$|R
5|$|The rebel bands {{had worked}} {{independently}} {{of each other}} until July, when al-Hajj Muhammad, Arif Abd al-Raziq and Fakhri Abd al-Hadi decided to coordinate the actions of their respective militias. Abd al-Raziq was based in the Bani Sa'b area around Tayibe, while Abd al-Hadi operated in Sha'ruwiya, around Arraba. All of their areas of operation were concentrated in the north-central highlands. Another meeting between the leaders was held in August to designate official areas of operation and specific targets to attack. The Jerusalem-area militia of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was absent from both of these meetings, making it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> form a solid military command among rebels across the country.|$|E
5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the Japanese were finding it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{resupply}} their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, {{refusing to let}} Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the Japanese were forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
50|$|CodinGame is a {{technology}} company editing an online platform for developers, {{allowing them to}} play with programming with <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> puzzles, <b>to</b> learn to code better with an online programming application supporting twenty-five programming languages, and to compete in multiplayer programming contests involving timed artificial intelligence, or code golf challenges.|$|R
50|$|Baldric ran {{twice as}} a four-year-old, {{but failed to}} recover his best form, as he became <b>increasingly</b> temperamental and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> train.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, market {{trading was}} {{becoming}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> the increase in wheeled traffic. Old Market became an important tram terminus, serving areas to the east, north-west and south of the city. By now it was also a well-established shopping street, connecting seamlessly with Castle Street.|$|R
5|$|During 1941, the Middle East Commandos and Layforce were tasked {{to carry}} out a {{campaign}} of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British had the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve. As the strategic situation worsened, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> employ them in the manner intended, as they were called upon as reinforcements {{to the rest of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{stage of the}} voyage to Antarctica from Buenos Aires, he was kept busy {{with a number of}} routine tasks. He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found it <b>increasingly</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift {{of power in the}} capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
