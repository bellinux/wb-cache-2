High quality imaging requires good characteristics of resolution, low side lobes and large depth of focus.

Using William Crawford's concept of photographic 'syntax', the use of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is explored as an example of how technology shapes style. 	A detailed study of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> from the earliest forms to the present is presented, enumerating the core properties of pinhole, early experimental and commercial soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses.</b> This was researched via published texts in period journals, advertising, private correspondence, interviews, and the lenses themselves. The author conducted a wide range of in-studio experiments with both period and contemporary soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> to evaluate their character and distinct features, as well as to validate source material. 	Nodal points of this history and development are explored in the critical debate between the diffuse and sharp photographic image, beginning with the competition between the calotype and daguerreotype. The role of George Davison's The Old Farmstead is presented as well as the invention of the first modern soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> the Dallmeyer-Bergheim, and its function in the development of the popular Pictorialist lens, the Pinkham & Smith Semi-Achromatic. The trajectory of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is plotted against the Pictorialist movement, noting the correlation betwixt them, and the modern renaissance of soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> and the diffuse aesthetic.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{automate}} the double-image distance measurement by photographing the rod image, the errors of telescope and prism must be either eliminated or corrected. In theory, corrections can be made, but in practice they {{do not appear to}} be feasible. A description is given of systems which are free of these errors, In these systems the deviations are caused by reflections. Especially in photography they show such disadvantages, that they are of no use in practice. A reasonable solution is obtained by the use of a rod which is marked from the centre into both directions. The results, obtained with this rod are satisfactory. When measuring distances by the use of stadia hairs, focussing problems appear. These problems are discussed extensively. With the aid of a large series of observations, a formula has been found for the standard deviation in focussing. A description is given of the possibilities for eliminating the influence of the incorrect focussing. Placing a stop behind the eye piece appears to be the best solution. In the telescope with external focussing the stop should be placed in the rear focal plane of the eye lens. In the telescope with internal focussing the stop must be placed in the image of the plane, equally far in front of the <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> as the <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> lies in front of the crosshairs. The distance measurements by means of double image as well as by means of stadia hairs, using a telescope with external focussing, turn out to be affected by temperature fluctuations in the same manner. The telescope with internal focussing is more strongly affected by temperature changes. Measurements of distances by means of stadia hairs with elimination of the influence of incorrect focussing are given. After this elimination both methods of optical distance measurement turn out to be equally accurate...|$|E
40|$|Cavity-enhanced Laser-Induced Fluorescence With the {{incorporation}} of a new optic mount and <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> a cavity ring-down set-up was altered to collect fluorescence signal from molecules seeded in a molecular beam. Running both the CRDS and fluorescence measurements simultaneously produced a technique with significantly enhanced sensitivity compared to {{either of the two}} individual methods. Preliminary analysis with SO 2 and a selection of polyaromatic molecules point to the method been best suited for measuring the fluorescence spectra of fast fluorescence lifetime (< 1 ns) molecules and in confined environments i. e. molecular beams. This has been characterised using a known sample and also compared to the CRDS and fluorescence measurements ran as individual techniques. The method was found to increase the sensitivity of the current experimental set-up by two orders of magnitude. This was then applied in the analysis of two new molecular samples to obtain spectra for use in analysing the torsional motions within the molecule. Torsional Motion Analysis of 2, 5 -bis(phenylethynyl) thiophene Torsional motions in polyphenyls, potential molecular wires, are important in the charge carriage capability of the species. Using a combination of UV-cavity ring-down and fluorescence detection the absorption and photoexcitation spectra of 2, 5 -bis(phenylethynyl) thiophene were successfully measured. Using a simple cosine potential and simulation program the spectra were reproduced and were found to be close to the values determined in previous research on the two ring system tolane and 1, 4 -bis(phenylethynyl) benzene. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{experimentation}} and {{developments in the}} production of a novel laser machined prototype graphitic separations column utilizing an array of graphitic micro-pillars. The column was created with a 5 kHz Thales femtosecond laser, a highly focussed beam from a stationary multi-element <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> to machine the fluidic tracks and micro-pillared array directly into a graphitic block as a single structure. This novel HPLC column format could potentially create a much more robust separations column with respect to temperature and pressure and reduce the band broadening associated with conventional chromatographic columns because of the inhomogeneous bead packing and the influence of side walls. The computer-aided design (CAD) was developed in Alpha-Cam and converted into code for the motion control system in order to traverse the workpiece in X and Y with an Alpha-Cam post processor. An integrated on-chip sample injector and fluidic flow-distributor are incorporated onto the column to minimize band broadening and enable more equal fluid flow across it. Half pillars were machined into the edge of the array to minimize band broadening. The separation column was integrated directly with the ESI probe of a Thermo Fisher Surveyor mass spectrometer. The device was tested at HPLC pressures and successfully performed without leakage. It’s evaluation as a chromatographic separations column showed the repeated partial separation of two molecules. This represents the first demonstration of a micro-machined graphitic microfluidic device and it’s performance in separation science...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a close range Passive Millimetre Wave (PMMW) scanning thermal imager. Whilst close range PMMW imager has previously been applied to concealed weapon detection at ranges of a few metres, the imager described herein is designed to focus on targets at a range of a few tens of centimetres. In particular, the main design aim was to produce higher resolution thermal maps suitable for medical imaging applications. Imaging at MMW frequencies offers greater penetration depths in lossy dielectric media than conventional infrared imagers, although there is an obvious trade-off in spatial resolution. The instrument consists of a total power radiometer operating at a centre frequency of 94 GHz. The input to the radiometer is provided by a quasi-optical <b>focussing</b> <b>lens,</b> designed using Gaussian Bean Mode theory. The observed scene is scanned {{by means of a}} rotating mirror and a translation table. Image acquisition timescales were of the order of a few minutes. Thermal calibration of the radiometer output was performed by recording the image of adjacent hot and cold reference loads with each line scan. In addition, the thermal transition between the calibration loads was used to measure the beam profile of the input optics and the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the instrument. The imager has shown {{that it is possible to}} produce useful close range thermal images of the human body at MMW frequencies. The spatial resolution achieved was approximately 3 mm, with a thermal resolution of 0. 4 K...|$|E

Further information is available at: [URL] cladding with wire utilises a <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> to melt {{the surface of the}} substrate, into which the wire is fed to build up a clad track on the surface. Process reliablity issues in practice include; clad tracks with high levels of dilution, surface cracking and other defects. Key to this is wire reflectivity calculations. Here using Fresnel equations that relate angle of incidence to heat absorption, we are able to show a direct correlation between the applied heat profile of the laser beam and the absorption profile of the wire surface; this has been modelled using COMSOL multiphysics conduction simulations which showed that the heat profile of the applied laser beam has a direct effect on {{the size and shape of}} the resulting melt pool. Using computer generated Holographic Optical Elements (HOE), a novel form of optic that alters the heat profile of the laser beam to a user-specified 3 d profile, a conventional 1. 25 mm diameter Gaussian beam shape and a 1. 25 mm square uniform ‘pedestal’ HOE-derived beam shape were tested and compared, using a 1 mm diameter AISI 316 stainless steel wire on a 0. 8 mm mild steel substrate. These results were also compared to an enlarged 3. 5 mm diameter Gaussian beam, in order to evaluate different methods of altering the heat distribution applied to the wire. The HOE generated beam gave superior results, due to its shorter thermal cycle, which reduced the amount of heat going into the clad track and resulted in lower dilution...|$|E

40|$|The instabilities which {{occur in}} the {{interaction}} of CO 2 laser radiation with a dense plasma have been studied. A TEA CO 2 laser provided pulses of up to 30 joules of energy {{with a duration of}} 50 nanoseconds. By focussing the radiation on to a plane target a focal spot of about 180 micrometers diameter was formed with a irradiance of 10 to 10 W cm. The scattered radiation was collected by a laser <b>focussing</b> <b>lens</b> and analysed with a grating spectrometer. Linear relationships have been found between the incident irradiance and the back scattered energies. This is in contrast to the results of other workers who have found quadratic relations at high irradiance. The back scattered energies were of the order compared with the incident energy. The spectrum of shows a displacement to longer wavelength which is attributed to stimulated Brillouin scattering, there being an ion acoustic wave which is driven by the laser radiation. A similar displacement occurs in the 2 W spectrum and is attributed to the scattering of plasmons from the ion acoustic wave. The measured displacement is in agreement with a theory due to Silin. Fine structure also exists in the 2 W spectrum, a shoulder being found on the red side of the line and this may result from a non-Maxwellian electron temperature distribution. There is also a satellite which is displaced towards longer wavelengths by about 0. 1 micrometers from the precise value of 2 W Explanations of this feature are offered. The self-generated magnetic field has been measured and its effect on the interactions have been examined. The plasma temperature has been determined by X-ray measurements and compared with the values estimated from the scattered spectrum. <p...|$|E

50|$|An {{overhead}} projector {{works on the}} same principle as a 35mm slide projector, in which a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally {{the size of a}} printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and <b>focusing</b> <b>lens),</b> in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side opposite the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R
