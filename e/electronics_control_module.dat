An elevator {{is one of the}} important aspects in <b>electronics</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> in automotive application. Nowadays, Myanmar is a developing country and there is enormous increase in high-rise building in Myanmar. This paper mainly focuses on using {{programmable logic controller}} to control the circuit and building the elevator model. Hall Effect sensor is used for the elevator position. DC Motor is used to control the up and down movement of the elevator car. Push buttons are used to call the elevator car. The elevator position is described by using the display unit.

40|$|In {{this modern}} era, {{elevators}} {{have become an}} integral part of any commercial or public complex. It facilitates the faster movement of people and luggage between floors. The elevator control system is one of the most important aspects in <b>electronics</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> that are used in automotive application. Usually elevators are designed for a specific building taking into account the main factors such as the height of the building, the number of people traveling to each floor and the expected periods of high usage. The elevator system is designed with different control strategies. This implementation is based on FPGA, which can be used for a building with any number of floors, with the specified inputs and outputs. This controller can be implemented for an elevator with the required number of floors by simply changing a control variable in the HDL code. This approach is based on an algorithm which reduces the amount of computation required, by focusing only on the relevant rules that improves the performance of the group of elevator system. The elevator controller was developed using Verilog HDL and was successfully implemented on a Xilinx Artix...|$|E

40|$|The DUMAND-II {{detector}} will {{search for}} astronomical sources of high energy neutrinos. Successful {{deployment of the}} basic infrastructure, including the shore cable, the underwater junction box, and an environmental module was accomplished in December, 1993. One optical module string was also deployed and operated, logging data for about 10 hours. The underwater cable {{was connected to the}} shore station where we were able to successfully exercise system controls and log further environmental data. After this time, water leaking into the <b>electronics</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> for the deployed string disabled the string electrical system. The acquired data are consistent with the expected rate of downgoing muons, and our ability to reconstruct muons was demonstrated. The measured acoustical backgrounds are consistent with expectation, which should allow acoustical detection of nearby PeV particle cascades. The disabled string has been recovered and is undergoing repairs ashore. We have identified the source of the water leak and implemented additional testing and QC procedures to ensure no repetition in our next deployment. We will be ready to deploy three strings and begin continuous data taking in 1995.

40|$|The {{elevator}} control system {{is one of}} the important aspects in <b>electronics</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> in automotive application. Here {{elevator control}} system is designed with different levels. First the elevator control system is implemented for multi-storage building. This implementation is based on FPGA based Fuzzy logic controller for intelligent control of elevator group system. This proposed approach is based on algorithm which is developed {{to reduce the amount of}} computation required by focusing only on relevant rules and ignoring those which are irrelevant to the condition for better performance of the group of elevator system. Here only two inputs are considered i. e. elevator car distance and number of stops. Based on these data the fuzzy controller can calculate the Performance Index (PI) of each elevator car, the car which has maximum PI gives the answer to the hall calls. This would facilitate reducing the Average Waiting Time (AWT) of the passenger. In the second level, the dispatching algorithm is implemented for multi-storage building. Here six types of dispatching algorithms are considered. Based on the traffic situation and condition, one algorithm out of six is operated, that should reduce the Average Waiting Time of passenger and reduce the power consumption of elevator system. The hardware part of the work consists of a simple D. C. Motor, which can control the up and down movement of the elevator car. This D. C. Motor is controlled through the MC 9 S 12 DP 256 B microcontroller. Here four floor elevator systems have been considered and every floor has two switches, one switch is used for up movement and another switch is used for down movement. Based on the switch pressed, the elevator car can move either in upward or downward direction. Here two sensors are used in every floor. One sensor is used for detecting the elevator car when elevator car reached to its destination floor. This sensor detects the car and stops the D. C. Motor. At the same time, another sensor is used for opening and closing the door. Finally, a novel fuzzy based PID controller algorithm is implemented in the MC 9 S 12 dp 256 B microcontroller. This algorithm is mainly used for maintaining the constant speed of D. C. Motor with different load conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model of}} {{distributed}} power system with power electronic controlled loads. Distribution networks transport the electrical energy from the transmission substations to the various loads. There are so many power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads that are connected in the distribution power system. Due to intensive use of power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads in an industry and other consumers in general, the harmonics produces a distortion in distribution network. Therefore, to protect the power system from the power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads, {{it is very important}} to identify the types and number of all the working power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads. The result of this paper shows that the method of calculating the number and also the types of all working power <b>electronics</b> <b>controlled</b> loads in any distribution system.
