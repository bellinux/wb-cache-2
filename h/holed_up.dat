5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been <b>holed</b> <b>up</b> with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho.

Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest.

5|$|De Montfort {{was unable}} to {{consolidate}} his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country.
