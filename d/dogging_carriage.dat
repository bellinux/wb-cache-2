50|$|The Dalmatian is {{also known}} as a coach <b>dog</b> or <b>carriage</b> <b>dog,</b> because it was {{formerly}} used to run in attendance on a coach.|$|R
50|$|With {{the demise}} of horse-drawn transport, {{the need for the}} dogs declined, and they became largely {{ceremonial}} assets, but were often repurposed as static house- and barn- guard <b>dogs.</b> Today <b>carriage</b> <b>dogs</b> are valued as loyal pets and companions.|$|R
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> <b>dog</b> or coach dog is bred {{for running}} beside a carriage.|$|R
50|$|The Dalmatian is a {{breed of}} medium sized dog, {{noted for its}} unique black or liver spotted coat and mainly used as a <b>carriage</b> <b>dog</b> in its early days. Its roots trace back to Croatia and its {{historical}} region of Dalmatia. Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.|$|R
6000|$|... "How about {{poor little}} me?" [...] said the Angel modestly. [...] "I've {{got to run}} about behind the wheels of popularity, like a spotted <b>dog</b> behind a <b>carriage,</b> getting all the dust and trying {{to look as if}} I was an {{important}} part of the machine. I must seem a perfect fool to you onlookers sometimes." ...|$|R
50|$|The Dalmatian is also associated, {{particularly}} in the United States, with Budweiser beer and the Busch Gardens theme parks, since the Anheuser-Busch company's iconic beer wagon, drawn {{by a team of}} Clydesdale horses, is always accompanied by a Dalmatian <b>carriage</b> <b>dog.</b> The company maintains several teams at various locations, which tour extensively. Dalmatians were historically used by brewers to guard the wagon while the driver was making deliveries.|$|R
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> <b>dog</b> or coach dog {{refers to}} a type of dog rather than a {{specific}} breed. Dogs of this type were usually bred and trained to trot alongside carriages to protect the occupants from banditry or other interference. They were usually owned and used by the wealthy or traders and merchants. The dogs were trained to attack the horses used by highwaymen, giving the owners' human security time {{to respond to the}} actual robbers.|$|R
60|$|Corruption {{appears to}} be so general {{throughout}} the whole of Russia that all classes have come to accept {{it as part of}} the established order of things. A friend gave me a little dog to bring away with me. It was a valuable animal, and I wished to keep it with me. It is strictly forbidden to take <b>dogs</b> into railway <b>carriages.</b> The list of the pains and penalties for doing so frightened me considerably.|$|R
5000|$|Even in {{the early}} stages, some of these camps became quite elaborate. In 1883, {{one of the first}} families, the Stokes, would arrive in a [...] "special parlour horse car direct from 42nd street to Ausable for $100." [...] The party {{consisted}} of ten family members and an equal number of servants, [...] "three horses, two <b>dogs,</b> one <b>carriage,</b> five large boxes of tents, three cases of wine, two packages of stovepipe, two stoves, one bale of china, one iron pot, four washstands, one barrel of hardware, four bundles of poles, seventeen cots and seventeen mattresses, four canvas packages, one buckboard, ..., twenty-five trunks, thirteen small boxes, one boat, one hamper", all of which was then transferred to wagons for the 36 mi ride to Paul Smiths, and thence by boat to their island campsite.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibition}} {{concentrates on}} coaches and sleighs from the 18th to the 20th century {{that belonged to}} Basel family estate. It documents transport, mobility and is an attest to the excellent workmanship of Basel's coachbuilders during this period. Shown are further attractions such as hunting <b>carriages,</b> <b>dog</b> carts, phaetons, coupés and landaus, as well as mail coaches, commercial horse-drawn vehicles, children's coaches and sleighs. Further exhibits are, for example, accessories such as harnesses and coachmen's liveries.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Fourth Street in Santa Ana, {{showing a}} horse-drawn {{carriage}} and {{a man on a}} bicycle, ca. 1910. The carriage, next to which a dog walks, is pictured at {{the left side of the}} unpaved street that bisects the image. Apparently moving, the <b>dog</b> and <b>carriage</b> are blurred. Farther right, across a set of railcar tracks at the center of the street, a man on a bicycle can be seen riding away from the viewer. Two- to three-story commercial buildings line the streets on either side, just a few feet back beyond the sidwalks, along with what appears to be a church in the left distance. To the right, bicycles can be seen leaning against the curb, while pedestrians stand at the corner in the foreground, from which a utility pole can be seen to extend. A lantern hangs above the scene from a set of cables suspended by the pole.; Legible signs from left to right include: "Bristol & Rowley, Druggists", "Drug Store", and "[W]all Paper"...|$|R
5000|$|The {{greatest}} {{tourist attractions}} are {{the mountains and}} the numerous ski resorts. In the cold season, winter sports enthusiasts will find ideal conditions for their favourite sport: skiing, cross country skiing, freeriding, snowboarding, ice skating, sled <b>dog</b> rides, <b>carriage</b> rides, tobogganing, snow and fun parks. Due to its unique location in the mountains it is also possible to cross Vorarlberg on skis. [...] "Ski Ride Vorarlberg" [...] is a combination of skiing, touring and freeriding and takes tourists from the Kleinwalsertal in the north to the Montafon in the south. The tour takes place in a small group and is accompanied by a guide. The route takes them through open terrain and on-piste ski areas - whatever is available. In the summer all mountain sports are in the foreground: hiking, mountain biking, trail-running, but also resting and boating on Lake Constance. Above all, Vorarlberg stands for cultural offers of all kinds: the Bregenzer Seefestspiele with its own lake-stage are the best known and for many years a cultural highlight. In addition, there are many museums and attractions such as the Kunsthaus Bregenz, the Vorarlberg Museum and the Jewish Museum.|$|R
5000|$|The early Great Camps started life {{as simple}} tent camps, often on land {{initially}} leased from hotel owners, as hotel guests sought a more authentic wilderness experience. The tent camps evolved into tent platforms or lean-tos {{and then into}} compounds of rustic cabins. Even in the early stages, some of these camps became quite elaborate. In 1883 {{one of the first}} families on Upper St. Regis Lake, the Anson Phelps Stokes, would arrive in a [...] "special parlour horse car direct from 42nd street to Ausable for $100." [...] The party consisted of ten family members and an equal number of servants, [...] "three horses, two <b>dogs,</b> one <b>carriage,</b> five large boxes of tents, three cases of wine, two packages of stovepipe, two stoves, one bale of china, one iron pot, four washstands, one barrel of hardware, four bundles of poles, seventeen cots and seventeen mattresses, four canvas packages, one buckboard, ..., twenty-five trunks, thirteen small boxes, one boat, one hamper", all of which was then transferred to wagons for the 36 mile ride to Paul Smiths, and thence by boat to their island campsite.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Carlyle died on Saturday, April 21, {{under very}} {{peculiar}} circumstances. She {{was taking her}} usual drive in Hyde Park about four o'clock, when her little favourite dog--which was running {{by the side of}} the brougham--was run over by a carriage. She was greatly alarmed, though the dog was not seriously hurt. She lifted the <b>dog</b> into the <b>carriage,</b> and the man drove on. Not receiving any call or direction from his mistress, as was usual, he stopped the carriage and discovered her, as he thought, in a fit, or ill, and drove to St. George's Hospital, which was near at hand. When there it was discovered that she must have been dead some little time. Mrs. Carlyle's health had been for several months feeble, but not in a state to excite anxiety or alarm.|$|R
60|$|The {{revolving}} {{year now}} bringing the day round in its orderly sequence, Bella {{arrived in the}} Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration. It was the family custom when the day recurred, to sacrifice a pair of fowls {{on the altar of}} Hymen; and Bella had sent a note beforehand, to intimate that she would bring the votive offering with her. So, Bella and the fowls, by the united energies of two horses, two men, four wheels, and a plum-pudding <b>carriage</b> <b>dog</b> with as uncomfortable a collar on {{as if he had been}} George the Fourth, were deposited at the door of the parental dwelling. They were there received by Mrs Wilfer in person, whose dignity on this, as on most special occasions, was heightened by a mysterious toothache.|$|R
500|$|The 1912 prologue {{refers to}} {{events in the}} lives of Indiana's creators. When Indiana cracks the bullwhip to defend himself against a lion, he {{accident}}ally lashes and scars his chin. Ford gained this scar in a car accident as a young man. Indiana taking his nickname from his pet Alaskan Malamute is a reference to the character being named after Lucas's <b>dog.</b> The train <b>carriage</b> Indiana enters is named [...] "Doctor Fantasy's Magic Caboose", which was the name producer Frank Marshall used when performing magic tricks. Spielberg suggested the idea, Marshall came up with the false-bottomed box through which Indiana escapes, and production designer Elliott Scott suggested the trick be done in a single, uninterrupted shot. Spielberg intended the shot of Henry with his umbrella—after he causes the bird strike on the German plane—to evoke Ryan's Daughter.|$|R
5000|$|Particularly in the United States {{the use of}} Dalmatians as <b>carriage</b> <b>dogs</b> was {{transferred}} to horse-drawn fire engines. Today, the Dalmatian serves as a firehouse mascot and is sometimes used {{to educate the public}} in fire safety, but in the days of horse-drawn fire carts, they provided a valuable service, having a natural affinity to horses. They would run alongside the horses, or beneath the cart axles. [...] The horses have long since gone, but the Dalmatians, by tradition, have stayed. As a result, in the United States, Dalmatians are commonly known as firehouse dogs. Dalmatians are still chosen by many firefighters as pets, in honor of their past. The Dalmatian is also the mascot of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity. In the past, Pi Kappa Alpha has been known as the firefighters' fraternity, and this is why they both share the dalmatian as a mascot.|$|R
500|$|Singh {{authorised}} {{an auction}} of her belongings, with proceeds benefiting the Women's Tax Resistance League. She solicited subscriptions to the cause, and was photographed selling The Suffragette newspaper outside {{her home and}} from press carts. On 22May 1911 Singh was fined £3 by the Spelthorne Petty Sessions Court for illegally keeping a coach, a helper, and five dogs and for using a roll of arms. She protested that she {{should not have to}} pay the license fees without the right to vote. That July a bailiff went to Singh's house to collect an unpaid fine of 14shillings, which she refused to pay. Her diamond ring was then confiscated by the police and auctioned a few days later; a friend bought it and returned it to her. In December 1913, Singh was a fined £12.10s for refusing to pay license fees for two <b>dogs,</b> a <b>carriage</b> and a servant. On 13December 1913 she and other WTRL members appeared in court and Singh was again accused of keeping dogs without a license. Singh tried to fall in front of Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith's car while holding a poster reading, [...] "Give women the vote!" [...] She supported the manufacture of bombs, encouraging anarchy in Britain. Despite Singh's activism as a suffragette, she was never arrested; although her activities were watched by the administration, they may not have wanted to make a martyr of her.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to detect C. difficile A/B toxins and to isolate strains of C. perfringens and C. difficile from diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs in Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 57 dogs, 35 of which were apparently healthy, and 22 of which were diarrheic. C. difficile A/B toxins were detected by ELISA, and C. perfringens and C. difficile were identified by multiplex PCR. C. difficile A/B toxins were detected in 21 samples (36. 8 %). Of these, 16 (76. 2 %) were from diarrheic dogs, and five (23. 8 %) were from non-diarrheic dogs. Twelve C. difficile strains (21. 1 %) were iso-lated, of which ten were A+B+ and two were A-B-. All non-toxigenic strains were isolated from non-diarrheic animals. The binary toxin gene cdtB was found in one strain, which was A+B+ and was derived from a non-diarrheic dog. C. perfringens strains were isolated from 40 samples (70. 2 %). Of these, 18 (45 %) were from the diarrheic group, and 22 (55 %) belonged to the non-diarrheic group. All isolates were classified as C. perfringens type A and there was an association between the detec-tion of the cpe gene and the presence of diarrhea. Interestingly, ten strains (25 %) were positive for the presence of the cpb 2 gene. The high rate of detection of the A/B toxins in non-diarrheic dogs suggests the occurrence of subclinical disease in <b>dogs</b> or <b>carriage</b> of its toxins without disease. More studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology of C. difficile and C. perfringens in dogs and to better our understanding of C. difficile as a zoonotic agent. This is the first study to report the binary toxin gene in C. difficile strains isolated from dogs in Brazil...|$|R
60|$|As for ourselves, we have {{scarcely}} done so well, yet well; having {{enjoyed a}} great deal in spite of drawbacks. Murray, the traitor, sent us to Fano as a 'delightful summer residence for an English family,' and we found it uninhabitable from the heat, vegetation scorched with paleness, the very air swooning in the sun, and the gloomy looks of the inhabitants sufficiently corroborative of their words, that no drop of rain or dew ever falls there during the summer. A 'circulating library' 'which doesn't give out books,' and 'a refined and intellectual Italian society' (I quote Murray for that phrase) which 'never reads a book through' (I quote Mrs. Wiseman, Dr. Wiseman's mother, who has lived in Fano seven years), complete the advantages of the place, yet the churches are beautiful, and a divine picture of Guercino's is worth going all that way to see.[180] By a happy accident we fell in with Mrs. Wiseman, who, having married her daughter to Count Gabrielli with ancestral possessions in Fano, has lived on there from year to year, in a state of permanent moaning as far as I could apprehend. She is a very intelligent and vivacious person, and having been used to the best French society, bears but ill this exile from the common civilities of life. I wish Dr. Wiseman, of whose childhood and manhood she spoke with touching pride, would ask her to minister to the domestic rites of his bishop's palace in Westminster; there would be no hesitation, I fancy, in her acceptance of the invitation. Agreeable as she and her daughter were, however, we fled from Fano after three days, and, finding ourselves cheated out of our dream of summer coolness, resolved on substituting for it what the Italians call 'un bel giro.' So we went to Ancona, a striking sea city, holding up against the brown rocks and elbowing out the purple tides, beautiful to look upon. An exfoliation of the rock itself, you would call the houses that seem to grow there, so identical is the colour and character. I should like to visit Ancona again when there is a little air and shadow; we stayed a week as it was, living upon fish and cold water. Water, water, was the cry all day long, and really you should have seen me (or you should not have seen me) lying on the sofa, and demoralised out of all sense of female vanity, not to say decency, with dishevelled hair at full length, and 'sans gown, sans stays, sans shoes, sans everything,' except a petticoat and white dressing wrapper. I said something feebly once about the waiter; but I don't think I meant it for earnest, for when Robert said, 'Oh, don't mind, dear,' certainly I didn't mind in the least. People don't, I suppose, when they are in ovens, or in exhausted receivers. Never before did I guess what heat was--that's sure. We went to Loreto for a day, back through Ancona, Sinigaglia (oh, I forgot to tell you, there was no fair this year at Sinigaglia; Italy will be content, I suppose, with selling her honour), Fano, Pesaro, Rimini to Ravenna, back again over the Apennines from Forli. A 'bel giro,' wasn't it? Ravenna, where Robert positively wanted to go to live once, has itself put an end to those yearnings. The churches are wonderful: holding an atmosphere of purple glory, and if one could live just in them, or in Dante's tomb--well, otherwise keep me from Ravenna. The very antiquity of the houses is whitewashed, and the marshes on all sides send up stenches new and old, till the hot air is sick with them. To get to the pine forest, which is exquisite, you have to go a mile along the canal, the exhalations pursuing you step for step, and, what ruffled me more than all beside, we were not admitted into the house of Dante's tomb 'without an especial permission from the authorities.' Quite furious I was about this, and both of us too angry to think of applying: but we stood at the grated window and read the pathetic inscription as plainly as if we had touched the marble. We stood there between three and four in the morning, and then went straight on to Florence from that tomb of the exiled poet. Just what we should have done, had the circumstances been arranged in a dramatic intention. From Forli, the air grew pure and quick again; and the exquisite, almost visionary scenery of the Apennines, the wonderful variety of shape and colour, the sudden transitions and vital individuality of those mountains, the chestnut forests dropping by their own weight into the deep ravines, the rocks cloven and clawed by the living torrents, and the hills, hill above hill, piling up their grand existences as if they did it themselves, changing colour in the effort--of these things I cannot give you any idea, and if words could not, painting could not either. Indeed, the whole scenery of our journey, except when we approached the coast, was full of beauty. The first time we crossed the Apennine (near Borgo San Sepolcro) we did it by moonlight, and the flesh was weak, and one fell asleep, and saw things between sleep and wake, only the effects were grand and singular so, even though of course we lost much in the distinctness. Well, but you will understand from all this that we were delighted to get home--I was, I assure you. Florence seemed as cool as an oven after the fire; indeed, we called it quite cool, and I took possession of my own chair and put up my feet on the cushions and was charmed, both with having been so far and coming back so soon. Three weeks brought us home. Flush was a fellow traveller of course, and enjoyed it in the most obviously amusing manner. Never was there so good a <b>dog</b> in a <b>carriage</b> before his time! Think of Flush, too! He has a supreme contempt for trees and hills or anything of that kind, and, in the intervals of natural scenery, he drew in his head from the window and didn't consider it worth looking at; but when the population thickened, and when a village or a town was to be passed through, then his eyes were starting out of his head with eagerness; he looked east, he looked west, you would conclude that he was taking notes or preparing them. His eagerness to get into the carriage first used to amuse the Italians. Ah, poor Italy! I am as mortified as an Italian ought to be. They have only the rhetoric of patriots and soldiers, I fear! Tuscany is to be spared forsooth, if she lies still, and here she lies, eating ices and keeping the feast of the Madonna. Perdoni! but she has a review in the Cascine besides, and a gallant show of some 'ten thousand men' they are said to have made of it--only don't think that I and Robert went out to see that sight. We should have sickened at it too much. An amiable, refined people, too, these Tuscans are, conciliating and affectionate. When you look out into the streets on feast days, you would take it for one great 'rout,' everybody appears dressed for a drawing room, and you can scarcely discern the least difference between class and class, from the Grand Duchess to the Donna di facenda; also there is no belying of the costume in the manners, the most gracious and graceful courtesy and gentleness being apparent in the thickest crowds. This is all attractive and delightful; but the people wants stamina, wants conscience, wants self-reverence. Dante's soul has died out of the land. Enough of this. As for France, I have 'despaired of the republic' for very long, but the nation is a great nation, and will right itself under some flag, white or red. Don't you think so? Thank you for the news of our authors, it is as 'the sound of a trumpet afar off,' and I am like the war-horse. Neglectful that I am, I forgot to tell you before that you heard quite rightly about Mr. Thackeray's wife, who is ill so. Since your question, I had in gossip from England that the book 'Jane Eyre' was written by a governess in his house, and that the preface to the foreign edition refers to him in some marked way. We have not seen the book at all. But the first letter in which you mentioned your Oxford student caught us {{in the midst of his}} work upon art.[181] Very vivid, very graphic, full of sensibility, but inconsequent in some of the reasoning, it seemed to me, and rather flashy than full in the metaphysics. Robert, who knows a good deal about art, to which knowledge I of course have no pretence, could agree with him only by snatches, and we, both of us, standing before a very expressive picture of Domenichino's (the 'David'--at Fano) wondered how he could blaspheme so against a great artist. Still, he is no ordinary man, and for a critic to be so much a poet is a great thing. Also, we have by no means, I should imagine, seen the utmost of his stature. How kindly you speak to me of my dearest sisters. Yes, go to see them whenever you are in London, they are worthy of the gladness of receiving you. And will you write soon to me, and tell me everything of yourself, how you are, how home agrees with you, and the little details which are such gold dust to absent friends....|$|R
