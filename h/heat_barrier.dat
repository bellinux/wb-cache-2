50|$|Exhausts emit a {{large amount}} of heat into the engine bay, which can have a {{negative}} effect on engine performance by raising the underhood temperatures. As a result, high temperature insulation is used, more commonly known as <b>heat</b> <b>barriers,</b> for exhaust <b>heat</b> management. Thermal <b>barrier</b> ceramic-coatings are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, downpipes and tailpipes. When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore lessening the intake temperature. As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite due to frictional processes. This is possible because when applied, the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), therefore forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to El Nino, {{the warm}} pool stores heat and is {{confined}} to the far western Pacific. During the El Nino, the warm pool migrates eastward along with the concomitant precipitation and current anomalies. The fetch of the westerlies is increased during this time, reinforcing the event. Using data from the ship of opportunity and Tropical Atmosphere - Ocean (TAO) moorings in the western Pacific, {{the east and west}} migration of the warm pool was tracked over 1992-2000 using sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), currents, and subsurface data from Conductivity, temperature, depth taken on various research cruises. [...] This work showed that during westward flow, the BLT in the western Pacific along the equator (138oE-145oE, 2oN-2oS) was between 18 m - 35 m corresponding with warm SST and serving as an efficient storage mechanism for <b>heat.</b> <b>Barrier</b> layer formation is driven by westward (i.e. converging and subducting) currents along the equator near {{the eastern edge of the}} salinity front that defines the warm pool. These westward currents are driven by downwelling Rossby waves and represent either a westward advection of BLT or a preferential deepening of the deeper thermocline versus the shallower halocline due to Rossby wave dynamics (i.e. these waves favor vertical stretching of the upper water column). During El Nino, westerly winds drive the warm pool eastward allowing fresh water to ride on top of the local colder/saltier/denser water to the east. Using coupled, atmospheric/ocean models and tuning the mixing to eliminate BLT for one year prior to El Nino, it was shown that the heat buildup associated with barrier layer is a requirement for big El Nino. [...] It has been shown that there is a tight relationship between SSS and SST in the western Pacific and the barrier layer is instrumental in maintaining heat and momentum in the warm pool within the salinity stratified layer. Later work, including Argo drifters, confirm the relationship between eastward migration of the warm pool during El Nino and barrier layer heat storage in the western Pacific. [...] The main impact of barrier layer is to maintain a shallow mixed layer allowing an enhanced air-sea coupled response.

Surface mass density and temperature gradient irregularities favor the apparition of traps (planet accumulation region) and deserts (planet depletion zone). These features are found at the dust sublimation lines and <b>heat</b> transition <b>barriers.</b> Aims. We study how planets may remain trapped or escape these traps as they grow and as the disk evolves viscously with time. Methods. We numerically model the temporal viscous evolution of a protoplanetary disk by coupling its dynamics, thermodynamics, geometry, and composition. The resulting midplane density and temperature profiles allow the modeling of the interactions {{of this type of}} evolving disk with potential planets, even before the steady state is reached. Results. We follow the viscous evolution of a minimum mass solar nebula and compute the Lindblad and corotation torques that this type of disk would exert on potential planets of various masses that are located within the planetary formation region. We determine the position of planet traps and deserts in relationship with the sublimation lines, shadowed regions, and <b>heat</b> transition <b>barriers.</b> We notice that the planet mass affects the trapping potential of the mentioned structures through the saturation of the corotation torque. Planets that are a few tens of Earth masses can be trapped at the sublimation lines until they reach a certain mass while planets that are more massive than 100 M⊕ can only be trapped permanently at the <b>heat</b> transition <b>barriers.</b> They may also open gaps beyond 5 au and enter type II migration.

It offers, furthermore, explanations, solutions to problems, and ways of mathematical modelling. At the start. reaction and diffusion layers on iron and on molybdenum are considered. Because of overlapping metallurgical difficulties, the further studies are restricted to CVD overlay coatings. The "aluminizing " of the cooling channels in turbine blades made of Ni based superalloys by the subchloride process and MoSi 2 deposition on refractory alloys with diffusion barriers are described. Sic deposition with carbon excess on carbon substrates with lamella structure is explained by an oscillating chemical reaction. For the Sic deposition on the inner surface of porous substrates a mathematical model is offered. For CVD of layers on monofilaments in continuously moving carbon fibre bundles a successfully applied equipment is described as well as experimental results and a mathematical model for a quantitative consideration of the wmplex deposition process.

Together with the known Nb 4 AlC 3, the role of group III, IV elements in various properties of Nb(4) AC(3) (A = Al, Si, Ga, Ge) was systematically investigated, and particularly the bulk moduli, shear moduli, and Young's moduli helped us to approach the ductility. All the studied compounds {{were found to be}} mechanically stable, and they also exhibit the metallic nature that results from the Nb- 4 d states being dominant at the Fermi level. The typical 4 d- 2 p hybridization leads to strong Nb-C covalent bonding and a relatively weaker 4 d- 3 p (4 p) hybridization between Nb and A is identified. The latter does perturb the performance of materials. By varying A elements in Nb(4) AC(3), the position and the width of the p states as well as hybridizations are altered, which determine the covalency and the ionicity of the chemical bonds. A high density of states at the Fermi level and the nesting effects in the Fermi surface are identified in Nb 4 SiC 3 and linked to its unusual anisotropic behavior.
