5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or <b>double-stranded.</b> Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. <b>Double-stranded</b> genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially <b>double-stranded</b> and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Double-stranded</b> RNA (dsRNA) is RNA {{with two}} {{complementary}} strands, {{similar to the}} DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some viruses (<b>double-stranded</b> RNA viruses). <b>Double-stranded</b> RNA such as viral RNA or siRNA can trigger RNA interference in eukaryotes, as well as interferon response in vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The eleven dsRNA strands {{remain within}} the {{protection}} of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the <b>double-stranded</b> viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of <b>double-stranded</b> RNA.|$|E
40|$|The {{yields of}} unrepairable single-and <b>double-strand</b> {{breaks in the}} DNA of x-irradiated Chinese hamster cells were {{measured}} by low-speed neutral and alkaline sucrose density gradient sedimentation in order to investigate the relation between these lesions and reproductive death. After maximal single-strand remoining, at all doses, the number of residual single-strand breaks was {{twice the number of}} residual <b>double-strand</b> breaks. Both <b>double-strand</b> and unrepairable single-strand breaks were proportional to the square of absorbed dose, in the range 10 - 50 krad. No rejoining of <b>double-strand</b> breaks was observed. These observations suggest that, in mammalian cells, most <b>double-strand</b> breaks are not repairable, while all single-strand breaks are repaired except those that are sufficiently close on complementary strands to constitute <b>double-strand</b> breaks. Comparison with cell survival measurements at much lower doses suggests that loss of reproductive capacity corresponds to induction of approximately one <b>double-strand</b> break...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the presence of <b>double-strand</b> breaks or <b>double-strand</b> gaps increases the frequency of homologous recombination between two cotransferred DNAs when they are introduced into cultured mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the repair of these <b>double-strand</b> gaps is a major mechanism for homologous recombination between exogenous DNAs. In particular, when a plasmid DNA containing a 104 -base-pair (bp) gap in its tk gene (herpes simplex virus gene for thymidine kinase) undergoes recombination in mouse L cells to generate an intact gene, the majority of events result from direct repair of the <b>double-strand</b> gap using a cotransferred DNA as the template. We analyzed the recombination events by comparing the frequency of tk+ colonies, Southern blotting of cloned tk+ cell lines, and cloning recombined functional tk genes by plasmid rescue. In addition, by creating <b>double-strand</b> breaks within or adjacent to heterologous insertions in a mutant tk gene, we estimate that the L cell can generate a <b>double-strand</b> gap of between 152 and 248 bp and then can repair the gap to create a functional tk gene. We conclude that <b>double-strand</b> breaks and <b>double-strand</b> gaps are recombinogenic in transferred plasmid DNAs because they serve as intermediates in homologous recombination by <b>double-strand</b> gap repair, a nonreciprocal exchange of DNA or gene conversion event...|$|R

5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have <b>double-stranded</b> DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long <b>double-stranded</b> RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short <b>double-stranded</b> fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>double-stranded</b> DNA, RNA is a {{single-stranded}} molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.|$|E
40|$|DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks are {{particularly}} deleterious lesions {{that can lead}} to genomic instability and cell death. We investigated the SOS response to <b>double-strand</b> breaks in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In E. coli, <b>double-strand</b> breaks induced by ionizing radiation resulted in SOS induction in virtually every cell. E. coli strains incapable of SOS induction were sensitive to ionizing radiation. In striking contrast, we found that in B. subtilis both ionizing radiation and a site-specific <b>double-strand</b> break causes induction of prophage PBSX and SOS gene expression in only a small subpopulation of cells. These results show that <b>double-strand</b> breaks provoke global SOS induction in E. coli but not in B. subtilis. Remarkably, RecA-GFP focus formation was nearly identical following ionizing radiation challenge in both E. coli and B. subtilis, demonstrating that formation of RecA-GFP foci occurs in response to <b>double-strand</b> breaks but does not require or result in SOS induction in B. subtilis. Furthermore, we found that B. subtilis cells incapable of inducing SOS had near wild-type levels of survival in response to ionizing radiation. Moreover, B. subtilis RecN contributes to maintaining low levels of SOS induction during <b>double-strand</b> break repair. Thus, we found that the contribution of SOS induction to <b>double-strand</b> break repair differs substantially between E. coli and B. subtilis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Double-strand</b> breaks {{represent}} an extremely cytolethal form of DNA damage and thus pose {{a serious threat}} to the preservation of genetic and epigenetic information. Though it is well-known that <b>double-strand</b> breaks such as those generated by ionising radiation are among the principal causative factors behind mutations, chromosomal aberrations, genetic instability and carcino-genesis, significantly less is known about the epigenetic consequences of <b>double-strand</b> break formation and repair for carcinogenesis. <b>Double-strand</b> break repair is a highly coordinated process that requires the unravelling of the compacted chromatin structure to facilitate repair machinery access and then restoration of the original undamaged chromatin state. Recent experimental findings have pointed to a potential mechanism for <b>double-strand</b> break-induced epigenetic silencing. This review will discuss some of the key epigenetic regulatory processes involved in <b>double-strand</b> break (DSB) repair and how incomplete or incorrect restoration of chromatin structure can leave a DSB-induced epigenetic memory of damage with potentially pathological repercussion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks {{resulting}} from normal cellular processes including replication and exogenous {{sources such as}} ionizing radiation pose a serious risk to genome stability, and cells have evolved different mechanisms for their efficient repair. The two major pathways involved in the repair of <b>double-strand</b> breaks in eukaryotic cells are non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. Numerous factors affect the decision to repair a <b>double-strand</b> break via these pathways, and accumulating evidence suggests these major repair pathways both cooperate and {{compete with each other}} at <b>double-strand</b> break sites to facilitate efficient repair and promote genomic integrity...|$|R
5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four <b>double-stranded</b> arms joined together. These arms may adopt {{one of several}} conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after the molecular biologist Robin Holliday, who proposed its existence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|DNA stores {{biological}} information. The DNA backbone is {{resistant to}} cleavage, and both strands of the <b>double-stranded</b> structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as {{and when the}} two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming <b>double-stranded</b> RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the gene-targeting frequencies and recombination products {{generated by a}} series of vectors which target the hprt locus in embryonic stem cells and found the existence of alternative pathways that depend on the location of the <b>double-strand</b> break within the vector. A <b>double-strand</b> break in the targeting homology was found to increase the targeting frequency compared with a <b>double-strand</b> break at the edge of or outside the target homology; this finding agrees with the <b>double-strand</b> break repair model proposed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although a <b>double-strand</b> break in the homology is important for efficient targeting, observations reported here suggest that the terminal ends are not always directly involved in the initial recombination event. Short terminal heterologous sequences which block the homologous ends of the vector may be incorporated into the target locus. A modification of the <b>double-strand</b> break repair model is described to account for this observation.

40|$|In {{previous}} experiments, we {{have used}} yeast transformation to study the recombinogenic repair of <b>double-strand</b> breaks and gaps. A plasmid containing a <b>double-strand</b> gap within sequences homologous to the yeast genome integrates efficiently by crossing-over. During the process of integration, the <b>double-strand</b> gap is repaired, using chromosomal information as a template. This repair reaction results in the transfer of genetic information from one DNA duplex to another and is therefore a pathway for gene conversion. Because meiotic gene conversion {{is associated with a}} high frequency (up to 50 %) of crossing-over, we wished to determine the degree of association of <b>double-strand</b> gap repair with crossing-over. Only the class of repair events resulting in crossovers (plasmid integration) were detected in our earlier experiments with nonreplicating plasmids. In this paper, we describe the outcome of <b>double-strand</b> gap repair in plasmids that are capable of autonomous replication and therefore allow recovery of both crossover and noncrossover products. After the correct repair of a <b>double-strand</b> gap, we recover approximately equal numbers of integrated and nonintegrated plasmids. Thus, gene conversion by <b>double-strand</b> gap repair can occur either with or without crossing-over, and it is similar in this respect to meiotic gene conversion. Circularization of linear plasmid DNA by ligation is also observed, suggesting that yeast has an additional repair pathway for <b>double-strand</b> breaks that is independent of recombination. Gap repair on replicating plasmids permits rapid cloning of chromosomal alleles...|$|R
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully <b>double-stranded.</b> One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially <b>double-stranded</b> DNA is rendered fully <b>double-stranded</b> by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D.

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but <b>double-stranded</b> RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
40|$|The polA 1 {{mutation}} {{increases the}} sensitivity of E. coli K- 12 by killing by gamma-irradiation in air {{by a factor of}} 2. 9 and increases the yield of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks by a factor of 2. 5. These additional DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks appear to be due to the action of nucleases in the polA 1 strain rather than to the rejoining of radiation-induced <b>double-strand</b> breaks in the pol+ strain. This conclusion is based upon the observation that gamma-irradiation at 3 degrees did not affect the yield of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks in the pol+ strain, but decreased the yield in the polA 1 strain by a factor of 2. 2. Irradiation of the polA 1 strain at 3 degrees followed by incubation at 3 degrees for 20 min before plating resulted in approximately a 1. 5 -fold increase in the D 0. The yield of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks was reduced by a factor of 1. 5. The pol+ strain, however, did not show the protective effect of the low temperature incubation upon either survival or DNA <b>double-strand</b> breakage. We suggest that the increased yield of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks in the polA 1 strain {{may be the result of}} the unsuccessful exision repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA base damage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Double-strand</b> break repair {{models of}} genetic {{recombination}} propose that a <b>double-strand</b> break is introduced into an otherwise intact DNA {{and that the}} break is then repaired by copying a homologous DNA segment. Evidence for these models has been found among lambdoid phages and during yeast meiosis. In an earlier report, we demonstrated such repair of a preformed <b>double-strand</b> break by the Escherichia coli RecE pathway. Here, our experiments with plasmids demonstrate that such reciprocal or conservative recombination (two parental DNAs resulting in two progeny DNAs) is frequent at a <b>double-strand</b> break even when there exists the alternative route of nonreciprocal or nonconservative recombination (two parental DNAs resulting in only one progeny DNA). The presence of a long heterologous DNA at the <b>double-strand</b> break, however, resulted in a shift from the conservative (two-progeny) mode to the nonconservative (one-progeny) mode. The product is a DNA free from the heterologous insert containing recombinant flanking sequences.

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this <b>double-stranded</b> (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of <b>double-stranded</b> DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves <b>double-stranded</b> RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
40|$|The {{repair of}} DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks in Escherichia coli cells {{irradiated}} with gamma rays occurs only after new proteins are synthesized {{in response to}} damage introduced in the genome DNA. One protein whose synthesis is thus induced is the recA protein, and previous work has shown that recA- cells do not repair <b>double-strand</b> breaks. However, inducing recA protein by treating cells with nalidixic acid does not induce repair of <b>double-strand</b> breaks, so this repair requires more than {{the presence of the}} recA protein. When repair of <b>double-strand</b> breaks is blocked, the genome DNA is degraded by an endonuclease-like action. Evidence is presented to show that the inducible inhibition of DNA degradation after x-irradiation [Pollard, E. C. & Randall, E. P. (1973) Radiat. Res. 55, 265] is probably caused by the inducible repair of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} system based upon {{extracts}} of Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T 7 {{was used to}} study the mechanism of <b>double-strand</b> break repair. <b>Double-strand</b> breaks were placed in T 7 genomes by cutting with a restriction endonuclease which recognizes a unique site in the T 7 genome. These molecules were allowed to repair under conditions where the <b>double-strand</b> break could be healed by (i) direct joining of the two partial genomes resulting from the break, (ii) annealing of complementary versions of 17 -bp sequences repeated {{on either side of}} the break, or (iii) recombination with intact T 7 DNA molecules. The data show that while direct joining and single-strand annealing contributed to repair of <b>double-strand</b> breaks, these mechanisms made only minor contributions. The efficiency of repair was greatly enhanced when DNA molecules that bridge the region of the <b>double-strand</b> break (referred to as donor DNA) were provided in the reaction mixtures. Moreover, in the presence of the donor DNA most of the repaired molecules acquired genetic markers from the donor DNA, implying that recombination between the DNA molecules was instrumental in repairing the break. <b>Double-strand</b> break repair in this system is highly efficient, with more than 50 % of the broken molecules being repaired within 30 min under some experimental conditions. Gaps of 1, 600 nucleotides were repaired nearly as well as simple <b>double-strand</b> breaks. Perfect homology between the DNA sequence near the break site and the donor DNA resulted in minor (twofold) improvement in the efficiency of repair. However, <b>double-strand</b> break repair was still highly efficient when there were inhomogeneities between the ends created by the <b>double-strand</b> break and the T 7 genome or between the ends of the donor DNA molecules and the genome. The distance between the <b>double-strand</b> break and the ends of the donor DNA molecule was critical to the repair efficiency. The data argue that ends of DNA molecules formed by <b>double-strand</b> breaks are typically digested by between 150 and 500 nucleotides to form a gap that is subsequently repaired by recombination with other DNA molecules present in the same reaction mixture or infected cell...|$|R

5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or <b>double-stranded.</b> All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the nucleus}} {{is the site}} of transcription, it also {{contains}} a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the <b>double-stranded</b> DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Double-strand</b> breaks {{are widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be the}} most toxic form of DNA damage. Molecules that produce <b>double-strand</b> breaks via a single chemical event are typically very cytotoxic and far less common than those that form single-strand breaks. It was recently reported that a commonly formed C 4 ′-radical produces <b>double-strand</b> breaks under aerobic conditions. Experiments described herein indicate that a peroxyl radical initiates strand damage on the complementary strand via C 4 ′-hydrogen atom abstraction. Inferential evidence suggests that a C 3 ′-peroxyl radical induces complementary strand damage more efficiently than does a C 4 ′-peroxyl radical. Complementary strand hydrogen atom abstraction by the peroxyl radical is efficiently quenched by thiols. This mechanism could contribute to the higher than expected yield of <b>double-strand</b> breaks produced by ionizing radiation. <b>Double-strand</b> breaks (dsb) are considered {{to be one of the}} most toxic forms of DNA damage that threaten the integrity of the genome and cell death. 1, 2 Failure to repair even a single ds...|$|R
5000|$|As noted above, the BRCA1 protein plays a {{key role}} in {{homologous}} recombinational repair. This is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks. DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles. [...] Primordial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate (prophase I) stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed, and it is likely an adaptation for removing DNA damages, especially <b>double-strand</b> breaks, from germ line DNA. (Also see article Meiosis). Homologous recombinational repair employing BRCA1 is especially promoted during meiosis. It was found that expression of 4 key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA <b>double-strand</b> breaks (BRCA1, MRE11, RAD51 and ATM) decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice, leading to the hypothesis that DNA <b>double-strand</b> break repair is necessary for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a role in ovarian aging.|$|R
