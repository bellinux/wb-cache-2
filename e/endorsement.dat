40|$|Purpose and Approach This Chapter {{has three}} central goals: First, {{it aims to}} {{introduce}} the concept of consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements,</b> which we define as consumers’ intentional, public, and positive online affiliations with brands (e. g., liking a brand page on Facebook). Second, it {{provides an overview of}} the drivers and consequences of this phenomenon. Third, it answers the question whether and when the broadly adopted marketing strategy of consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements</b> is feasible. To accomplish these goals, we conducted a general review of the literature. Findings We identified three different drivers of consumers’ online brand endorsements: Identity-related drivers, brand-related drivers, and community-related drivers. Based on the literature we suggest that {{from the perspective of the}} endorsing consumer, online brand <b>endorsements</b> have the potential to be a two-sided sword. The greater potential of this marketing technique appears to rely on the fact that consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements</b> are broadcasted to a gigantic network of other consumers and their potential to be contagious. Value Consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements</b> are a new phenomenon and therefore quite understudied. Still, many brands have social media marketing strategies that aim to acquire huge amounts of <b>endorsements</b> by their consumers. The present chapter contributes to our knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements.</b> Moreover, it shows how and when consumers’ online brand <b>endorsements</b> can be a feasible marketing strategy...|$|R
