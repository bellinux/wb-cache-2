This algorithm guides the Mars entry vehicle along an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> trajectory designed to satisfy a set of equality and inequality constraints at chute deploy. An <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> assumption permits analytic prediction of terminal state conditions and {{eliminates the need for}} determining numeric state sensitivities. Trajectory deviations due to dispersions or uncertainties in Martian atmosphere, vehicle aerodynamics, or entry interface conditions are accommodated simply by predicting the compensating <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> profile and achieving this profile with the available lift control.

The use of the modified Chapman's variables and a normalized lift coefficient allows a general discussion of the optimum control of an arbitrary vehicle reentering any planetary atmosphere. Several planar problems are solved. Using the condition of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide,</b> the maximum cross range and the footprint of a reentry vehicle from circular speed are computed {{in terms of the}} maximum lift-to-drag ratio...|$|E
50|$|With D. mindanensis being {{a larger}} glider {{compared}} to its family members, it descends greater distances and will attain higher air velocities to reach equilibrium gliding. Findings suggest that takeoff heights greater than six meters or horizontal transit distances greater than nine meters {{are required to}} achieve <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glides.</b> Furthermore, {{in order to support}} its mass, glides occur at a higher velocity than smaller Draco lizards.|$|R
40|$|The pair {{of motion}} {{equations}} {{for entry into}} a planetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary, nonlinear differential equation of second order by disregarding two relatively small terms and by introducing a certain mathematical transformation. The reduced equation includes various terms, certain of which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal acceleration, and the lift force. If these particular terms are disregarded, the differential equation is linear and yields precisely the solution of Allen and Eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep angles of descent. If all the other terms in the basic equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component of drag force), the resulting truncated differential equation yields the solution of Sänger for <b>equilibrium</b> flight of <b>glide</b> vehicles with relatively large lift-drag ratios.

40|$|The {{availability}} of the Space Transportation System has provided a unique opportunity for deployment of atmospheric entry experiments. These experiments require a trajectory design that provides a well-defined and controlled flight environment. Items addressed in this paper include control of thermal and aerodynamic loading consistent with the test objectives, maintenance of acceptable velocity-altitude conditions, and accommodation of tracking and recovery requirements. Various strategies, including constant-drag flight, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide,</b> and controlled linear velocity-altitude flight segments are employed to effect desired trajectory conditions. Algorithms to match thermal constraints to entry conditions and vehicle aerodynamic configuration are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} contingency abort guidance schemes {{recently developed}} for multiple Space Shuttle main engine failures {{during the first}} two minutes of flight (first stage). The ascent and entry guidance schemes greatly improve the possibility of the crew and/or the Orbiter surviving a first stage contingency abort. Both guidance schemes were required to meet certain structural and controllability constraints. In addition, the systems were designed with the flexibility to allow for seasonal variations in the atmosphere and wind. The ascent scheme guides the vehicle to a desirable, lofted state at solid rocket booster burnout while reducing the structural loads on the vehicle. After Orbiter separation from the solid rockets and the external tank, the entry scheme guides the Orbiter through one of two possible entries. If the proper altitude/range/velocity conditions have been met, a return-to-launch-site 'Split-S' maneuver may be attempted. Otherwise, a down-range abort to an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> and subsequent crew bailout is performed...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the patagial membranes of gliding vertebrates, the aerodynamic surfaces used by falling wingless ants to direct their aerial descent are unknown. We conducted ablation experiments to assess the relative contributions of the hindlegs, midlegs and gaster to gliding success in workers of the Neotropical arboreal ant Cephalotes atratus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Removal of hindlegs significantly reduced the success rate of directed aerial descent {{as well as the}} glide index for successful flights. Removal of the gaster alone did not significantly alter performance relative to controls. <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> angles during successful targeting to vertical columns were statistically equivalent between control ants and ants with either the gaster or the hindlegs removed. High-speed video recordings suggested possible use of bilaterally asymmetric motions of the hindlegs to effect body rotations about the vertical axis during targeting manoeuvre. Overall, the control of gliding flight was remarkably robust to dramatic anatomical perturbations, suggesting effective control mechanisms in the face of adverse initial conditions (e. g. falling upside down), variable targeting decisions and turbulent wind gusts during flight...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of angle-of-attack {{modulation}} with the aim of enhancing transient performance of entry guidance during bank reversals, while compensating adverse effects of fast time-varying transient disturbances. An extended single-input/single-output system is developed in the velocity domain by means of a dynamic extension technique, and explicitly captures the trajectory dynamics of angle-of-attack modulation. A normal form for this extended system is derived for the sake of employing a feedback linearization controller. Further, the control characteristics of angle-of-attack modulation is found to be a non-minimum phase behavior under two common conditions in a near- <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> flight. Therefore, the issue of angle-of-attack modulation is formulated as robust output stabilization of the non-minimum phase system. A disturbance observer-based feedback linearization technique is used to design a robustly dynamical output-feedback controller for angle-of-attack modulation, and an internal-state feedback controller for bank-angle modulation is used to stabilize the unstable internal dynamics. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method of angle-of-attack modulation is enhanced compared to the existing shuttle method.

40|$|Fossils of the {{remarkable}} dromaeosaurid Microraptor gui and relatives clearly show well-developed flight feathers on the hind limbs {{as well as the}} front limbs. No modern vertebrate has hind limbs functioning as independent, fully developed wings; so, lacking a living example, little agreement exists on the functional morphology or likely flight configuration of the hindwing. Using a detailed reconstruction based on the actual skeleton of one individual, cast in the round, we developed light-weight, three-dimensional physical models and performed glide tests with anatomically reasonable hindwing configurations. Models were tested with hindwings abducted and extended laterally, as well as with a previously described biplane configuration. Although the hip joint requires the hindwing to have at least 20 ° of negative dihedral (anhedral), all configurations were quite stable gliders. Glide angles ranged from 3 ° to 21 ° with a mean estimated equilibrium angle of 13. 7 °, giving a lift to drag ratio of 4. 1 : 1 and a lift coefficient of 0. 64. The abducted hindwing model’s <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> speed corresponds to a glide speed in the living animal of 10. 6 m·s− 1. Although the biplane model glided almost {{as well as the other}} models, it was structurally deficient and required an unlikely weight distribution (very heavy head) for stable gliding. Our model with laterally abducted hindwings represents a biologically and aerodynamically reasonable configuration for this four-winged gliding animal. M. gui’s feathered hindwings, although effective for gliding, would have seriously hampered terrestrial locomotion...|$|E
40|$|The gliding ant Cephalotes atratus was {{the first}} describedexample of an animal capable of {{sophisticated}} aerodynamic control in the absenceof obvious morphological adaptations for aerial behavior. In this thesis Ipresent {{a series of studies}} aimed at quantitatively describing the aerodynamicsof stability and control in C. atratus, using a combination offield studies and modeling experiments. In Chapter 1, I present a quantitative analysis of the 3 -D trajectories followedby gliding C. atratus ants, measured using multiple-cameraphotogrammetric techniques in a natural rainforest environment. Thesetrajectories represent the first attempt to measure gliding trajectories in anatural environment for any animal, and provide a data-driven view of variationin aerodynamic characteristics and trajectory shape across multiple C. atratus individuals. The 3 -D analysis conducted in Chapter 1 showsthat C. atratus reach <b>equilibrium</b> <b>glide</b> speed (μ= 4. 12,σ= 0. 59) within 1 s of dropping from the canopy. Lift-to-drag ratios duringequilibrium gliding were higher for ants dropped further from a target treetrunk, but for a given horizontal distance between drop point and target treetrunk, lift-to-drag ratios were not observed to vary significantly with size. In Chapter 2, I present a kinematic analysis of the use of posture by gliding C. atratus ants. By dropping C. atratus workers into a verticalwind tunnel and analysing their behaviors using multiple cameras and postureestimation techniques, I show that gliding C. atratus antsimmediately adopt a parachuting pose with the legs elevated above the body axiswhen dropped. Changes in gaster flexion angle as well as the fore-aft angles ofthe mid- and hind-legs were observed in all analysed bouts of gliding, butstatistical attempts to find correlations between static postures and bodykinematics were ultimately unsuccessful due to the rapidity with which ants inthe wind tunnel changed posture. In Chapter 3, I present a quantitative description of stability and control ingliding ants, using dynamically scaled physical models to show how the posturalchanges discovered in Chapter 2 result in changes in the aerodynamic forcesexperienced by the ant as well as its stable body orientation. I show that thestandard gliding posture adopted by a falling C. atratus ant isaerodynamically stable in both pitch and roll, and that subtle changes inposture and the location of the center of mass result in significant changes inthe magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic force experienced by the ant. The postures associated with pitching and turning maneuvers, moreover, are alsoaerodynamically stable, which means that gliding C. atratus ants do not jeopardize their stability while conducting aerial maneuvers. Finally, by testing the aerodynamic performance of a flat, splayed-out posturefor C. atratus, as well as a modified C. atratus withshortened legs, I show that the elevated-legs posture adopted by C. atratus is fundamental to its stability, and that leg length is a keypredictor of aerodynamic stability and control...|$|E
