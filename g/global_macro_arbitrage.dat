40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the eight style-categories of hedge funds (Event Driven, <b>Global</b> <b>Macro,</b> Relative Value <b>Arbitrage,</b> Equity Hedge, Absolute Return, Distressed Restructuring, Equity Market Neutral and Merger Arbitrage) from January 2005 to June 2012 {{in order to}} examine if the hedge fund returns and {{correlations}} are affected by the crisis. This paper improves the AG-DCC-GARCH model, developed by Cappiello et al. (2006), by taking into account structural breaks during turbulent periods. The adjustment of variable Dummy in correlation construction has been verified significant and adequate in our work. We find a sharp increase in the correlations of returns during several turbulent periods, while the eight style-categories of hedge funds are normally weakly correlated with the general evolution of financial markets and also weakly correlated between themselves. This is undoubtedly a significant and untapped financial contagion dimension...|$|R

25|$|Hedge funds using a <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> {{investing}} strategy take sizable {{positions in}} share, bond or currency markets {{in anticipation of}} global macroeconomic events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return. <b>Global</b> <b>macro</b> fund managers use macroeconomic ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> strategies have {{a large amount of}} flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns. <b>Global</b> <b>macro</b> is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.|$|R

Mike Novogratz, former president of Fortress Investment Group, runs a global investment management firm with total assets under management of approximately $41.6 billion and $4.3 billion in a global macrohedge fund in 2015 discussed <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> trading in his video interview.

He says that there is an inherent difference between <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> fund managers and traditional equity managers.

50|$|GTAA is {{believed}} to be derived from, and share some characteristics of, <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> hedge funds and tactical asset allocation (TAA). <b>Global</b> <b>macro</b> hedge funds, like GTAA, seek to profit from taking positions in major world equity, bond or currency markets. However, the two differ in the fact that <b>global</b> <b>macro</b> has been characterized by large, undiversified bets, while modern GTAA strategies are generally well-diversified and operate with risk controls. TAA decisions undertaken by managers of multi-asset funds, like GTAA decisions, are intended to enhance investment outcomes by overweighting and underweighting asset classes based on their expected performance over relatively short time periods (usually 3 to 6 months). While TAA, within multi-asset funds, is restricted to the asset classes contained in the fund's strategic asset allocation, GTAA strategies enjoys the privilege of accessing a broader opportunity set.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} managerial skills in different categories of hedge funds.

We find that the <b>Global</b> <b>Macro</b> and Market Neutral funds do not follow a pure random walk. In fact, for both these models the drift parameter is statistically significant. This result rejects our initial hypothesis that hedge funds (expected-excess) returns are on average zero. Indeed, the positive intercept can be interpreted as evidence of managerial skill. We conclude that investors seeking to invest in hedge funds should consider Market Neutral funds and <b>Global</b> <b>Macro</b> funds as possible investments.
