5|$|The Office of Public Engagement was {{established}} on October 19, 2012, and includes the Rural Secretariat, the Voluntary and Non-Profit Secretariat, the Youth Engagement office, the Strategic Partnership Initiative, and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Office. Innovation, Business and Rural Development Minister Keith Hutchings was appointed as the minister {{responsible for the}} office, while Steve Kent was appointed parliamentary secretary for the office. Several days after his appointment Hutchings announced {{that the government was}} looking at putting restaurant <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> online for the public viewing. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had spent $457 obtaining <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> earlier the year, which had been criticized by former Service NL Minister Paul Davis during the debate on Bill 29. On November 22, 2012, Hutchings and Service NL Minister Nick McGrath announced that the public could now go on the government's website and see recent health and sanitation <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> for restaurants. While both opposition parties agreed with the government's decision to make the reports available online, Liberal MHA Andrew Parsons said that “I have no doubt that this is a response to the Bill 29 criticism".|$|E
5|$|The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOE)) is the {{regulatory}} and inspecting body for {{offshore oil drilling}} and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an <b>inspection.</b> <b>Reports</b> {{of the last three}} inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was {{exacerbated}} by {{a shortage of}} coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine <b>inspection</b> <b>reports,</b> the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.|$|E

25|$|Although the ICRC {{inspected}} the camp {{on a few}} occasions, headed by Swiss Army Colonel Auguste Rilliet, the inspection team simply noted that sanitary conditions could be improved, and prisoners {{were not aware of}} the length of their sentences or why they were in the camp in the first place. Only just prior to the removal of the commandant in September 1945, Rilliet rated the camp conditions unsatisfactory, {{in spite of the fact}} that Wauwilermoos was the subject of official protests by the United States, Great Britain, Poland, Italy, and even prevented normalization of diplomatic relations with the USSR. This may have been due to a secret agreement between the ICRC and the Swiss Army, which gave the Swiss Army permission to review and censor <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> prior to their release to foreign powers. Numerous Swiss citizens reported that the conditions at Wauwilermoos were in violation of the 1929 Geneva Conventions, including as below-mentioned, a Swiss Army medical officer, an officer on the Swiss Army's General Staff, and also by the editors of two Swiss newspapers.|$|E

500|$|In 1907, Sifton was {{one member}} of a three-member {{commission}} assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. [...] His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. [...] Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine <b>inspection</b> <b>reports,</b> the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. [...] The mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. [...] The commission recommended that children under sixteen {{should not be allowed to}} work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier Alexander Rutherford's government legislated an eight-hour day anyway.|$|E

2500|$|Department for Education {{officials}} {{were said to}} be taking an urgent interest in child protection arrangements at the school. [...] <b>Inspection</b> <b>reports</b> refer specifically to seven monks who have worked at the school at different times and whose behaviour has been [...] "a cause for concern". [...] The Independent Schools Inspectorate had previously criticised a lack of urgency in making improvements to child protection. The Charity Commission also sent a compliance team to work with the school on this, which it treated as [...] "a high-risk case". The Abbot responded by apologising to parents and reported that 50 years of confidential school records indicated that four of the monks had faced police action, two had restrictions imposed on them, and one was cleared and returned to monastic life. A review of school governance was already taking place. The school now works closely with the Diocese of Clifton in matters pertaining to Safeguarding Children and the two most recent Independent School Inspectorate Reports (2012, 2015) have noted the School's full compliance with current regulations.|$|E
2500|$|In early November 2011, The Sacramento Bee {{newspaper}} reported and analyzed various reports (including [...] "whistle-blower" [...] statements) concerning {{the potential for}} falsified <b>inspection</b> <b>reports</b> associated with deep pile foundations, including some supporting the SAS main tower. That article, and a later Sacramento Bee article published on May 26, 2012, provided details about construction and testing concerns and quoted experts in relevant engineering fields who {{raised questions about the}} adequacy of Caltrans’ testing and oversight, and construction and testing practices of the bridge builder. On June 12, 2012, shortly after publicly supporting further study of the concerns raised in the May Bee article, Caltrans issued a press release with an attached letter to the Bee's Executive Editor from Caltrans Director Malcolm Dogherty. That letter included a request for a full retraction of the article, this after asserting a number of specific technical refutations and criticisms of the language and tone of the article. On June 24, 2012, Joyce Terhaar, the Executive Editor of the Bee, responded in defense of the article and the mission of the paper. Caltrans has also responded with a nearly one-hour video presentation.|$|E
