5|$|As {{holders of}} the competition, Arsenal was {{admitted}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup for the 1994–95 season. They moreover contested in the 1994 European Super Cup, losing to Milan 2–0 on aggregate. In February 1995, Graham was sacked by Arsenal after it emerged he accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge {{for two of}} his clients: Jensen and Pål Lydersen. He was replaced by caretaker manager Stewart Houston (Bruce Rioch in the close season), who managed to take Arsenal into the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final after beating Sampdoria on penalties in the semi-finals. They however, did not retain the trophy after Real Zaragoza midfielder Nayim scored an extra-time goal, lobbing Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman.|$|E
5|$|The club's first {{entry into}} European {{competition}} occurred in 1968, {{as a result}} of winning the 1967–68 Football League Championship. However, the participation was short-lived, as the club suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Fenerbahçe in the first round. Entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup the following season was more successful; Manchester City won the competition, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 at the Prater Stadium in Vienna. The club reached the semi-final of the same competition the following year, and continued to play European football regularly during the 1970s. The club then endured a period of decline, and did not play in Europe again until 2003, a gap of 24 years. Since then the club has qualified for European competition on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup.</b> The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Suppose that a cup is {{installed}} at every {{point of a}} planar set P, and that somebody pours water <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cups.</b> <b>The</b> total rate at which <b>the</b> water flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> is 1. A player moves in the plane with unit speed, emptying <b>the</b> <b>cups.</b> At any time, the player sees how much water there is in every <b>cup.</b> <b>The</b> player has no information on how the water will be poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> in <b>the</b> future; in particular, the pouring may depend on the player’s motion. The backlog of the player is {{the maximum amount of}} water in any cup at any time, and the player’s objective is to minimise the backlog. Let D be the diameter of P. If the water is poured at the rate of 1 / 2 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> at <b>the</b> ends of a diameter, the backlog is Ω(D). We show that there is a strategy for a player that guarantees the backlog of O(D), matching the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant. Note that our guarantee is independent of the number of <b>the</b> <b>cups.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|On June 30, 2009, D.C. United began {{official}} cup competition {{against the}} Ocean City Barons of the USL Premier Development League. The match, hosted by United at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, Maryland, ended with D.C. on top 2–0. As a fourth-tier club, the Barons lineup had featured amateur players while United's included only three regular starters. The match remained scoreless for 74minutes before D.C. {{took the lead}} on a penalty kick by late substitution Christian Gomez. One week later, on July 7, D.C. United hosted their quarterfinal match at the SoccerPlex again and defeated the Harrisburg City Islanders of the USL Second Division 2–1. On July 21, 2009, D.C. United hosted another lower tier team in their semifinal match at the SoccerPlex. This time they defeated the Rochester Rhinos of the USL First Division 2–1. The match was tied 1–1 until the 82nd minute when Boyzzz Khumalo's goal propelled D.C. <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> final.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to be taken out to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|The Irvine–Lochhead {{partnership}} {{continued into}} the 1965–66 campaign. Irvine scored a goal in a 2–1 win against Lausanne Sports on a pre-season tour of Switzerland, and his first competitive goal of the season came on 24 August 1965 in the 3–1 home victory against Blackpool. He scored two in the return match at Bloomfield Road the following week, and two matches later he netted a hat-trick in the 4–1 defeat of Northampton Town. Between the 1–1 draw away at Leeds United on 30 October 1965 and the 5–2 win against Fulham on 11 December 1965, Irvine scored in seven consecutive league matches. In the 3–1 win against West Ham United, Irvine and Lochhead both scored in the same match for the first time, despite having played together for almost three seasons. Irvine took his goalscoring form <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> competitions, netting five times in three FA Cup ties, and scoring the winning goals against Southampton and Stoke City as the team reached the fifth round of the Football League Cup before being knocked out by Peterborough United. During {{the second half of}} the season, he went through a somewhat barren spell, failing to score in the league between 8 January 1966 and 26 March 1966. He ended his poor run of form with a hat-trick in the 4–1 win over Nottingham Forest at Turf Moor. He subsequently got on the scoresheet in the next six league games, including two goals against Sheffield Wednesday which took him to 27 league goals, the joint-highest total since George Beel's 30 in the 1928–29 season. Irvine's 29th and final goal of the season came on 23 April 1966 in the 2–0 home victory against Liverpool. He was the highest scorer in the Football League First Division that season, the first, and to date only, time a Burnley player had achieved the feat.|$|E

25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups {{of water}} in order to wash off the balls. However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in the cups instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from. In doing so, it removes the possibility of getting sick or drinking any dirt that may transfer from the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup.</b>|$|E
25|$|If ice {{is added}} after pouring it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> {{this results in}} the {{formation}} of an aesthetically unpleasant layer {{on the surface of the}} drink, because the ice causes the oils to solidify. If water is added first, the ethanol causes the fat to emulsify, leading to the characteristic milky color. To avoid the precipitation of the anise (instead of emulsion), drinkers prefer not to reuse an arak-filled glass. In restaurants, when a bottle of arak is ordered, the waiter will usually bring a number of glasses along with it for this reason.|$|E
25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> (the scoop), and she then runs her index finger along the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E

25|$|A {{possibly}} more definite reference to Kannada {{is found in}} the 'Charition Mime' ascribed to the late 1st to early 2nd century CE. The farce, written by an unknown author, is concerned with a Greek lady named Charition who has been stranded on the coast of a country bordering the Indian Ocean. The king of this region, and his countrymen, sometimes use their own language, and the sentences they speak could be interpreted as Kannada, including Koncha madhu patrakke haki ("Having poured a little wine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> separately") and paanam beretti katti madhuvam ber ettuvenu ("Having taken up the cup separately and having covered it, I shall take wine separately."). The language employed in the papyrus indicates that the play is set in one of the numerous small ports on the western coast of India, between Karwar and Kanhangad.|$|E
25|$|The {{season is}} usually a few races shorter {{than that of the}} Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, and the prize money is {{significantly}} lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide events in the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did so out of necessity as Dale Earnhardt's death forced him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> series ahead of RCR's intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three separate cars for RCR and his own race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.|$|E
