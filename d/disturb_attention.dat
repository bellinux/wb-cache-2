Indeed, it is as true as it is remarkable that Tom was the first to observe the new development.

40|$|In rats, nonspecific {{mechanical}} or neurotoxic lesions of the septum impair {{spatial memory}} in, e. g., Morris water- and radial-maze tasks. Unfortunately, {{the lack of}} specificity of such lesions limits inferences {{about the role of}} the cholinergic hippocampal projections in spatial cognition. We therefore tested the effects of septal lesions produced by 192 IgG-saporin in rats, which is highly selective for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, on home cage activity, noncognitive tests (modified Irwin test, open field and forced swimming tests, and various sensorimotor tasks), and the cone-field spatial learning task. The immunotoxic lesion reduced acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the septum (- 61 %) and hippocampus (>- 75 %). Rats with lesions showed mild home-cage hyperactivity at 4 weeks postlesion, but no noncognitive deficits at 13 weeks postsurgery. In the cone-field task, rats with septal lesions made more working- and reference-memory errors than the controls, but acquisition curves were parallel in both groups. The speed of visiting cones was faster in the rats with lesions, indicative of <b>disturbed</b> <b>attention</b> or increased motivation. These data support the growing evidence that involvement of the septohippocampal cholinergic system in spatial learning and memory may have been overestimated in studies that used lesions with poor selectivity.

The widow herself was also reported to be endowed with relations of equally homicidal eccentricities. Her two brothers, Stephen and Hector Boompointer, had Western reputations that were quite as lurid and remote. Her own experiences of a frontier life had been rude and startling, and her scalp--a singularly beautiful one of blond hair--had been in peril from Indians on several occasions. A pair of scissors, with which she had once pinned the intruding hand of a marauder to her cabin doorpost, was {{to be seen in}} her sitting room at Laurel Spring. A fair-faced woman with eyes the color of pale sherry, a complexion sallowed by innutritious food, slight and tall figure, she gave little suggestion of this Amazonian feat. But that it exercised a wholesome restraint over the many who would like to have induced her to reenter the married state, there is little reason to doubt. Laurel Spring was a peaceful agricultural settlement. Few of its citizens dared to aspire to the dangerous eminence of succeeding the defunct MacGlowrie; few could hope that the sister of living Boompointers would accept an obvious mesalliance with them. However sincere their affection, life was still sweet to the rude inhabitants of Laurel Spring, and the preservation of the usual quantity of limbs necessary to them in their avocations. With their devotion thus chastened by caution, it would seem as if the charming mistress of Laurel Spring House was secure from <b>disturbing</b> <b>attentions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Context: Hypothalamic {{damage caused}} by craniopharyngioma (CP) is {{associated}} with poor functional outcome. Objective: To assess cognitive function {{and quality of life}} in childhood-onset CP on hormonal replacement, including GH treatment. Design: A cross-sectional study with a median follow-up time of 20 years (1 - 40). Setting: Patients were recruited from the South Medical Region of Sweden. Participants: The study included 42 patients (20 women) surgically treated for a childhood-onset CP between 1958 and 2000. Patients were aged >= 17 years. Equally many controls, matched for age, sex, residence, and smoking habits, were included. Tumor growth into the third ventricle was found in 25 patients. Main Outcome Measures: All subjects were examined with a battery of cognitive tests and the following questionnaires: Symptom Checklist- 90, the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction, and the Social Network concept. Results: The CP patients had lower cognitive performance, reaching statistical significance in 12 of 20 test variables, including executive function and memory. Comparison of patients with tumor growth into the third ventricle to controls revealed a significant lower mean total score (P =. 006). A significant negative correlation was recorded between mean z-score of cognitive performance and years since operation (r = - 0. 407; P =. 014). No statistically significant group differences were observed across any of the 9 Symptom Checklist- 90 subscales. Conclusions: Adults with childhood-onset CP, on hormone replacement, including GH treatment, have memory defects, <b>disturbed</b> <b>attention,</b> and impaired processing speed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Increasing {{knowledge}} of the anatomical structures and cellular processes underlying psychiatric disorders may help {{bridge the gap between}} clinical signs and basic physiological processes. Accordingly, considerable insight has been gained in recent years into a common psychiatric condition, i. e. chronic alcoholism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed various physiological parameters that are altered in chronic alcoholic patients compared to healthy individuals [...] continuous electroencephalogram, oculomotor measures, cognitive event-related potentials and event-related oscillations [...] to identify links between these physiological parameters, altered cognitive processes and specific clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Alcoholic patients display: (1) high beta and theta power in the resting electroencephalogram, suggesting hyperarousal of their central nervous system; (2) abnormalities in smooth pursuit eye movements, in saccadic inhibition during antisaccade tasks, and in prepulse inhibition, suggesting <b>disturbed</b> <b>attention</b> modulation and abnormal patterns of prefrontal activation that may stem from the same prefrontal "inhibitory" cortical dysfunction; (3) decreased amplitude for cognitive event-related potentials situated along the continuum of information-processing, suggesting that alcoholism is associated with neurophysiological deficits {{at the level of the}} sensory cortex and not only disturbances involving associative cortices and limbic structures; and (4) decreased theta, gamma and delta oscillations, suggesting cognitive disinhibition at a functional level. DISCUSSION: The heterogeneity of alcoholic disorders in terms of symptomatology, course and outcome is the result of various pathophysiological processes that physiological parameters may help to define. These alterations may be related to precise cognitive processes that could be easily monitored neurophysiologically in order to create more homogeneous subgroups of alcoholic individuals.

40|$|Abstract Background With the {{increase}} of pediatric cancer survival rates, late effects {{and quality of life}} (QoL) have received more <b>attention.</b> <b>Disturbed</b> sleep in pediatric cancer is a common clinical observation, but research on this subject is sparse. In general, sleep problems can lead to significant morbidity and are associated with impaired QoL. Information on sleep is essential to develop interventions to improve QoL. Methods Children (2 - 18 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were eligible for this multi-center study. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3. 0 â¢ Acute Cancer Version (PedsQL) were used to assess sleep and QoL halfway through maintenance therapy. Sleep and QoL were measured during and after dexamethasone treatment (on-dex and off-dex). Results Seventeen children participated (age 6. 7 Â± 3. 3 years, 44 % boys). Children with ALL had more sleep problems and a lower QoL compared to the norm. There were no differences on-dex and off-dex. Pain (r = - 0. 6; p = 0. 029) and worry (r = - 0. 5; p = 0. 034) showed a moderate negative association with sleep. Reduced overall QoL was moderately associated with impaired overall sleep (r = - 0. 6; p = 0. 014) and more problems with sleep anxiety (r = - 0. 8; p = 0. 003), sleep onset delay (r = - 0. 5; p = 0. 037), daytime sleepiness (r = - 0. 5; p = 0. 044) and night wakenings (r = - 0. 6; p = 0. 017). Conclusion QoL is impaired in children during cancer treatment. The {{results of this study suggest}} that impaired sleep may be a contributing determinant.

40|$|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} characterised by <b>disturbed</b> arousal, altered <b>attention,</b> and fear processing, {{and a reduction}} in the ability to perform cognitive tasks. Predominant neurophysiological models of PTSD have been focused on alterations in fear-related regulation, and few incorporate broader changes in generic executive control which may underlie many of the clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits in PTSD. This thesis aimed to investigate the neurophysiology of executive inhibitory control in PTSD using a Go/NoGo response inhibition task and converging functional imaging, structural imaging and electrophysiological measures. The first series of studies aimed to elucidate a normative neural network model of inhibitory control, and are consistent with normative control involving the activation of a mainly right-lateralised ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) network. Inhibitory control-related activation was found to be affected by levels of anxiety and changes in underlying neural structure; alterations in frontal cortical maturation and volume were related to additional activation of bilateral frontal cortical regions and the dorsal striatum, with anxiety increasing the demand on inhibitory control-related activation. In contrast to healthy participants, PTSD was associated with reduced inhibitory control as indexed by inhibitory behaviour, diminished activation of the right VLPFC, and slowed inhibition-related information processsing. PTSD participants relied on the greater activation of a left fronto-striatal inhibition network to support control, with the activation affected by levels of PTSD severity and comorbid anxiety. This left fronto-striatal activation in PTSD was related to underlying increases in fronto-striatal neural structure. Further, the ability to efficiently engage a left fronto-striatal network in PTSD during inhibitory control predicted better response to cognitive behavior for PTSD, consistent with the proposal that an improved ability to flexibly engage control systems may facilitate the resolution of PTSD symptoms. Taken together, this program of research extends current neurophysiological model of PTSD to show that PTSD involves a fundamental disturbance in the function and structure of key fronto-striatal response control networks associated with inhibitory control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{cerebellar}} cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) is a neurobehavioral syndrome {{that may}} develop after congenital and acquired cerebellar lesions. The syndrome consists of deficits in executive functioning, spatial cognition, visualspatial memory and language and also involves personality and behavioral changes. We describe a 58 -year-old right-handed man who {{in addition to}} affective disturbances presented with a unique combination of cognitive and linguistic deficits following an ischemic infarction in the vascular territory of the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Neurocognitive and neurolinguistic examinations were performed in the acute phase (10 days post-onset) and lesion phase (four weeks post-onset) of the stroke. A Tc- 99 m-ECD SPECT study was performed five weeks after the stroke. Acute phase data revealed a generalized cognitive decline and mild transcortical sensory aphasia. In the lesion phase, the neurobehavioral tableau was dominated by executive dysfunctions, disrupted divided <b>attention,</b> <b>disturbed</b> visualspatial organization and behavioral abnormalities. Neurolinguistic investigations disclosed visual dyslexia and surface dysgraphia. Reading of words and visual lexical decision tasks of words and nonwords were severely defective and predominantly characterized by visual errors. In addition, writing irregular and ambiguous words resulted in regularization errors (phonologically plausible errors based on phoneme-grapheme correspondence rules). In {{the absence of any}} structural damage in the supratentorial brain regions, a quantified SPECT study showed a relative hypoperfusion in the right cerebellar hemisphere and the left medial frontal lobe. CCAS is for the first time reported in association with visual dyslexia and surface dysgraphia. We hypothesize that the cognitive and linguistic deficits might result from functional disruption of the cerebellar-encephalic pathways, connecting the cerebellum to the frontal supratentorial areas which subserve attentional and planning processes. This phenomenon of crossed cerebellarcerebral diaschisis is supported by SPECT findings revealing a hypoperfusion in the anatomoclinically suspected brain regions. The constellation of cognitive, linguistic and behavioral symptoms adds new evidence to the multifaceted area of cerebellar neurocognition and demonstrates that the cerebellum might {{play a crucial role in}} cognitive, linguistic, and affective processing...|$|R

Reduced overall QoL was moderately associated with impaired overall sleep (r = - 0. 6; p = 0. 014) and more problems with sleep anxiety (r = - 0. 8; p = 0. 003), sleep onset delay (r = - 0. 5; p = 0. 037), daytime sleepiness (r = - 0. 5; p = 0. 044) and night wakenings (r = - 0. 6; p = 0. 017). CONCLUSION: QoL is impaired in children during cancer treatment. The {{results of this study suggest}} that impaired sleep may be a contributing determinant. Consequently, enhanced counseling and treatment of sleep problems might improve QoL. It is important to conduct more extensive studies to confirm these findings and provide more detailed information on the relationship between sleep and QoL, and on factors affecting sleep in pediatric ALL and in children with cancer in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellar}} cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) is a neurobehavioral syndrome {{that may}} develop after congenital and acquired cerebellar lesions. The syndrome consists of deficits in executive functioning, spatial cognition, visual-spatial memory and language and also involves personality and behavioral changes. We describe a 58 -year-old right-handed man who {{in addition to}} affective disturbances presented with a unique combination of cognitive and linguistic deficits following an ischemic infarction in the vascular territory of the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Neurocognitive and neurolinguistic examinations were performed in the acute phase (10 days post-onset) and lesion phase (four weeks post-onset) of the stroke. A Tc- 99 m-ECD SPECT study was performed five weeks after the stroke. Acute phase data revealed a generalized cognitive decline and mild transcortical sensory aphasia. In the lesion phase, the neurobehavioral tableau was dominated by executive dysfunctions, disrupted divided <b>attention,</b> <b>disturbed</b> visual-spatial organization and behavioral abnormalities. Neurolinguistic investigations disclosed visual dyslexia and surface dysgraphia. Reading of words and visual lexical decision tasks of words and nonwords were severely defective and predominantly characterized by visual errors. In addition, writing irregular and ambiguous words resulted in regularization errors (phonologically plausible errors based on phoneme-grapheme correspondence rules). In {{the absence of any}} structural damage in the supratentorial brain regions, a quantified SPECT study showed a relative hypoperfusion in the right cerebellar hemisphere and the left medial frontal lobe. CCAS is for the first time reported in association with visual dyslexia and surface dysgraphia. We hypothesize that the cognitive and linguistic deficits might result from functional disruption of the cerebellar-encephalic pathways, connecting the cerebellum to the frontal supratentorial areas which subserve attentional and planning processes. This phenomenon of crossed cerebellar-cerebral diaschisis is supported by SPECT findings revealing a hypoperfusion in the anatomoclinically suspected brain regions. The constellation of cognitive, linguistic and behavioral symptoms adds new evidence to the multifaceted area of cerebellar neurocognition and demonstrates that the cerebellum might {{play a crucial role in}} cognitive, linguistic, and affective processing.

40|$|Anxiety {{problems}} {{are associated with}} a <b>disturbed</b> pattern of <b>attention</b> in which threat stimuli attract immediate hypervigilance followed by strategic avoidance. The nature of the interplay between hypervigilance and avoidance, and how this interplay affects emotional reactivity, however remains unclear. Five studies addressed this issue by experimentally inducing and manipulating a hypervigilant-avoidant gaze style in response to aversely conditioned faces (CS+). Experiment 1 showed that anxious participants exposed to the conditioning procedure displayed differential trend of skin conductance reactivity (GSR) and temporal sequencing of hypervigilance and avoidance bias to the eyes of conditioned versus unconditioned faces, relative to nonanxious participants. Experiment 2 found that retraining anxious participants to process the eyes of CS+ using featural sampling of the critical stimuli had no effect on the interplay between hypervigilance and avoidance to threat, nor on GSR to CS+. Experiment 3 found that retraining anxious participants to reappraise the emotional significance of the previously avoided stimuli determined a reduction in hypervigilance to the eyes of CS+, and reductions in GSR. Experiment 4 revealed that reappraisal manipulations affected cyclical hypervigilance-avoidance to the eyes of CS+ and GSR, even though gaze deployment to the stimuli was disrupted immediately after initial saccades towards the stimuli were initiated. Experiment 5 revealed that anxious participants trained to reorient gaze during early saccadic movements but impeded to make use of any useful controlled coping strategy at later stages of attentional processing did not reverse the hypervigilant-avoidant pattern of attentional biases and the SCR in response to the CS+. Overall, the results suggest that cyclical hypervigilance-avoidance in anxiety may be due to a failure to effortfully appraise the emotionally significant aspects of the fear material. Attentional training that focuses on reappraisal of these aspects is influential in reversing the hypervigilant-avoidant pattern of attentional biases and the exaggerated emotional response to the threat. Additionally, the results suggest that attentional deployment is not the key factor by which attentional training affects fear processing and emotion vulnerability. Finally, the results show that maladaptive processing of fear stimuli, despite sometime considered automatic, needs to include some sort of evaluative processing in order to impact on patterns of attentional bias, presumably because biased attention is driven by an interpretative-evaluative component that acts in regard of one&# 146;s goals and motivational states...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{based on}} what the researcher sees about PR profession which is done in the field or in worker society inappropriately, as we know in academic world, PR profession is a profession that links between the company and the external or internal side, we usually call it stakeholders so that they become one united that trust at each other, support, even coordinate at each other. Before going to the trust level, a company with PR is together trying to introduce themselves so the communication process happens. In communication process, achieving those things are not easy, because a lot of noises appear and the messages expected sent to stakeholders will become cut even gone. This thing makes the simpatic feeling that expected appears from communications even believing level then support and coordinate achieving will not be exist. This could happen because the noises which are really <b>disturbing</b> the concentration, <b>attention,</b> even the consciousness of communicant. Noises here can be varieties, for examples in conducive environment, communicator performances, behavior and attitude of communicators that we usually call it as personality. The Personality is the most crucial thing in PR profession. The form of the image begins from the personality itself, however good the video documentation of company profile and the succeed of PR activities are, but if they are not supported by the good personality like the profession of PR then those things will be in vain. Because of that, it is really necessary how the doer implements the personality that is divided into 4 types of personality, sanguine, melancholies, phlegmatic, and choleric. Inherent to run the profession as a PR, researcher wants to research UMM and Unisma as private Islam colleges Malang Raya. The researcher is curious whether these colleges care of PR profession or it is just as displayed puppet. This research is descriptive qualitative where the data gained directly or indirectly trough voice recorders and video of PR activities from the people which certain before with purposive sampling technique. The collected data will be done by interview and documentation of PR activities video and also short observation. The researcher uses descriptive qualitative research because of the expectation to describe the real facts that happen in the field, so the gained data can be recorded and observed significantly in the way of managing those things. It can explain the phenomenon in the filed whether it is appropriate or not toward what should happen from the PR profession itself. This thing is to make the research become more accurate and relevant with the problem and vision of the research. The result states the implementation of personality both universities are different obviously. UMM implements the sanguine type, but Unisma shows strong phlegmatic types a lot. Both of the universities have different influences towards many kind of brand image company activities. PR of UMM handles all the PR activities directly, but PR activities of Unisma can be coordinated or taken away by the other unit. This difference is becaused the trust and the understanding or leader toward PR profession is not same. So this affects the process of implementation the personality of PR profession in different kind...|$|R
