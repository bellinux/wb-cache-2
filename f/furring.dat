The church modernized the building, adding the transepts {{on the outside and}} heating and electric lighting inside. In 1915 the Brotherhood held its last retreat there. At some point past 1919, the year a photograph of the church shows the original board-and-batten siding in place, the current shingled siding was added, most likely with the older siding as <b>furring.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the exterior, Frank Lloyd Wright traded the dual-pitched, cross-gable roof in the Stick {{style for}} a more {{distinctive}} dual-pitched hip roof with deep eaves and thick wood fascia boards. The form and style of the roof exemplified Wright's Japanese influence, and has been likened {{to the design of}} Asian pagodas. The unique design was furthered by a tierred surface of cedar shingles created by <b>furring</b> strips under every fifth row. Three dormers – one each on the east, south, and west façades – were likewise faced in shingles and were topped by the same flared, double-pitched roofs.|$|E

2500|$|Waste streams rich in {{hardness}} ions as from de-ionisation processes {{can readily}} lose the hardness ions in {{a buildup of}} precipitated calcium and magnesium salts. This precipitation process can cause severe <b>furring</b> of pipes and can, in extreme cases, cause the blockage of disposal pipes. [...] A 1-metre diameter industrial marine discharge pipe serving a major chemicals complex was blocked by such salts in the 1970s.

But it was no purely fanciful resemblance which now, for a moment, almost led Captain Delano to think that nothing less than a ship-load of monks was before him. Peering over the bulwarks were what really seemed, in the hazy distance, throngs of dark cowls; while, fitfully revealed through the open port-holes, other dark moving figures were dimly descried, as of Black Friars pacing the cloisters.|$|E

6000|$|I live in {{the angle}} of a leaden wall, into whose {{composition}} was poured a little alloy of bell-metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches my ears a confused tintinnabulum from without. It is the noise of my contemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they met at the dinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in {{the contents of the}} Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are about costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress it as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of England and the Indies, of the Hon. Mr.----of Georgia or of Massachusetts, all transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap from their court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my bearings--not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but to walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may--not to live in this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand or sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They are all on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody. God is only the president of the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully attracts me--not hang by the beam of the scale and try to weigh less--not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist me. It affords me no satisfaction to commerce to spring an arch before I have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There is a solid bottom everywhere. We read that the traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that it had. But presently the traveller's horse sank in up to the girths, and he observed to the boy, [...] "I thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom." [...] "So it has," [...] answered the latter, [...] "but you have not got half way to it yet." [...] So it is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said, or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the <b>furring.</b> Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work with satisfaction--a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Fur</b> {{is present}} in most mammals which are common {{characters}} in both movies and video-games, {{and it is important}} to model and render <b>fur</b> both realistically and quickly. When the objective is real-time performance, <b>fur</b> is usually represented by texture layers (or 3 D textures), which limits the dynamic characteristics of <b>fur</b> when compared with methods that use an explicit representation for each <b>fur</b> strand. This paper proposes a method for animating and shaping <b>fur</b> in real-time, adding curling and clumping effects to the existing real-time <b>fur</b> rendering methods on the GPU. Besides <b>fur</b> bending using a mass-spring strand model embedded in the <b>fur</b> texture, we add small scale displacements to layers to represent curls which are suitable for vertex shader implementation, and we also use a fragment shader to compute intra-layer offsets to create <b>fur</b> clumps. With our method, it becomes easy to dynamically add and remove <b>fur</b> curls and clumps, {{as can be seen in}} real <b>fur</b> as a result of <b>fur</b> getting wet and drying up. (a) (c...|$|R
