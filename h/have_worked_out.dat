Cristina claims that the two would never <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> because she wanted to emulate him, not be by his side. Preston then reveals his ulterior motive for bringing Cristina to Switzerland: to ask her to take over his hospital, which she accepts.

500|$|In {{the ninth}} series, Harry reinstates Lucas {{as chief of}} Section D; this makes Lucas {{responsible}} for the integration of two new team members into the section, Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown). Vaughn returns and hands Lucas a briefcase with possessions from his life before MI5, including photographs of him and Maya Lahan. When he visits her, however, she is so shocked at his reappearance and angry over his letting her believe him dead that at first she wants {{nothing to do with}} him. Later, Vaughn promises to leave Lucas alone in exchange for an MI5 file on [...] "Albany"; Lucas eventually hands him what he believes is the file. Believing he is free from Vaughn, Lucas persuades Maya to restart their relationship. However, it is revealed the file was not Albany, though it leads to the location of the actual file. Vaughn forces Lucas to find the file, which is in the possession of former Section D member Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon). After convincing Malcolm to give him the file, Lucas hands it over to Vaughn, but it is soon discovered that this file, too, is a fake, and Malcolm has abandoned the house where he and Lucas had met. To force Lucas to continue seeking the file hand Vaughn kidnaps Maya. By this time, Harry Pierce has discovered that Lucas is not who he claims to be. Arrested and questioned, Lucas admits his true identity and his past, but convinces Harry to save Maya. A mortally wounded Vaughn is able to [...] "wake up" [...] Lucas' true persona, who he was before MI5. Believing Harry may not honour the deal they <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out,</b> Lucas intends to leave the country after getting his hands on the Albany file. The file is revealed to contain directions for building a genetic weapon that Vaughn has agreed to sell to the Chinese. After Lucas acquires the real file from Harry in exchange for team member Ruth Evershed, whom he has kidnapped, Maya is killed while he is trying to escape with her. He delivers the file to the Chinese agents anyway and intends to kill Harry for revenge. During their roof-top confrontation, Lucas learns that Albany is an elaborate deception; the genetic weapon is unworkable. Lucas then forces Harry to turn around, as if he is about to execute him. Instead, Lucas throws himself from the roof, to his death.|$|E

IAI states that the missile will have a dual pulse motor, is vertically launched and is able to engage both aircraft and sea skimming missiles. It has a fully active seeker, and the Barak-8 Weapons system is capable of multiple simultaneous engagements. It will have a two way datalink for midcourse update, as well as be able to integrate into larger C3I networks. The primary fire control sensor for the naval Barak-8/LRSAM will be the ELTA MF-STAR Naval AESA radar which Israel claims to be superior to many existing systems worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, David Handelman from Rolling Stone said {{the songs are}} [...] "buoyed by the deft interplay of the three voices and a poetic tornado of imagery", featuring [...] "equally far-flung" [...] musical samples on an album that is [...] "littered with bullshit tough-guy bravado, but it's clever and hilarious bullshit". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the Dust Brothers' [...] "deft" [...] production and the Beastie Boys' rhymes, which he called [...] "hilarious, vicious, surreal, snotty." [...] Writing for Playboy, Robert Christgau said although it [...] "doesn't jump you the way great rap usually does," [...] "the Beasties and Tone-Loc's Dust Brothers <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> a sound that sneaks up on you with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way". He commended them for [...] "bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz" [...] and wrote, [...] "the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault, and other real vices fools might accuse them of." [...] In a retrospective review, he said the record's [...] "high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you", calling it [...] "an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [...] came from and where they went from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{strategic}} attempts {{to form an}} [...] "Asian NATO" [...] with India, Japan, the US and Australia. The bilateral agreements <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> {{for all but the}} Indo-Australian angle, though this has been hurt by India's refusal to sign the NPT and Australia's consequent refusal to provide India with uranium until the latter do so. However, Australia has now cleared uranium sales to India by Labour party decision in Australian parliament and by this development the relations between both the commonwealth nations are set to improve. The Australian and Indian militaries have already worked well together. Of late the {{relations between the two countries}} were jolted by sensationalised media reporting in Indian media about attacks on Indian Community students in Melbourne, Australia. Indian Government lodged strong protests with the Australian Government. Australian Prime Minister Mr. Kevin Rudd said that [...] "Australia valued its education system and International Students are valued more here in Australia." [...] Mr. Rudd though said that his Govt. has ordered a thorough probe into the attacks and also condemned it in strongest possible terms, and whilst no significant break-through was achieved immediately, during the last couple of years the attacks have been virtually eliminated by strong police enforcement and community involvement. Under the leadership of Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard the relations between both the nations have significantly improved on part due to her holistic approach in relations.|$|E

60|$|But a {{more serious}} error than all these pervades what we may call the drawing-room view of the evolutionist theory. So far as Society with a big initial is concerned, {{evolutionism}} first began to be talked about, and therefore known (for Society does not read; it listens, or rather it overhears and catches fragmentary echoes) when Darwin published his 'Origin of Species.' That great book consisted simply of a theory as to the causes {{which led to the}} distinctions of kind between plants and animals. With evolution at large it had nothing to do; it took for granted the origin of sun, moon, and stars, planets and comets, the earth and all that in it is, the sea and the dry land, the mountains and the valleys, nay even life itself in the crude form, everything in fact, save the one point of the various types and species of living beings.
