5000|$|Brenner then {{focused on}} {{establishing}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{as a model}} organism for the investigation of animal development including neural development. Brenner chose this 1-millimeter-long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple, is easy to grow in bulk populations, and {{turned out to be}} quite convenient for genetic analysis. One of the key methods for identifying important function genes was the screen for roundworms that had some <b>functional</b> <b>defect,</b> such as being uncoordinated, leading to the identification of new sets of proteins, such as the set of UNC proteins. For this work, he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston. The title of his Nobel lecture on December 2002, [...] "Nature's Gift to Science," [...] is a homage to this modest nematode; in it, he considered that having chosen the right organism turned out to be as important as having addressed the right problems to work on.|$|E
50|$|Disseminated BCG infections {{occur in}} infants with SCID or with other severe T cell defects. However, in {{approximately}} half of the cases no specific host defect has been found. One possible explanation for this predilection was found in a 2.5-month-old Tunisian female infant who had fatal idiopathic disseminated BCG infection. In four children from Malta who had disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection {{in the absence of a}} recognized immunodeficiency. In the case of all five children, there was consanguinity in their pedigrees. All affected were found to have a <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> in the upregulation of TNFα production by their blood macrophages in response to stimulation with IFNγ. Furthermore, all lacked expression of IFNγR's on their blood monocytes or lymphocytes, and each was found to have a mutation in the gene on chromosome 6q22-q23 that encodes IFNγR1. Of interest, these children did not appear to be susceptible to infection with agents other than mycobacteria. Th1 responses appeared to be normal in these patients. The susceptibility of these children to mycobacterial infections thus apparently results from an intrinsic impairment of the IFNγ pathway response to these particular intracellular pathogens, showing that IFNγ is obligatory for efficient macrophage antimycobacterial activity. Since the initial discoveries of IFNγR1-deficient humans, many more examples have been found, and IFNγR2-deficient individuals have been found as well.|$|E

30|$|Accordingly, PhC {{structures}} with <b>functional</b> <b>defects</b> such as photonic cavities and waveguides {{have attracted}} {{much interest in}} photonic device fabrication. In particular, researchers have utilized various technologies such as colloidal self-assembly [5], layer-by-layer assembly [6], glancing angle deposition [7] and multi-beam holographic lithography [8] for 3 -dimensional (3 D) photonic crystal structure fabrication. However, such methods are not intrinsically appropriate for the incorporation of <b>functional</b> <b>defects</b> into the 3 D structures. Employment of a sophisticatedly made poly(dimethylsiloxanes) (PDMS) stamp with feature sizes comparable to light wavelength as a diffraction optical element facilitates simultaneous point defect incorporation into the 3 D nanostructures [9]. Juntao Li et al. created simultaneous <b>functional</b> <b>defects</b> within the PhC via their multi-beam phases holographic lithography [10] but, the period less than 5 μm and the beam focusing area larger than 100 μm were not realized with this method.|$|R

Previously, DNT cell detection and a <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> of T cells in a FAS-induced apoptosis test in vitro had been used for ALPS diagnosis. However, a <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> can also be detected in mutation-positive relatives (MPRs) who remain free of any ALPS-related disease. In contrast, lymphocytes from patients carrying a somatic mutation of FAS exhibit normal sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis in vitro. We assessed the soluble FAS-L concentration in the plasma of ALPS patients carrying FAS mutations. Overall, we showed that determination of the FAS-L represents, together with the IL- 10 concentration and the DNT cell percentage, a reliable tool for the diagnosis of ALPS.

40|$|International audienceAuto-reactive {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes play a {{key role}} in the progressive loss or destruction of melanocytes in vitiligo but the mechanism underlying the loss of self-tolerance is unknown. A deregulation of regulatory T-cell biology has recently been suggested. The analysis of the suppressive effects of peripheral T regulatory cells in vitiligo patients revealed a <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> in seven of 15 cases. This defect was strongly correlated with disease activity. The evaluation of the percentage of peripheral regulatory T lymphocytes did not reveal any intrinsic quantitative defect. Yet, a decrease in the percentage of such cells was noted in patients with progressive forms, suggesting a recruitment of regulatory T cells from the peripheral blood to the site of injury. This was further corroborated by the significant increase of Forkhead box P 3 expression in the vitiliginous skin of patients. Our data support the involvement of a <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> of peripheral regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of vitiligo and open new possibilities to advance therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{holographic}} fabrication of designed defect lines in photonic crystal lattices through phase engineering using a {{spatial light modulator}} (SLM). The diffracted beams from the SLM not only carry the defect’s content but also the defect related phase-shifting information. The phase-shifting induced lattice shifting in photonic lattices around the defects in three-beam interference {{is less than the}} one produced by five-beam interference due to the alternating shifting in lattice in three beam interference. By designing the defect line at a 45 degree orientation and using three-beam interference, the defect orientation can be aligned with the background photonic lattice, and the shifting is only in one side of the defect line, in agreement with the theory. Finally, a new design for the integration of <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> lines in a background phase pattern reduces the relative phase shift of the defect and utilizes the different diffraction efficiency between the defect line and background phase pattern.

Here, we demonstrate that HIV- 1 –specific CD 8 � T cells proliferate rapidly upon encounter with cognate antigen in acute infection, but lose this capacity with ongoing viral replication. This <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> can be induced in vitro by depletion of CD 4 � T cells or addition of interleukin 2 –neutralizing antibodies, and can be corrected in chronic infection in vitro by addition of autologous CD 4 � T cells isolated during acute infection and in vivo by vaccine-mediated induction of HIV- 1 –specific CD 4 � T helper cell responses. These data demonstrate a loss of HIV- 1 –specific CD 8 � T cell function that not only correlates with progressive infection, but also can be restored in chronic infection by augmentation of HIV- 1 –specific T helper cell function.

40|$|A {{specific}} type of gene mutation affecting the LDL receptor {{has been found in}} many Finnish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The mutant allele is characterized by a 9. 5 -kb deletion extending from intron 15 to exon 18. Molecular cloning and sequencing of a cDNA segment corresponding to the deleted allele indicated that the mutant receptor differs radically from the normal one because of loss of the domains encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18. The carboxy-terminal portion of the normal receptor, comprising the amino acids 750 - 839, has been replaced by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids. The mutant allele was found to occur in 23 (50 %) of 46 unrelated FH patients with an established <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> in the LDL receptor. In cultured fibroblasts from the FH patients with the 9. 5 -kb deletion, both receptor-mediated binding and internalization of 125 I-LDL were lower than normal, the former, on average, by 25 %, and the latter, on average, by 50 %. This combined <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> probably results from both impaired attachment and impaired internalization of the mutated receptor.

These observations suggest that naïve T cells develop their longer lifespan during their sojourn in the periphery.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} {{defects in}} color vision {{in patients with}} choroideremia. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Thirty patients with choroideremia (41  eyes) and 10 age-matched male controls (19 eyes) with visual acuity of ≥ 6 / 36 attending outpatient clinics in Oxford Eye Hospital underwent color vision testing with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test, visual acuity testing, and autofluorescence imaging. To exclude changes caused by degeneration of the fovea, a subgroup of 14 patients with a visual acuity ≥ 6 / 6 was analyzed. Calculated color vision total error scores were compared between the groups and related {{to a range of}} factors using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Mean color vision total error scores were 120 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 92, 156) in the ≥ 6 / 6 choroideremia group, 206 (95 % CI 161, 266) in the < 6 / 6 visual acuity choroideremia group, and 47 (95 % CI 32, 69) in the control group.

The cause of this disease is unknown. Langerhans cells are bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), which can develop from CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells {{as well as from}} monocytes. PROCEDURE: To test whether LCH patients have a general <b>functional</b> <b>defect</b> present in cells of their DC lineage, we generated immature DCs by culturing monocytes from nine patients with single- or multisystem LCH with GM-CSF and IL- 4, and analyzed their phenotype and function before and after an in vitro maturation stimulus. Immature DCs were analyzed for their phenotype and cytokine production, DCs matured in response to TNF-alpha plus PGE(2) were analyzed for their phenotype, their stimulatory capacity in MLR, cell aggregation, and activation-induced apoptosis. RESULTS: In summary, no difference was found between both immature as well as mature DCs generated from patients and controls regarding the expression of CD 1 a, CD 80, CD 86, MHC class I, and MCH class II antigens. Similarly, no difference was found regarding IL- 10, - 12, and TNF-alpha production, as well as regarding cell aggregation and apoptosis in response to external stimuli.
