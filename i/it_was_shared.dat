25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shared</b> by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help us understand the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{first great}} {{expansion}} of the country came with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, but brought it into minor conflict with the colonies of Spain which eventually resulted in the acquisition of Spanish Florida. The Oregon Country gave the United States access to the Pacific Ocean, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>shared</b> for a time with the United Kingdom. The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican-American War, after which the victorious United States obtained Mexico's northwestern quarter, including what was quickly made the state of California. However, as {{the development of the}} country moved west, the question of slavery became too much to ignore, as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern abolitionist states equal to the number of southern slave states, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the United States Congress.|$|E

The stranger's familiar knowledge of the room, his mysterious allusions to the [...] "risks" [...] Tappington had taken, and his sudden silence on the discovery of Bly's ignorance of the whole affair all pointed to some secret that, innocent or not, was more or less perilous, not only to the son but to the mother and sister.
