40|$|Background: SYNTAX {{score is}} an {{established}} angiographic scoring system for risk stratification {{of a patient}} undergoing coronary revascularization. There was always a theory between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists that a good outcome after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) operation needs at least one out of two limbs, either good contractility or good targets. If both are jeopardized the outcome will be suboptimal with considerable risky operation. We performed that study to confirm if vessels with poor distal run-off and high complexity of lesions might affect the outcome in those critical cohorts of patients with poor left ventricular function. Methods: This was a prospective observational non-randomized study. The study included 100 patients with jeopardized left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 32). 30 days post-operative follow- up was done. The primary end point was the composite criteria of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Results: The mean SYNTAX score of the studied cases was 32. 03  ±  9. 62. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the three groups. The <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> group showed more increase in total cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time and cross-clamp time, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and postoperative blood transfusion than the other two groups. <b>High</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> showed high positive correlation with the number of grafts. No statistically significant difference was found for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) among the three groups (p-value 0. 12). Conclusions: The complexity of coronary lesions and presence of poor targets were not associated with increased adverse outcomes in patients with low EF undergoing CABG. CABG is still the preferred method of revascularization in patients with complex multi-vessel disease and low EF...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) for unprotected left main coronary artery disease (ULMCAD) remains to be investigated. We identified 1, 005 patients with ULMCAD of 15, 939 patients with first coronary revascularization enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort- 2. Cumulative 3 -year incidence of a composite of death/myocardial infarction (MI) /stroke was significantly higher in the PCI group than in the CABG group (22. 7 % vs 14. 8 %, p = 0. 0006, log-rank test). However, the adjusted outcome was not different between the PCI and CABG groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI 0. 79 to 2. 15, p = 0. 30). Stratified analysis using the SYNTAX score demonstrated that risk for a composite of death/MI/stroke was not different between the 2 treatment groups in patients with low (< 23) and intermediate (23 to 33) SYNTAX scores (adjusted HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 3. 76, p = 0. 19; adjusted HR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 1. 99, p = 0. 72, respectively), whereas in patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (≥ 33), it was significantly higher after PCI than after CABG (adjusted HR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 5. 16, p = 0. 006). In conclusion, risk of PCI for serious adverse events seemed to be comparable to that after CABG in patients with ULMCAD with a low or intermediate SYNTAX score, whereas PCI compared with CABG {{was associated with a}} higher risk for serious adverse events in patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score...</b>|$|E

Instead either of hypertension without diabetes or diabetes without hypertension were not associated with <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> These differences may be caused by: First, as mentioned above, different ethnic groups have different lifestyles, eating habits, geographical and cultural differences and other extrinsic factors. Secondly, CHD is multiple factor disease. In addition to the risk factors, the differences existed in gene in different ethnic. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed that the long-term event-free survival rates between the two groups had no significant difference, indicating that in addition to hypertension, blood glucose and blood lipid levels were also important factors of coronary events and prognosis and that the more-systematic medications of the post-PCI patients might play certain roles in improving the prognosis.|$|E

The SYNTAX score was calculated retrospectively by reviewing the original diagnostic angiograms. After excluding patients who had undergone CABG or PCI treatment within 6 months before surgery, we included 154 patients in the study. Patients were partitioned into tertiles according to the SYNTAX score (low, 18 - 26; high, > 26).

The CIRCULATING CELLS {{study was designed}} to study the role of several cellular mediators of atherosclerosis as biomarkers of coronary artery disease (CAD). An objective and reproducible method for the quantification of CAD extension is required to establish relationships with these potential biomarkers. We sought to analyse the correlation of the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> with known CAD risk factors to test it as a valid marker of CAD extension. Methods and results A subgroup of 279 patients (67. 4 % males) were included in our analysis. Main exclusion criteria were a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical revascularisation that prevent an accurate assessment of the SS.

40|$|Background: Fragmented QRS (f-QRS) {{complexes}} are novel electrocardiographic signals, which reflect myocardial conduction {{delays in}} patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The significance of f-QRS complexes in non-ST elevation ACS patients for detection {{of the severity of}} CAD (correlation with Syntax score) was evaluated in this prospective study. Methods: A total of 104 patients with non-ST-elevation ACS who underwent invasive coronary angiography for detection of coronary artery disease were recruited prospectively in this study, ECG was done to all patients, which showed f-QRS in 50 patients (f-QRS group) and inverted T wave or depressed ST in 54 patients (non f-QRS group). The significance of f-QRS complexes on 12 -lead ECG for detection of the severity of the CAD (correlated with Syntax score) was assessed in this cohort of patients. Results: Among the patients studied, elderly patients (age ⩾  65 years), males, diabetics, smokers and those with dyslipidemia had a significantly higher frequency of fQRS complexes (with P value =  0. 02, 0. 01, 0. 019, 0. 005, 0. 02 respectively).

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} reduced global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GLPSS) and the SYNTAX score (SS) in patients undergoing coronary angiography. We examined 71 patients undergoing both echocardiogram and coronary angiography within 15 days. All patients had normal global and/or regional wall motion on resting echocardiogram. We calculated GLPSS using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. SS was calculated for each group of patients based on the presence and/or the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) : no CAD on angiogram (n= 10, control group), low SS (n= 36, SS< 22) and high SS (n= 25, SS? 22). We hypothesised that GLPSS at rest is inversely correlated with the angiographically derived SS. Age, sex {{and most of the}} risk factors were equally distributed among the groups. There was a significant inverse correlation between GLPSS and SS values (r(2) = 0. 3869, P< 0. 001). This correlation was weaker in the low-SS group (r(2) = 0. 1332, P< 0. 05), whereas it was lost in the high-SS group (r(2) = 0. 0002, P=NS). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified that the optimal cut-off for the detection of high-SS patients was 13. 95 % (sensitivity= 71 %, specificity= 90 %, P< 0. 001).

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between HbA 1 c levels and the complexity of coronary artery lesions among the older patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA 1 c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012. The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the Syntax score, and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA 1 c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA 1 c levels and Syntax score. RESULTS: The mean age was 72. 3 ± 10. 6 years. The higher HbA 1 c levels were significantly associated with higher Syntax score (p< 0. 001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA 1 c levels and the Syntax score was 0. 371 (p< 0. 001). In addition, the higher HbA 1 c categories were able to independently predict patients with intermediate or <b>high</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> (Syntax score ≥ 23) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia and creatinine levels in the logistic regression analysis.

MethodsA total of 86 clinically stable patients with ULMCA stenosis who were unfit or unwilling for CABG underwent PCI with DES at two tertiary care centers in Kolkata. Patients were followed up prospectively for a median of 34. 6 months for major adverse cardiovascular events. Angiographic follow-up was done after 1 year of index procedure or earlier, if indicated. ResultsFifty-five patients (64 %) had distal left main stenosis. Two-stent technique was used in 19 patients (22 %) and single-stent technique in 36 patients (42 %) with distal left main lesion. Thirteen patients (15. 1 %) had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 45 %. There was no in-hospital death, MI, or stent thrombosis. During follow-up, major adverse cardiac event (MACE) occurred in 9 patients (10. 5 %). Our study revealed significantly greater MACE in patients with distal left main lesion with LVEF ≤ 45 % (50 % vs 6. 38 %, p= 0. 0002), <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (36. 36 % vs 6. 82 %, p= 0. 008), and diabetes (17. 95 % vs 0. 00 %, p= 0. 07).

40|$|Introduction: We {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{coronary}} lesion complexity assessed by SYNTAX (Sx) score on the clinical outcomes in patients who have received BMS versus undergone coronary bypass grafting. Patients and Methods: Our study population consisted of 459 consecutive patients received bare metal stents (n= 265) or coronary bypass grafting (n= 294). The complexity of coronary artery disease was assessed by Sx score. Sx score was classified as tertiles, as follows: low Sx score (≤ 22), intermediate Sx score (23 - 32) and high Sx score (≥ 33). Results: Throughout the study, the intermediate-term incidence of any revascularization was significantly higher in the percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with the coronary bypass grafting group for both overall group and Sx tertiles. The intermediate-term incidence of death from any cause was comparable between the treatment groups in patients with low and intermediate Sx tertiles. However, in patients with high Sx tertile, the intermediate-term incidence of death from any cause was significantly higher in percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with coronary bypass grafting group. In the overall population, adjusted [hazard ratio, 95 % CI: 0. 88 (0. 38 - 2. 05), p= 0. 780) risks for death from any cause were consistently comparable between percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary bypass grafting, whereas adjusted [hazard ratio, 95 % CI: 0. 12 (0. 05 - 0. 30), p< 0. 001] risks for any revascularization were consistently significantly higher in the percutaneous coronary intervention group compared with coronary bypass grafting group.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare midterm {{clinical}} outcomes of 1 -stop hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{for the treatment of}} multivessel coronary artery disease. BackgroundOne-stop HCR has emerged to be a feasible and attractive alternative to CABG and PCI in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. MethodsFrom June 2007 to December 2010, 141 consecutive patients underwent 1 -stop HCR at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 2 separate groups of 141 patients who underwent isolated CABG or PCI during the same period. All patients were stratified by the EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Score) and the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score. Cutoffs for EuroSCORE (low, ≤ 2; medium, > 2 and  24 and < 30; high, ≥ 30) were identified by tertiles. Three groups' cumulative major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rates in each risk tertile were compared. ResultsOne-stop HCR incurred MACCE rate lower than that with PCI (p < 0. 001), but similar to that with CABG (p = 0. 140). After stratification by EuroSCORE or SYNTAX score, the cumulative MACCE rates were similar among the 3 groups in low and medium tertiles. But in the high EuroSCORE tertile, patients who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a lower MACCE rate than did the groups that underwent CABG (p = 0. 030) and PCI (p = 0. 006). Meanwhile, patients with a <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a MACCE rate lower than did those who underwent PCI (p = 0. 002), but similar to that of those who underwent CABG (p = 0. 362).

40|$|Background: Myocardial {{perfusion}} grade (MPG) is {{an accepted}} method of evaluating myocardial perfusion. However, {{it does not}} take into the account, the extent of the perfusion. We hypothesized that myocardial blush area times MPG (total blush) would be more accurate than simple MPG, and yield better prognostic information. Methods: About 34 patients were recruited after they had consented to both coronary angiography (CAG) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and divided into two groups. A special dedicated computer was employed to calculate the total blush. The CAG was performed as a conventional way. Scintigraphic technetium 99 m methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile rest and stress images were evaluated quantitatively. The comparison was made between stenosis versus chronic total occlusion (CTO), MPG 1, 2 versus MPG 3, percutaneous intervention (PCI) successful versus failure. A correlation was made between ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial perfusion by MPG, total blush, SPECT, and <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> Results: The perfusion indices of total blush, summed difference <b>score</b> (SDS) and <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> were insignificant between the two groups (P > 0. 05). However, the left ventricular end diastolic volume was significantly larger in CTO (P < 0. 05). The patients with stenosis had better MPG than with CTO (P < 0. 05). The increased MPG was associated with increased total blush, <b>higher</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> and EF (P < 0. 05). Successful PCI resulted in better perfusion indicated by increased total blush, and MPG (P < 0. 05) but successful PCI did not change <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> EF and SDS significantly. Multivariate linear analysis with EF as the dependent factor and <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> SDS, total blush, blush area, and MPG as the independent factors showed a significantly higher degree of correlation (R = 0. 87, P < 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability to predict cardiac mortality of the Global Risk Classification (GRC) and the Clinical SYNTAX (Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score (CSS) in left main (LM) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). BackgroundThere is a renewed interest in combining clinical and angiographic information to define the risk of patients undergoing LM revascularization. MethodsThe GRC and CSS were assessed in patients undergoing LM PCI (n = 400) or CABG (n = 549). Stand-alone clinical (ACEF [age, creatinine, ejection fraction]), EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) and angiographic (<b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score)</b> risk scores were also investigated. ResultsThe GRC (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic 0. 357, p = 0. 550; area under the curve 0. 743) and the ACEF (Hosmer-Lemeshow 0. 426, p = 0. 514; area under the curve 0. 741) showed the most balanced predictive characteristics in the PCI and CABG cohorts, respectively. In PCI patients, the CSS used fewer data to achieve similar discrimination but poorer calibration than the GRC. Propensity-adjusted outcomes were comparable between PCI and CABG patients with low, intermediate, or high EuroSCORE, ACEF, GRC, and CSS and those with low or intermediate <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Conversely, in the group with the <b>highest</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> the risk of cardiac mortality was significantly higher in PCI patients (hazard ratio: 2. 323, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 091 to 4. 945, p = 0. 029).

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{long-term}} survival between patients with severe coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) achieving complete revascularization (CR) or incomplete revascularization. BACKGROUND The importance of CR in decision making regarding revascularization strategy in patients with severe coronary artery disease is unknown. METHODS Data were pooled from the SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery), PRECOMBAT (Premier of Randomized Comparison of Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease), and BEST (Randomized Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients With Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease) trials. The primary outcome was death from any cause and was compared in an as-treated analysis. RESULTS The rate of CR was 61. 7 % (57. 2 % with PCI and 66. 8 % with CABG). During a median 4. 9 -year follow-up period (interquartile range: 4. 5 to 5. 0 years), compared with patients undergoing CABG with CR, those undergoing PCI with incomplete revascularization had a higher risk for death from any cause (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1. 43; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 03 to 2. 00; p = 0. 036) and the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (aHR: 1. 48; 95 % CI: 1. 14 to 1. 92; p = 0. 003). However, there was no significant difference between patients undergoing CABG with CR and those undergoing PCI with CR regarding the risk for death from any cause (aHR: 1. 16; 95 % CI: 0. 83 to 1. 63; p = 0. 39) and the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke (aHR: 1. 14; 95 % CI: 0. 87 to 1. 48; p = 0. 35). Subgroup analysis of multivessel coronary disease, <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (> 32), and diabetes showed consistent findings. CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of left main or multivessel coronary artery disease, PCI resulting in CR was associated with a similar long-term survival rate to CABG resulting in CR. Therefore, the ability to achieve CR should enter into the decision algorithm for choice of revascularization strategy.

This study aims to clarify whether <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> affects the outcome of bypass grafting as defined by major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events (MACCE) and its components over a 2 -year follow-up period. MethodsOf the 3075 patients enrolled in SYNTAX, 1541 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (897 randomized controlled trial patients, and 644 registry patients). All patients undergoing bypass grafting were stratified according to their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> into 3 tertiles: low (0 – 22), intermediate (22 – 32), and high (≥ 33) complexity. Clinical outcomes up to 2 years after allocation were determined for each group and further risk factor analysis was performed. ResultsRegistry patients had more complex disease {{than those in the}} randomized controlled trial (SYNTAX score: registry 37. 8 ± 13. 3 vs randomized 29. 1 ± 11. 4; P < . 001). At 30 days, overall coronary bypass mortality was 0. 9 % (registry 0. 6 % vs randomized 1. 2 %). MACCE rate at 30 days was 4. 4 % (registry 3. 4 % vs randomized 5. 2 %). <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> did not significantly affect overall 2 -year MACCE rate of 15. 6 % for low, 14. 3 % for medium, and 15. 4 % for <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores.</b> Compared with randomized patients, registry patients had a lower rate of overall MACCE rate (registry 13. 0 % vs randomized 16. 7 %; P = . 046) and repeat revascularization (4. 7 % vs 8. 6 %; P = . 003), whereas other event rates were comparable.

Background: RA is {{an effective way to}} mechanically modify heavily calcified lesions before stenting; however its outcomes are not well defined. Methods and Results: Retrospective evaluation of all patients who underwent RA in three large UK centers (Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS)) from March 2005 to January 2013. Five hundred and eighteen patients had RA with median follow-up period of 22 months. About 68. 3 % were male, 28. 7 % had DM and 34. 6 % were treated because of ACS. Stents were deployed in 97. 3 % of the patients while 30. 7 % of the procedures were performed transradially. Maximum burr was ≤ 1. 75 mm in 85. 5 % and the mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 19. 5 [*]±[*] 11. 6. Peri-procedural complications occurred in 6. 4 % and vascular access complications in 1. 9 %. Outcomes in the follow-up period were: MACE 17. 8 %, cardiac death 7. 1 %, MI 11. 7 %, TVR 7. 5 %, all-cause death 13. 7 %, definite stent thrombosis (ST) 1. 4 % and stroke 2. 9 %. Patients with intermediate and <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were more likely to suffer MACE, cardiac death, MI, all-cause death and ST. Patients with a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 32 {{were also more likely to}} have a peri-procedural complication.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Identifying {{risk factors}} for acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) is important for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Abnormal platelet parameters, mainly platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) {{are thought to be}} among these risk factors because platelet activation plays a pivotal role in ACS. PDW is a more specific marker of platelet activation, since it does not increase during simple platelet swelling. In this study, the comparison of risk factors along with the PDW between Non ST-Elevation ACS (NSTEACS) and ST-Elevation ACS (STEACS) were investigated. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, patients with ACS that admitted at dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo General Hospital Makassar since December 2014 to March 2015 who undergo coronary angiography were enrolled. All data variables were taken according to the medical record. PDW was taken on first blood examination at hospital admission. Data was significant if p-value < 0. 05 and wasprocessed with SPSS version 16. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were enrolled. There were significantly higher PDW (p= 0. 047) in STEACS group (13. 7 ± 2. 0 fL) than in NSTEACS group (12. 6 ± 2. 3 fL). There were a significant positive correlation between PDW value and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (Pearson, r= 0. 552, p= 0. 000).

We aimed to assess infarct size and left ventricular function in patients undergoing immediate compared with staged CR for multivessel disease at PPCI. METHODS: The Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) substudy of CvLPRIT was a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint trial in PPCI patients with multivessel disease. These data refer to a post-hoc analysis in 93 patients randomized to the CR arm (63 immediate, 30 staged) who completed a pre-discharge CMR scan (median 2 and 4  days respectively) after PPCI. The decision to stage non-IRA revascularization was {{at the discretion of}} the treating interventional cardiologist. RESULTS: Patients treated with a staged approach had more visible thrombus (26 / 30 vs. 31 / 62, p[*]=[*] 0. 001), <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in the IRA (9. 5, 8 - 16 vs. 8. 0, 5. 5 - 11, p[*]=[*] 0. 04) and a greater incidence of no-reflow (23. 3  % vs. 1. 6  % p[*]<[*] 0. 001) than those treated with immediate CR. After adjustment for confounders, staged patients had larger infarct size (19. 7  % [11. 7 - 37. 6] vs. 11. 6  % [6. 8 - 18. 2] of LV Mass, p[*]=[*] 0. 012) and lower ejection fraction (42. 2 [*]±[*] 10  % vs. 47. 4 [*]±[*] 9  %, p[*]=[*] 0. 019) compared with immediate CR.

Aims To prospectively assess the agreement between the HT decision and the SSII recommendation regarding the revascularization strategy in patients with 3 -vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) of the SYNTAX II trial. Methods The SSII predicts the 4 -year mortality of an individual patient both after PCI and after CABG. Patients were treated by PCI when the SSII predicted a mortality risk favoring PCI or when risk predictions were equipoise between PCI and CABG. However, the HT could overrule the SSII and recommend either CABG or PCI. Results A total of 202 patients have been screened and 24 did not fulfill inclusion criteria. The median age was 67. 0 (IQR 59. 0 - 73. 3), and 167 (82. 7 %) were male. The HT endorsed SSII treatment recommendation, for CABG or PCI, in 152 patients (85. 4 %). Three patients had preference for PCI, irrespective of the HT decision. The main reason for the HT to overrule the SSII and recommend CABG was {{the prospect of a}} more complete revascularization (21 of 25 patients).

BackgroundNew-generation DES are considered the standard-of-care in patients with CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, there are few data investigating the effects of new- over early-generation DES according to the anatomic complexity of CAD. MethodsPatient-level data from 4 contemporary, all-comers trials were pooled. The primary device-oriented clinical endpoint was the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target-lesion revascularization (TLR). The principal effectiveness and safety endpoints were TLR and definite stent thrombosis (ST), respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{aimed to}} update the Logistic Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> to predict 3 -year {{survival}} after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and compare the performance with the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone. BACKGROUND The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> is a well-established angiographic tool to predict long-term outcomes after PCI. The Logistic Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> developed by combining clinical variables with the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> {{has been shown to}} perform better than the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone in predicting 1 -year outcomes after PCI. However, the ability of this score to predict long-term survival is unknown. METHODS Patient-level data (N = 6, 304, 399 deaths within 3 years) from 7 contemporary PCI trials were analyzed. We revised the overall risk and the predictor effects in the core model (<b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular ejection fraction) using Cox regression analysis to predict mortality at 3 years. We also updated the extended model by combining the core model with additional independent predictors of 3 -year mortality (i. e., diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and body mass index). RESULTS The revised Logistic Clinical SYNTAX models showed better discriminative ability than the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> for the prediction of 3 -year mortality after PCI (c-index: <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> 0. 61; core model, 0. 71; and extended model, 0. 73 in a cross-validation procedure). The extended model in particular performed better in differentiating low- and intermediate-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS Risk scores combining clinical characteristics with the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> substantially better predict 3 -year mortality than the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone and should be used for long-term risk stratification of patients undergoing PCI...|$|R
