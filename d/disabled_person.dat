The final year of the UN Decade of <b>Disabled</b> <b>Persons,</b> 1992, the significant law for <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> the Magna Carta for <b>Disabled</b> <b>Persons,</b> was passed. The Act provides for the rehabilitation, self-development and self-reliance of <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and their integration {{into the mainstream of}} society and for other purposes. The significances of the Magna Carta lies in the following points. 1) It defines the rights and privileges of <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> in the area of employment, educatiton, health, telecommunications, accessibility, and social services. 2) It recongnizes and supports the excerise of political and civil rights, including the right to vote, organize and assemble. 3) It defines and prohibits the conditions that constitute discrimination against <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> in the field of employment, transportation, and public accomodations. 4) It includes other provision to housing, tax, government supports of NGOs for/of the disabled.

25|$|Implementing {{appropriate}} proxemic cues {{has been}} shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see active listening). Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or perceived distance between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of instructional videoconferencing, using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom). Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with stigmatized minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.|$|E
25|$|Social norms {{can also}} be {{observed}} everywhere people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. Lawrence Lessig describes how social norms can regulate behavior in cyberspace: through an individual's perceptions from the (physical or virtual) surrounding community. For example, if a <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, {{can also be}} applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.|$|E

John Beifuss compared her performance to Eddie Redmayne's act as Stephen Hawking in the biographical drama, The Theory of Everything, in his review for The Commercial Appeal. He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. The view was echoed by Variety critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range. Koechlin won several accolades for the film, including the Best Actress Award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Jury Award at the 63rd National Film Awards. Additionally, she had garnered nominations for Best Actress at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Asian Film Awards.|$|E

The subjects of this study were 50 masters degree students at The University of Arizona. All subjects were volunteers and were enrolled in the Rehabilitation Counseling graduate program.
