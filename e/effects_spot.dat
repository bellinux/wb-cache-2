40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the goals and}} research program leading to the Heavy Ion Integrated Research Experiment (IRE). They review the basic constraints which lead to a design and give examples of parameters and capabilities of an IRE. We also show design tradeoffs generated by the systems code IBEAM. A multi-pronged Phase 1 research effort is {{laying the groundwork for}} the Integrated Research Experiment. Experiment, technology development, theory, simulation, and systems studies are all playing major roles in this Phase I research. The key research areas are: (1) Source and injector (for investigation of a high brightness, multiple beam, low cost injector); (2) High current transport (to examine effects at full driver-scale line charge density, including the maximization of the beam filling-factor and control of electrons); (3) Enabling technology development (low cost and high performance magnetic core material, superconducting magnetic quadrupole arrays, insulators, and pulsers); and (4) Beam simulations and theory (for investigations of beam matching, specification of accelerator errors, studies of emittance growth, halo, and bunch compression, in the accelerator, and neutralization methods, stripping <b>effects,</b> <b>spot</b> size minimization in the chamber); and (5) Systems optimization (minimization of cost and maximization of pulse energy and beam intensity). They have begun the process of designing, simulating, and optimizing the next major heavy-ion induction accelerator, the IRE. This accelerator facility will, in turn, help provide the basis to proceed to {{the next step in the}} development of IFE as an attractive source of fusion energy...|$|E

30|$|As two {{nanoparticles}} {{are brought}} {{close to each}} other, the enhanced electric field concentrates in the gap of the dimer. This phenomenon is known as hot <b>spot</b> <b>effect</b> which originates from the LSPR coupling effect between the nanoparticles. The dimers with remarkable hot <b>spot</b> <b>effects</b> can be easily prepared by e-beam lithography [12], nanosphere lithography [13], and self-assembly method [14, 15]. For the self-assembly method, metal nanoparticles with specific geometries are linked through the molecules with particular groups. Therefore, {{the gap in the}} dimer is as narrow as the molecular chain length. This further reduces the gap between two nanoparticles and causes a more remarkable hot <b>spot</b> <b>effect</b> [16 – 18].|$|R

40|$|Spotted {{knapweed}} (Centaurea stoebe L. subsp. Micranthos (Gugler) Hayek) {{was first}} introduced in the 1890 s from Europe into western North America, where it now occupies over three million hectares of rangeland and pasture in 14 states and two Canadian provinces, reducing forage production and causing economic damage. Despite many reported <b>effects</b> <b>spotted</b> knapweed can have on soils and native vegetation, {{it is not known}} whether patch size is correlated with these ecosystem-level effects. The objective of our study was to determine whether the <b>effects</b> of <b>spotted</b> knapweed on plant composition and soil properties was related to spotted knapweed patch size. We asked the following questions: (1) Are there differences in plant species richness and diversity between small and large knapweed patches? and (2) Do soil water and soil mineral nutrient properties change depending on knapweed patch size? Twentyfour knapweed patches, and paired natural grassland plots, were randomly selected within Lac du Bois Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. Knapweed patch size ranged from 6 to 366 m 2. Sampling and analysis revealed a significant effect of knapweed patch size on soil and vegetation properties. Soil P, soil temperature, and total dry plant biomass (g/ 0. 25 m 2) increased, while soil N, soil C, and soil moisture decreased with patch size. Since our results show that spotted knapweed patch size is related to degree of soil alteration, {{it is important to consider}} size of patch when modeling the impact of spotted knapweed in North America. Since large patches of spotted knapweed seem to have a proportionately greater effect on soil chemistry properties, large patches may move the system further away from a point where it is possible to restore the site to pre-invasion conditions.

40|$|Whilst the {{benefits}} of forward contracting {{for goods and services}} have been extensively researched in terms of mitigating market power <b>effects</b> in <b>spot</b> markets, we analyse how the risk in spot price formation induces a counteracting premium in the contract prices. We consider and test a wide-ranging set of propositions, involving fundamental, behavioural, dynamic, market conduct and shock components, on a long data set from the most liquid of European electricity forward markets, the EEX. We show that much of what is conventionally regarded as the market price of risk in electricity is actually that of its underlying fuel commodity, gas; that market power has a double effect on prices, insofar as it increases spot prices and induces a forward premium; that oil price sentiment spills over and that the premium reacts to scarcity and the higher moments of spot price uncertainty. We observe that considerations of the scale and determinants of the forward premium are at least as important as the market power <b>effects</b> in <b>spot</b> market price formation when evaluating the efficiency of wholesale power trading.

40|$|Local laser {{ablation}} of the cathode of OLEDs {{has been applied}} to create a population of pinholes of the same size. This enables the direct comparison at different conditions of black spots and grey spots in the emission of OLEDs as a result of water ingress into the device. We confirmed earlier observations on the operational <b>effect</b> of black <b>spot</b> growth as determined in a sequential test on particle induced pinholes. Furthermore, we measured the operational effect in parallel, providing data that are test independent. With the same population of pinholes we studied the operational <b>effect</b> of grey <b>spot</b> growth. The observed larger operational <b>effect</b> of grey <b>spot</b> growth with respect to that of black spot growth is attributed to a lateral flow of protons to the centre of the black spot. In this part of the black spot a depletion region is present which is created by transport of H 3 O+ to the cathode {{under the influence of the}} applied electric field.

40|$|Banana fruit (Musa cavendishii [Musa acuminata] AA Group cv. Sucrier) {{were placed}} in trays and held at 29 - 30 degreesC. Covering the trays with 'Sun wrap' {{polyvinyl}} chloride film prevented the early senescent peel spotting, typical for this cultivar. Carbon dioxide and ethylene concentrations within the packages increased, but inclusion of carbon dioxide scrubbers or ethylene absorbents, which considerably affected gas composition, had no <b>effect</b> on <b>spotting.</b> Experiments with continuous low oxygen concentrations confirmed {{that the effect of}} the package was mainly due to low oxygen. Relative humidity was higher in the packages but this had no <b>effect</b> on <b>spotting.</b> The positive <b>effect</b> of modified atmosphere packaging on peel spotting was accompanied by reduced in vitro phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity in the peel, and by an increase of in vitro polyphenol oxidase (PPO; catechol oxidase) activity. We conclude that senescent spotting of banana peel requires rather high oxygen levels. It is not known which reaction becomes limiting for spotting, at low oxygen levels. Whatever the mechanism, the increase of in vitro PPO activity apparently shows an increase in potentially active protein. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA 1 °-spot was flashed up on a screen, {{followed}} by a snugly fitting annular mask. We measured the amount of masking {{as a function of}} stimulus luminance. The surround was always mid-gray, the masking ring was either black or white, and the luminance of the spot target ranged from 0 % to 100 % of white in 4 % steps. Observers reported the apparent lightness of the masked spot by adjusting a matching spot. Results: A black annular mask made all spots that were darker than the gray surround appear to be transparent, that is, of the same luminance as the surround (complete masking). The black ring had virtually no masking <b>effect</b> on <b>spots</b> that were lighter than the surround. Conversely, a white ring made all spots that were lighter than the gray surround look apparently the same luminance as the surround (complete masking), but had virtually no masking <b>effect</b> on <b>spots</b> that were darker than the surround. In summary, a black ring masked spatial decrements but not increments, whilst a white ring masked spatial increments but not decrements. Thus masking occurred only when the spot and the ring had the same luminance polarity. This same-polarity masking still occurred when the target spot was larger than the ‘donut hole’ of the masking ring, so that the target and ring partly overlapped. This ruled out simple edge-cancellation theories. Instead, masking disrupts the filling-in process that normally propagates inward from the edges of a spot [Vision Res. 31 (7 – 8) (1991) 1221]. We conclude that metacontrast masking occurs within, but not between, separate visual ON and OFF pathways...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made recently in our understanding of the structure of stellar magnetic fields, thanks to advances in detection methods such as Zeeman-Doppler Imaging. The extrapolation of this surface magnetic field into the corona has provided 3 D models of the coronal magnetic field and plasma. This method is sensitive mainly to the magnetic field in the bright regions of the stellar surface. The dark (spotted) regions are censored because the Zeeman signature there is suppressed. By modelling the magnetic field that might have been contained in these spots, we have studied the effect that this loss of information might have on our understanding of the coronal structure. As examples, we have chosen two stars (V 374 peg and AB Dor) that have very different magnetograms and patterns of spot coverage. We find that the <b>effect</b> of the <b>spot</b> field depends not only on the relative amount of flux in the spots, but also its distribution across the stellar surface. For a star such as AB Dor with a high spot coverage and a large polar spot, at its greatest <b>effect</b> the <b>spot</b> field may almost double the fraction of the flux that is open (hence decreasing the spindown time) {{while at the same time}} increasing the X-ray emission measure by two orders of magnitude and significantly affecting the X-ray rotational modulation.
