40|$|Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare how the barriers that women face related to promotions differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland, to explore the various strategies that can be taken to break the glass ceiling, and to explore various benefits that individual women <b>and</b> organizations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland could gain if the glass ceiling was broken. Summary Women comprise approximately half of <b>the</b> workforce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland, but {{only a small percentage of}} these women are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corporations’ senior management positions. There are many barriers that women face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland that prevent them from reaching those positions. It is acknowledged that there are strategies that could be implemented to shatter the glass ceiling, which would bring individuals and organizations benefits in these two respective countries. Conclusion Although the background situation of the glass ceiling and the barriers that women face are relatively similar both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland, there is a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> representation of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> senior management positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Finland. This difference could be explained by political differences...|$|R
