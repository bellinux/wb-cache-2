This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> {{to attend to the}} electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have {{to be thought of as}} an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.|$|E

Featuring art by a rotating group of artists including Carlos Pacheco, Alan Davis, and Chris Sprouse, the series is led by Agent Phil Coulson, and sees the canonical introduction of the characters Melinda May, Jemma Simmons, and Leo Fitz—who originated from the television series—to the Marvel comics universe, who Waid noted would be given [...] "the Marvel Universe spin." [...] Waid described the series as [...] "done-in-one. Coulson {{and his team have}} a mission, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> someone for a mission, everyone in the Marvel Universe is available as a potential Agent." [...] Waid added that though the comic does not share events with the television series, it will maintain the characters' relationships and personalities. Marc Guggenheim relaunched the comic as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for Marvel Comics' All-New, All-Different Marvel line, and introduced the television series' character Grant Ward to the Marvel comic universe in May 2016.|$|E

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, {{this sounds like a}} Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know?

The couple also appeared on the syndicated television show Divorce Court in April 2009.

On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance in New York of This Beautiful City, a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community. In August 2009, Haggard told Charisma magazine: [...] "I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. I fell into sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented." [...] He also extols the benefits of qualified counselors: [...] "I highly recommend qualified Christian counseling... for anyone losing their fight with any kind of compulsive thoughts or behaviors. ...
