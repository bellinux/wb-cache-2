That is the lesson {{to be drawn from}} the past few decades’ work on the commercial law of investment securities. Article 8 is the first article of the Uniform Commercial Code to reach a third generation. There is the original version, the 1978 version, and now the 1994 version. The original version was based on the traditional system in which buyers and sellers effected transfer of securities by physical delivery of certificates. The 1978 version added new provisions dealing with “uncertificated securities. ” Then the 1994 version recast the law to deal more adequately with the system of securities holding through intermediaries. In this essay, the author argues that as significant legal objects change, so too must the legal language affiliated with those objects.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} on how {{to facilitate}} paperless trade for international supply chain integration in the Asia and Pacific region. The paper defines paperless trade and describes how paperless trade can improve efficiency of international supply chain, including its economic benefits. Based on the review of paperless trade initiatives and assessment of paperless trade readiness of countries in the Asia and Pacific region, the paper identifies five critical challenges in facilitating cross-border paperless trade: use of common international standards, harmonization of different legal frameworks, capacity gaps among the parties, cooperation {{between the public and}} private sectors, and lack of coordination mechanisms for cross-border data exchanges. For each challenge, the paper describes its nature and possible measures for alleviating it. In its annexes, the paper also provides implementation cases of cross-border paperless trade in the Asia and Pacific region, namely Pan Asian e-Commerce Alliance (PAA) and <b>electronic</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Origin between the Republic of Korea and Taipei,China...|$|E

As more people are beginning to log on, the range of abilities of the internet is starting to diversify, from online auction sites, shopping at home, and of course, doing banking through the Internet. However, there was an Internet banking hacking incident, which two hacked into the Internet banking system of a local bank by installing a program to find out personal identification numbers (PIN) and <b>electronic</b> <b>certificate</b> information used for Internet banking. The hackers used a hacking program installed at a computer on a PC room, which is very common in Korea, when hackers visited a certain Web site with the computer. The victim used Internet banking without knowing the installed program was sending his PIN number and personal information to the hackers. The program used the ‘key stroke ’ method, which sends hackers whatever the victim types on the keyboard. And also there should be prompt precautions for new type of financial fraud, "phising", a technique whereby the websites of known institutions are entirely or partly copied and e-mails are used to obtain private or confidential data of the customers of those institutions and this fraud affects users ’ credibility on online banking system. Internet banking seems to be the way of the future, and with the rapid advances of technology and the internet, online banking will continue to grow. Therefore it is very important and imminent issue to build safe and reliable environment. So, in this paper, vulnerabilities in Internet banking system are analyzed and several measures for trust building of internet banking are suggested...|$|E

New technology [...] notably the shift from a paper to an electronic process for recording vital events and transmitting the data to public agencies [...] is creating opportunities to produce more timely, accurate, and useful information. The furthest advanced innovation is the <b>electronic</b> birth <b>certificate.</b> At the same time, changes in welfare policy and health care [...] including efforts to establish paternity at the time of birth and to improve health care outcomes [...] are creating pressures for more policy-relevant data about vital events.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Electronic death {{certification}} {{was established}} in France in 2007. A methodology based on intrinsic characteristics of death certificates was designed to compare the quality of electronic versus paper death certificates. METHODS: All death certificates from the 2010 French mortality database were included. Three specific quality indicators were considered: (i) amount of information, measured {{by the number of}} causes of death coded on the death certificate; (ii) intrinsic consistency, explored by application of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) General Principle, using an international automatic coding system (Iris); (iii) imprecision, measured by proportion of death certificates where the selected underlying cause of death was imprecise. Multivariate models were considered: a truncated Poisson model for indicator (i) and binomial models for indicators (ii) and (iii). Adjustment variables were age, gender, and cause, place, and region of death. RESULTS: 533, 977 death certificates were analyzed. After adjustment, <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> contained 19 % [17 %- 20 %] more codes than paper death certificates for people deceased under 65 years, and 12 % [11 %- 13 %] more codes for people deceased over 65 years. Regarding deceased under and over 65 respectively, the ICD General Principle could be applied 2 % [0 %- 4 %] and 6 % [5 %- 7 %] more to electronic than to paper death certificates. The proportion of imprecise death certificates was 51 % [46 %- 56 %] lower for electronic than for paper death certificates. CONCLUSION: The method proposed to evaluate the quality of death certificates is easily reproducible in countries using an automatic coding system. According to our criteria, <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> are better completed than paper death certificates. The transition to <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> is positive in many aspects and should be promoted...|$|R
40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded seven states, {{including}} Kentucky, {{to clarify}} statewide death certification practices in sudden, unexpected infant death and compare state performances with national expectations. Accurate assignment {{of the cause}} and manner of death in cases of sudden, unexpected infant death is critical for accurate vital statistics data to direct limited resources to appropriate targets, and to implement optimal and safe risk reduction strategies. The primary objectives are to (1) Compare SUID death certifications recommended by the KY medical examiners with the stated cause of death text field on the hard copy death <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> and (2) Compare KY and national SUID rates. Causes of death for SUID cases recommended by the medical examiners and those appearing on the hard copy and <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> in KY were collected retrospectively for 2004 and 2005. Medical examiner recommendations were based upon a classification scheme devised by them in 2003. Coroners hard copy death certificates {{and the cause of}} death rates in KY were compared to those occurring nationally. Eleven percent of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly did not undergo autopsy during the study interval. The KY 2003 classification scheme for SIDS is at variance with the NICHD and San Diego SIDS definitions. Significant differences in causes of death recommended by medical examiners and those appearing on the hard copy and <b>electronic</b> death <b>certificates</b> were identified. SIDS rates increased in KY in contrast to decreasing rates nationally. Nationwide adoption of a widely used SIDS definition, such as that proposed in San Diego in 2004 as well as legislation by states to ensure autopsy in all cases of sudden unexpected infant death are recommended. Medical examiners’ recommendations for cause of death should appear on death certificates.
