5|$|January 7: First RaLa test using exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators.</b>|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical <b>detonators</b> was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 <b>detonators</b> each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of <b>detonators</b> manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E
5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} <b>detonators</b> {{and solid}} pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The electric <b>detonators</b> showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E

50|$|The {{rear part}} of a <b>detonator</b> is usually made of a rigid but {{malleable}} aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of <b>detonator</b> crimping pliers mate the <b>detonator</b> with the initiation source by allowing the <b>detonator's</b> back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping {{the neck of the}} <b>detonator.</b> This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|R

5|$|In 1999 the {{organisation}} supplemented its equipment by importing arms from Croatia, including military explosive TM500, CZ Model 25 submachine guns, modified AK-47 assault rifles with a folding stock, and RPG-18 and RPG-22 rocket launchers but a July 2000 attempt to smuggle a second consignment of arms was foiled by Croatian police, who seized seven RPG-18s, AK-47 assault rifles, <b>detonators,</b> ammunition, and twenty packs of TM500.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 RIRA members {{travelled}} to Slovakia {{to procure}} arms, and {{were caught in}} a sting operation by the British security agency MI5. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes of plastic explosives, 2,000 <b>detonators,</b> 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also wire-guided missiles and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game, Dark Forces, {{the focus is}} on combat against various creatures and {{characters}} from the Star Wars universe, and includes environmental puzzles and hazards, whilst following a central storyline outlined in mission briefings and cutscenes. For combat, the player may use fists, explosive land mines and thermal <b>detonators,</b> as well as blasters and other ranged weapons, with the gameplay leaning more towards ranged combat.|$|E

50|$|High-explosives trains can {{be either}} two-step (e.g., <b>detonator</b> and dynamite) or three-step (e.g., <b>detonator,</b> booster of primary explosive, and main charge of {{secondary}} explosive).|$|R
50|$|When a <b>detonator</b> is delivered, it is {{sometimes}} delivered {{as a piece of}} metal with nothing connected to it. To function, the <b>detonator</b> must be mated with the correct initiation source. The correct initiation source could for example be tar-fuse for time delay, or a Shock tube <b>detonator</b> to name a few.|$|R
5|$|Project Camel was the codename {{given to}} work {{performed}} by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) {{in support of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II. These activities included the development of <b>detonators</b> and other equipment, testing of bomb shapes dropped from Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, and the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, where explosive components of nuclear weapons were manufactured.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{initially}} took {{small amounts}} of materiel from Provisional IRA arms dumps {{under the control of}} McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the plastic explosive Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, <b>detonators,</b> and timing devices. The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200lb shell.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{signal was}} a fast dip, {{corresponding to the}} compression of the cadmium sphere, followed by slower increase, corresponding to the decompression and following dispersal of the sphere and the lanthanum. The differences between the four traces on the oscilloscope display, each indicating the average compression {{in the direction of}} the detector, allowed the assessment of the required synchronization accuracy for the <b>detonators.</b>|$|E
50|$|As a rule, most purpose-made {{military}} booby-trap firing devices {{contain some}} form of spring-loaded firing pin designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a <b>detonator</b> at one end. The <b>detonator</b> is inserted into an explosive charge e.g. C4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g. by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked firing pin which flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing both it and the attached <b>detonator.</b> The resulting shock-wave from the <b>detonator</b> sets off the main explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|After his long-lost {{daughter}} {{was killed by}} the Reign (policemen under Waters' control), Sandman confronts Waters who gives him the <b>detonator.</b> As Spider-Man is battling a series of Venom symbiotes, Sandman gives him the <b>detonator</b> before allowing himself to be devoured by the symbiotes. Spider-Man presses the <b>detonator,</b> causing {{the rest of the}} Six to presumably explode.|$|R

5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ohio's Miami University, {{he received his}} doctorate from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, in 1941. He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, where he researched naval mines. In 1943, he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, he worked with scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky {{on the development of}} the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators</b> required by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, {{and turned}} to selling {{underwater}} electrical <b>detonators</b> and waterproof cable of his own invention. Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|For combat, {{the player}} may use fists, {{explosive}} land mines and thermal <b>detonators,</b> {{as well as}} blasters and other ranged weapons. All player weapons except the fist require ammunition, which can be collected in power-ups. All weapons, again {{with the exception of}} the fist, have a secondary mode which makes it have a different effect than in primary mode. The player has health and shields which are damaged by enemy attacks and some environmental hazards, and may be replenished through power-ups.|$|E
50|$|The All-ways fuze was {{composed}} of a free-floating striker and <b>detonator</b> combination held apart by a weak spring. On top of this assembly was a steel ball bearing pressed against a conical housing by the striker. Any impact in the vertical axis would impart acceleration to either the striker or the <b>detonator,</b> causing the firing pin to contact and ignite the <b>detonator.</b> Any impact in the horizontal axis would cause the ball bearing to follow {{the slope of the}} conical housing converting the horizontal acceleration into a vertical one, touching off the <b>detonator</b> as before.|$|R
40|$|The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIV, NSWC) is {{conducting}} a qualification program for a laser-ignited, all-secondary (DDT) explosive <b>detonator.</b> This <b>detonator</b> was developed jointly by IHDIV, NSWC and the Department of Energy's EG&G Mound Applied Technologies facility in Miamisburg, Ohio to accept a laser initiation signal and produce a fully developed shock wave output. The <b>detonator</b> performance requirements were established by the on-going IHDIV, NSWC Laser Initiated Transfer Energy Subsystem (LITES) advanced development program. Qualification of the <b>detonator</b> as a component utilizing existing military specifications is the selected approach for this program. The <b>detonator</b> is a deflagration-to-detonator transfer (DDT) device using a secondary explosive, HMX, to generate the required shock wave output. The prototype development and initial system integration tests for the LITES and for the <b>detonator</b> were reported at the 1992 International Pyrotechnics Society Symposium and at the 1992 Survival and Flight Equipment National Symposium. Recent results are presented for the all-fire sensitivity and qualification tests conducted at two different laser initiation pulses...|$|R
40|$|A semiautomatic grinder was {{designed}} and built at Mound Laboratory to grind molded plastic <b>detonator</b> heads to close tolerances. It uses a vertical spindle, dry grinding technique to decrease grinding time of some diallyl phthalate (DAP) <b>detonator</b> heads with wire inserts and to eliminate the problem of error in repeatability which is characteristic of the manual grinding process. The semiautomatic grinder is essentially air-operated with electrical control and was primarily designed using standard components for ease of manufacture and maintenance. As development of the semiautomatic grinder progressed, DAP <b>detonator</b> heads with wire inserts ground using the manual surface grinder were evaluated along with {{the same type of}} <b>detonator</b> heads ground using the semiautomatiac grinder. Also, a time study was conducted to determine the cost savings of grinding miniature DAP <b>detonator</b> heads with wire inserts using the semiautomatic grinder. Inspection and analytical results and radiographic sections of ground <b>detonator</b> head surfaces from each grinding technique indicated that the semiautomatic grinding technique provides acceptable ground DAP <b>detonator</b> heads with wire inserts at a cost savings of 83. 5 % and a significant reduction in grinding time...|$|R
5|$|In June 2006, the PSNI made arrests {{following}} an MI5 sting operation targeting a dissident republican gun smuggling plot. The RIRA {{had attempted to}} procure arms from France including Semtex and C-4 plastic explosives, SA-7 surface-to-air missiles, AK-47s, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols with silencers, anti-tank weapons and <b>detonators.</b> On 30 June 2010, two of those arrested were found guilty following a trial by judge in Belfast. On 1 October 2010 one man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for attempting to import weapons and explosives, while the other was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for making a Portuguese property available {{for the purpose of}} terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} key {{component}} of the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin <b>detonators.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early Y-1222 model Fat Man was {{assembled}} {{with some}} 1,500 bolts. This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944. This redesign work was substantial, {{and only the}} Y-1222 tail design was retained. Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no <b>detonators</b> at all. The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{his doctorate}} from Caltech, Bradner {{worked at the}} US Naval Ordnance Laboratory where he researched naval mines until 1943. He was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project in 1943 at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, which helped to develop the first atomic bomb. Bradner helped to develop {{a wide range of}} technology needed for the bomb, including research on the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire <b>detonators</b> needed to implode the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering mechanism, and even helped design the new town around the laboratory. He worked closely {{with some of the most}} prominent scientists including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky. He witnessed the Trinity test, the first nuclear weapons test, at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine <b>detonators,</b> the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact <b>detonators.</b> The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
