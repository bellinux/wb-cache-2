5|$|The minimum central {{pressure}} of these storms is, {{for the most}} part, estimated from satellite imagery using the Dvorak technique. In the case of Kenna, Ava, and Patricia, the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> storm. Because of the estimation of central pressures, {{it is possible that}} other storms more intense than these have formed.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> path of the other drivers.|$|E

5|$|Early on September 10, the eyewall {{became less}} defined, the {{convection}} near the eye became eroded, and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted. As a result, Isabel weakened slightly to a Category3 hurricane. The hurricane turned {{more to the}} west due {{to the influence of}} the Bermuda-Azores High. Later on September 10, Isabel restrengthened to a Category4 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall. The hurricane continued to intensify, and Isabel reached its peak intensity of 165mph (270km/h) on September 11, a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Isabel weakened slightly, though it retained Category5 status for 24hours. As Isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened, and early on September 13 Isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane. A weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest. After completing the replacement cycle, the hurricane's large 40mile (65km) wide eye became better defined, and late on the 13th Isabel re-attained Category5 status. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance Aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of , the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an Atlantic hurricane. Cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter, and Isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane early on September 14. Later that day, it re-organized, and for the third time it attained Category5 status while located 400miles (650km) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|A {{reconnaissance}} aircraft <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> typhoon near its peak intensity on September 12 determined Nancy's one-minute sustained winds to be 185knots (215mph; 345km/h). If {{these values are}} reliable, {{they would be the}} highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone. However, it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive. Thus, Nancy's winds may actually be lower than its official best-track value. In 2016, reanalysis of Hurricane Patricia noted that the storm had 215mph (345km/h) sustained winds, which ties Nancy and is the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) which alerts the pilots if {{the aircraft}} is in immediate danger of <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground or an obstacle, the investigators determined {{that it had been}} malfunctioning during at least 85 of the last 234 flights of the aircraft. The unit was previously fitted in Atlasjet's other MD-83 aircraft (registered TC-AKN) but it had been switched a week prior to the accident. Although the malfunction of the GPWS unit was known to the airline and the DGCA, it was not properly logged in the maintenance records in order to go undetected.|$|E

However, two weeks later at Richmond, Earnhardt finished 27th. He was again spun out late in the race at Darlington and ended the race in 27th place.

Over the next week he was reported to have shot down two Dorniers Do 17 bombers, damaging two more. On 14 September he was assigned a courier mission, delivering messages to General Juliusz Rómmel, and Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły, <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> encircled pocket at Młynów.

500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes.

George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and pork chops could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and on about how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 July 1905, Benningtons crew was {{preparing}} her to sail {{to the aid of}} the monitor [...] which had broken down and was in need of a tow. After her crew had finished the difficult task of coaling the ship that morning, most of them were belowdecks cleaning themselves from the dirty job. Unbeknownst to anyone on board, three problems with one of Benningtons boilers – oily feed water, an improperly closed steam valve, and a faulty steam gauge – were conspiring against them. At about 10:30, excessive steam pressure in the boiler resulted in a boiler explosion that rocked the ship, sending men and equipment <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. The escaping steam sprayed through the living compartments and decks. The explosion opened Benningtons hull to the sea, and she began to list to starboard. Quick actions by the tug Santa Fe — taking Bennington under tow and beaching her – almost certainly saved the gunboat from sinking.|$|E

At its weakest, the storm's highest winds were found far from the center, likely generated more by the increasing pressure gradient in relation to an anticyclone to the north than by the low pressure center itself.|$|E

500|$|By lap 59, Verstappen on {{the fast}} super-soft tyres was chasing Lotus driver Romain Grosjean for tenth position, with Verstappen making several {{attempts}} to pass over the following laps. At the beginning of lap 64, coming into turn one, Verstappen crashed {{into the back of}} the Lotus, sending him <b>flying</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barriers. While he was able to walk away from the accident without injuries, a [...] "Virtual Safety Car" [...] condition was called by the race director to allow marshals to safely recover the damaged car. This was the first time a Virtual Safety Car had been used in Formula One. Shortly thereafter, the regular safety car was sent out on track. Lewis Hamilton, who had been leading the race by almost twenty seconds, was pitted apparently with the intention of returning him to the track ahead of his pursuers. The Mercedes pitwall crew, however, miscalculated the gap allowing Rosberg to take the lead while Hamilton emerged from the pit exit lane marginally behind Vettel who had stayed out under the safety car behind Rosberg. With the safety car coming into the pit lane on lap 70 of 78, Rosberg retained the lead unchallenged going on to win the Monaco Grand Prix for a third consecutive time whereas Hamilton finished third, unable to overtake Vettel for second position. Daniel Ricciardo had also made a pit stop under the safety car, and on fresh tyres he was able to pass Kimi Räikkönen in controversial circumstances. His teammate Kvyat then let him past in order to give him the chance to try and pass third-placed Hamilton. When Ricciardo was unable to overtake, he handed fourth place back to Kvyat. Ricciardo set the fastest lap of the race in the process. Jenson Button finished eighth, scoring four championship points for himself and the McLaren team, the first points for the renewed McLaren-Honda partnership since their return at the start of the 2015 season.|$|E
