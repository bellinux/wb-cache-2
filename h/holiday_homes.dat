5|$|Many of the <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> {{were never}} {{designed}} for long-term residence {{and are now}} in a state of disrepair. According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{marketed as}} <b>holiday</b> <b>homes,</b> {{many of the}} {{original}} houses became permanent residences due to post-war housing shortages in London and by 1950 {{there was a significant}} year-round population. Jaywick now includes large numbers of retired and unemployed people. A 2011 report in The Guardian found that 62% of working age residents in Jaywick received benefits, compared to 15% national average. A subsequent report in 2015 reiterated the area {{was one of the most}} deprived English neighbourhoods. According to the Citizens Advice Bureau, 40% of residents are unable to work due to a disability or long term illness. 60% of pupils at Frobisher Primary School, on the edge of the village, receive free school meals.|$|E

5|$|The {{land was}} {{originally}} {{a combination of}} fields and salt marshes, and was generally unsuitable for agricultural use. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to provide low cost, affordable <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> for working-class families, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the Second World War, a shortage of housing meant the properties gradually became permanently inhabited, despite not being designed for regular use. The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|There is a shop/post office {{located in}} Inverarish. Accommodation is {{available}} in the old manor of Raasay House, and at various B. There are significant numbers of incomers and <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> especially in the south of the island. This has helped to arrest the population decline from over 900 in 1803 to 194 in 2001. Some inhabitants belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays there are no public services, the playground is closed and, until 2004, the ferry did not run.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered <b>holiday</b> <b>homes</b> occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
