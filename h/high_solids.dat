25|$|<b>High</b> <b>solids</b> (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, <b>high</b> <b>solids</b> (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E

25|$|Low solids (wet) digesters can {{transport}} material {{through the}} system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than <b>high</b> <b>solids</b> due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered <b>high</b> <b>solids</b> content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, <b>high</b> <b>solids</b> lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E

To determine the best parameters to achieve maximum mechanical properties in thixoforging of 7075 aluminum alloy, we need to consider the impact of some parameters such as tool temperature, shear rate. For this, we use extrusion tests with constant speed [1] where these parameters are known. The result of this study is that each parameter has its level of impact on the thixoforging: the temperature of the tool and the deformation rate shouldn't be high to avoid cracks. Thermal exchanges between the material flow and the tool have to be reduced to avoid high solidification rate [2]. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Enzymatic {{wheat gluten}} {{hydrolysis}} at <b>high</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations is advantageous from an {{environmental and economic}} point of view. However, increased wheat gluten concentrations result in a concentration effect with a decreased hydrolysis rate at constant enzyme-to-substrate ratios and a decreased maximum attainable degree of hydrolysis (DH%). We here identified the underlying factors causing the concentration effect. Wheat gluten was hydrolyzed at solid concentrations from 4. 4 % to 70 %. The decreased hydrolysis rate was present at all solid concentrations and {{at any time of}} the reaction. Mass transfer limitations, enzyme inhibition and water activity were shown to not cause this hydrolysis rate limitation up to 50 % solids. However, the hydrolysis rate limitation can be, at least partly, explained by a second-order enzyme inactivation process. Furthermore, mass transfer impeded the hydrolysis above 60 % solids. Addition of enzyme after 24 h at <b>high</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations scarcely increased the DH%, suggesting that the maximum attainable DH% decreases at <b>high</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations.
