25|$|Also in 1966, Ivan Sutherland {{continued}} to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HMD).</b> Called the Sword of Damocles {{because of the}} hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah - a development which would turn that department {{into one of the}} most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.|$|E

A <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> is a small display that places the screen {{directly in front of}} the eyes.

For image generation, Pico-projectors is used instead of LCD or OLED screen.|$|R
40|$|<b>Head-mounted</b> <b>displays</b> for virtual environments {{facilitate}} an {{immersive experience}} that seems {{more real than}} an experience provided by a desk-top monitor [18]; however, the cost of <b>head-mounted</b> <b>displays</b> can prohibit their use. An empirical study was conducted investigating differences in spatial knowledge learned for a virtual environment presented in three viewing conditions: <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display,</b> large projection screen, and desk-top monitor. Participants in each condition were asked to reproduce their cognitive map of a virtual environment, which had been developed during individual exploration of the environment along a predetermined course. Error scores were calculated, indicating {{the degree to which}} each participant's map differed from the actual layout of the virtual environment. No statistically significant difference was found between the <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> and large projection screen conditions. An implication of this result is that a large projection screen may be an effective, inexpensive substitute for a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display...</b>|$|R

Modern HMDs often employ sensors for {{six degrees of freedom}} monitoring that allow the system to align virtual information to the physical world and adjust accordingly with the user's head movements. HMDs can provide VR users mobile and collaborative experiences. Specific providers, such as uSens and Gestigon, are even including gesture controls for full virtual immersion.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies from}} {{different}} research groups investigating perception of absolute, egocentric distances in virtual environments have reported a compression of the intended {{size of the}} virtual space.

We manipulate stereo viewing conditions in a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> and show the effects of using both measured and fixed interpupilary distances, as well as bi-ocular and monocular viewing of graphics, on absolute distance judgments.

50|$|For {{displaying}} {{information gathered}} {{from a range}} of sensors across the aircraft, the cockpit features a wide-angle holographic head-up display (HUD) system, two head-down flat-panel colour multi-function displays (MFDs) as well as a central collimated display. These displays have been strategically placed to minimise pilot distraction from the external environment. Some displays feature a touch interface for ease of Human-computer interaction (HCI). A <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HMD)</b> remains to be integrated {{to take full advantage of}} its MICA missiles. The cockpit is fully compatible with night vision goggles (NVG).|$|E
50|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} facet in making a virtual environment seem real is an appeal to sight. A virtual reality headset, incorporating a <b>head-mounted</b> <b>display</b> (<b>HMD)</b> is {{placed in front of}} the eyes of a patient like a pair of sunglasses, enabling for complete visual attention. A virtual environment is then displayed. A system of motion sensors tracks movement of the patient's head.

It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling.
