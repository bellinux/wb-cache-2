Kirk (writing in 1878) states that--"in Auckland, where a <b>dense</b> <b>sward</b> {{of grass}} is soon formed, single {{specimens}} of the European milk Thistle (Carduus marianus) {{have been known}} for the past fifteen years; but although they seeded freely, the seeds had no opportunity of germinating, so that the thistle did not spread. A remarkable exception to this rule occurred during {{the formation of the}} Onehunga railway, where a few seeds fell on disturbed soil, grew up and flowered. The railway works being suspended, the plant increased rapidly, and spread wherever it could find disturbed soil." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{highest and}} sandiest portion next the Atlantic was thinly covered with Beach-grass and Indigo-weed. Next {{to this the}} surface of the upland {{generally}} consisted of white sand and gravel, like coarse salt, through which a scanty vegetation found its way up. It will give an ornithologist some idea of its barrenness if I mention that the next June, the month of grass. I found a night-hawk's eggs there, and that almost any square rod thereabouts, taken at random, would be an eligible site for such a deposit. The kildeer-plover, which loves a similar locality, also drops its eggs there, and fills the air above with its din. This upland also produced Cladonia lichens, poverty-grass, savory-leaved aster (Diplopappus linariifolius), mouse-ear, bear-berry, &c. On a few hillsides the savory-leaved aster and mouse-ear alone made quite a <b>dense</b> <b>sward,</b> said to be very pretty when the aster is in bloom. In some parts the two species of poverty-grass (Hudsonia tomentosa and ericoides), which deserve a better name, reign for miles in little hemispherical tufts or islets, like moss, scattered over the waste. They linger in bloom there till the middle of July. Occasionally near the beach these rounded beds, as also those of the sea-sandwort (Honkenya peploides), were filled with sand within an inch of their tops, and were hard, like large ant-hills, while the surrounding sand was soft. In summer, if the poverty-grass grows {{at the head of a}} Hollow looking toward the sea, in a bleak position where the wind rushes up, the northern or exposed half of the tuft is sometimes all black and dead like an oven-broom, while the opposite half is yellow with blossoms, the whole hillside thus presenting a remarkable contrast when seen from the poverty-stricken and the flourishing side. This plant, which in many places would be esteemed an ornament, is here despised by many on account of its being associated with barrenness. It might well be adopted for the Barnstable coat-of-arms, in a field sableux. I should be proud of it. Here and there were tracts of Beach-grass mingled with the Sea-side Goldenrod and Beach-pea, which reminded us still more forcibly of the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Lake Hula and its {{neighbouring}} peatland in {{the upper}} Galilee, Israel were drained during the 1950 s. For about 40 years after drainage most of the area was under continuous intensive cultivation with rain-fed winter crops and irrigated summer crops. In 1994 an area of about 110 ha of mainly peat soil was re-flooded and 350 ha surrounding it were partly taken out of intensive agricultural use. The surrounding area was still cultivated under rain-fed conditions in the cool winter season, but left fallow during the hot, dry summer. The summer vegetation was mowed periodically to promote {{the development of a}} continuous sward cover for recreation and control of wind erosion. The goal of this research was to study the relationship between dynamic changes in the soil and water conditions and the composition and species distribution of the spontaneous summer vegetation. During four consecutive years the vegetation dynamics were characterised by increasing dominance of Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. Cyperus rotundus, which was common under irrigated cultivation, partly disappeared under the new non-irrigated regime. The density and growth rate of the vegetation mainly reflected differences in the water table depth, which varied between 0. 5 m and 3 m. Three years after re-flooding, soil salinity was high in areas where the water table was higher than 0. 5 m and in dry patches where almost no cover of vegetation was found. In these sites the concentration of mineral nitrogen (N-NO 3 and/or N-NH 4) was especially high. A continuous vegetation cover developed on the peat soil in areas where the depth of the water table was between 1 m and 2 m. Mowing the vegetation periodically in summer suppressed the growth of tall, weedy species and promoted the dominance of Cynodon dactylon creating a <b>dense,</b> productive <b>sward...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} Nardus stricta {{dominated}} subalpine grassland (Nardo-Caricion rigidae alliance) is a frequently discussed {{topic in the}} Giant Mountains (Karkonosze in the Czech Republic). Many researchers considered them, as secondary stands arisen after Pinus mugo removal and by consequent oligotrophization of original plant communities, caused by long-term rough grazing and hay making activities without manuring. On the contrary, they are recognized as natural due to inability of generative reproduction of N. stricta and the very slow vegetative spread there. The {{aim of this study}} was to find proofs for generative reproduction of mat grass in subalpine conditions of the Giant Mountains. We identified a Pinus mugo nursery with arable land abandoned in 1956 and compared its vegetation with that of the surrounding area. <b>Dense</b> and homogenous <b>sward</b> dominated by N. stricta developed during the succession on the old arable land for 48 years, and it is an indisputable proof of generative reproduction of N. stricta there. Synthesizing historical facts on human activities in the past and the results of our contemporary vegetation analysis, we conclude that the Nardo-Caricion rigidae grassland was capable to spread relatively quickly, when agricultural activities above the upper timber line were introduced...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} two men {{had taken}} their stations, and began to look about them, a feeling of awe mingled with their curiosity. Truly, the scene was one so very {{remarkable}} and imposing that it might have filled more intellectual and better fortified minds with some such sensation. The fire was by no means large, nor was it particularly bright; but sufficient to cast a dim light on the objects within reach of its rays. It was in the precise centre of a bit of bottom land of about half an acre in extent, which was so formed and surrounded, as to have something of the appearance of the arena of a large amphitheatre. There was one break in the encircling rise of ground, it is true, and that was at a spot directly opposite the station of le Bourdon and his companion, where the rill which flowed from the spring found a passage out toward the more open ground.

40|$|White clover (Trifolium repens L.) florets {{have the}} {{capacity}} to produce up to 6 seeds, yet normally the average number of seeds per floret is somewhere between 2 and 3. 5. The cause of this low seed set is not known, but such an understanding is necessary as a basis for the development of improved management practices for seed production. Low light intensity has been implicated in the reduction of seed number per flower head and even in the abortion of developing flower heads. Therefore the present study examined the influence of light intensity on inflorescence development and seed yield of "Grasslands Huia" and "Grasslands Pitau" white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Investigations were also carried out {{to examine the effects of}} light intensity on sink strength of young flower heads with a view to understanding the mode of action of light. Under controlled environmental conditions when plants were grown at a range of light intensities from 2000 to 10000 lux, the ovary length, number of florets per inflorescence, the size of the ovules within the carpel, percentage of fertile ovules and percentage of ovules setting seed in the plants grown at the lowest intensity were decreased by 18, 53, 13, 75 % respectively compared with controls grown at the highest intensity. A stain-clearing technique was used to examine the cytoplasmic state of embryo sacs in intact, unfertilized, mature ovules. Ovules with fully formed embryo sacs containing a full complement of nuclei were classed as fertile ovule. Ovules with shrunken embryo sacs which lacked a full complement of nuclei were classed as sterile. Light intensity had no significant effect on ovule number. However, in the field, the young flower heads experience very low light levels due to shading by foliage canopy only when they are young. Within the canopy light intensities may be as low as 1 % of full light even at midday when incoming radiation is most intense. To simulate field conditions in the glasshouse the inflorescences were shaded on otherwise fully lit plants by using either neutral shade or simulated shade light at wavelengths similar to those of light filtered through a leaf canopy. Low light had a slight effect on pollen fertility, the effect being significant only at some stages of inflorescence development. These stages of inflorescence development were synchronized with the development of pollen mother cells into pollen grain. Irrespective of the stage of inflorescence development, shading the inflorescence alone decreased the length of the ovary. The most striking observation was that even in good growing conditions only 70 % of ovules formed in a flower head had fertile embryo sacs capable of setting seeds. The reduction in seed number per head was brought about by an increase in the number of florets aborting, and by a decrease in the percentage of ovules setting seeds. The close correlation between the percentage of apparently fertile ovules and the percentage of ovules setting seeds strongly suggests that this reduction was largely brought about by an increase in ovule sterility. The degree of ovule sterility was greatest when shade was applied to the inflorescence at the eighth node below the apex on a stolon. Shade treatments might have interfered with meiosis (formation of megaspores). To examine the significance of these observations for seed production practices, field experiments were set up to determine to what extent and under what growing conditions flower head development and seed yield per head were influenced by canopy density and simulated overcast weather conditions in plants of "Grasslands Huia" and also "Grasslands Pitau". Field studies showed that flower heads developed in a dense canopy produced 37 - 39 % fewer seeds per head than those formed in an open canopy. Some of this reduction was brought about by an increase in the number of florets aborting, but much of it was caused by a higher proportion of sterile ovules in dense canopies than in open canopies. Simulation of overcast weather by artificial shading also strongly affected the seed yield per flower head. When plants were shaded before pollination only, there was a 24 - 31 % reduction in seed number per head; when shade was applied only after pollination there was a reduction of 25 - 28 %. Therefore overcast weather conditions during early stages of inflorescence development or during the seed maturation period could lead to reduction in seed number per head. In the past, low seed number per flower head has been attributed to poor pollination. The results obtained in the present investigation showed that a high percentage of pollinated carpels contained sufficient pollen tubes for the fertilization of all ovules. The observation of a random seed set pattern and a positive correlation between the ovule fertility and the ovules setting seed also strongly suggest that pollination was probably not the limiting factor. Rather, the limiting factor appeared to be the degree of sterility of unfertilized ovules. These results showed that there was a direct effect of light intensity on flower head development. Therefore investigations were carried out to study the influence of shade on the growth and sink activity of young flower heads and peduncles. Measurement of the peduncle elongation rate by using a linear voltage displacement transducer showed that when the inflorescence alone was shaded, peduncle elongation was higher than in the light. Translocation studies using a 11 C-labelling technique showed that shading the inflorescence alone had little effect on translocation of assimilates into the inflorescence, but induced a major change in partitioning of assimilates within it. Peduncle elongation induced by shade was accompanied by an increase in partitioning of photoassimilates to the peduncle, at the expense of the flower head. The results of this study suggest that one of the major advantages of the practice of defoliation at the time of closing the paddock for seed production is probably the enhancement of ovule fertility; and that decreased seed yield in duller, wetter summers is probably, at least in part, attributable to increased ovule sterility in the dense canopies formed under those conditions. Form this point of view, for best seed production an optimal management strategy would be to grow the crop as spaced plants with an open canopy rather than a <b>denser</b> <b>sward</b> with a closed canopy...|$|R
40|$|Reindeer {{can have}} strong {{effects on the}} plant species {{composition}} and functioning of tundra ecosystems, and often promote a transition towards a graminoid-dominated vegetation type. As a result, they influence many ecological processes, such as nutrient dynamics, soil biotic composition and functioning, and carbon storage. Several {{studies suggest that the}} effect of reindeer on vegetation may follow predictable patterns and could induce an alternative stable vegetation state. However, little empirical data on the long-term stability of reindeer effects on vegetation exist, as it is inherently challenging to study these ecological processes experimentally on a sufficiently long timescale. The main objective of this thesis was therefore {{to gain a better understanding}} of the long-term ecological processes following reindeer-induced vegetation shifts. In order to gain a more mechanistic insight in what initially drives this transition, I used a field-based grazing simulation experiment in which I separated defoliation, trampling, moss removal and the addition of feces. This allowed me to test the relative contribution of reindeer-related activities to initiating the shift from moss and heath- dominated tundra towards a graminoid-dominated vegetation state. Additionally, I studied the long-term ecological stability following such a vegetation shift. I did this by addressing historical milking grounds (HMGs) : sites where high reindeer concentrations associated with historical traditional reindeer herding practices induced a vegetation transition from shrubs towards graminoids several centuries earlier, but which were abandoned a century ago. Studying HMGs allowed me to address: 1. The potential stability of reindeer-induced vegetation shifts; 2. The ecological mechanisms contributing to the long-term stability of these vegetation shifts; and 3. How such long-lasting vegetation changes influence soil carbon- and nutrient cycling. I found that trampling by reindeer is an important mechanism by which reindeer cause vegetation change. Addressing HMGs further revealed that this vegetation change can be hightly persistent, as the studied HMGs showed only a low encroachment at the surrounding borders in the last 50 years. The vegetation in the core areas of all studied HMGs had remained strikingly stable, and were hardly invaded by surrounding shrubs. Interestingly, soil nutrient concentrations and microbial activities were still different from the surrounding area as well, and even comparable to actively grazed areas. Even after many centuries of changed vegetation composition and soil processes, there was no difference in total carbon sequestration. This suggests that the environmental conditions for microbial decomposition were more important than vegetation composition for the soil carbon stocks, in our study site. After studying the contemporary habitat use of HMGs by reindeer and other herbivores, investigating the potential plant-soil feedbacks mechanisms and detailed soil analyses, I concluded that several ecological mechanisms contribute to the long-term stability of HMGs: first, the altered soil biotic and abiotic conditions appear to have a stronger advantage for HMG vegetation than for the surrounding tundra vegetation. Furthermore, I found a clear browsing preference of small rodents on single shrubs proliferating in HMGs, causing a strong limitation on shrub expansion. Moreover, the <b>dense</b> established <b>sward</b> of graminoids likely poses a strong direct competition for space and nutrients, hindering seedling establishment. Finally, I conclude that HMGs are highly stable on relevant ecological timescales, and propose how the concepts of historical contingency and ASS can be applied to understand stability of these reindeer-induced vegetation transitions...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} soil characteristics, the cutting frequency, i.e. the usual number of cuts per year, was {{significantly}} lower at the high risk than at the low risk sites. A higher cutting frequency is usually associated with higher amounts of applied manure, as also supported by our data (r[*]=[*] 0.505, p[*]=[*] 0.023). Both management measures promote dense swards which might be unattractive for oviposition and might be more resilient to grub feeding than weak swards (Pötsch et al. 1997, Bocksch 2003). Additionally, a <b>dense</b> <b>sward</b> hinders the warming of the soil by sun radiation and therefore reduces soil temperature.

40|$|One of {{the most}} natural and {{ecological}} ways of reversibility, setting arable land aside, is estab-lishing a temporary grass stand with a special management and biomass utilisation (Firbank et al. 2003). The influence {{of the way of}} the setting, the land aside on the following crops, its means on their nutrition and weed control requirements, is often researched. Pure stands of legumes are important as good forecrops especially in the agricultural systems with limited inputs, but they have a very low coverage in winter. Grass stands have a be�er coverage but nitrogen fertilisation is necessary when they are des-tined for more years of growing to maintain complete and <b>dense</b> <b>sward.</b> Temporary grass-legume mixtures with different species and components shared can be a good solution (Svobodová et al. 2001). The utilisation of the produced biomass is the other problem. If it is not used for example as a source of energy, it is necessary to leave it on the field surface, best cut up as a mulch, that is for a source of nutrients and organic matter for the soil microflora, microfauna and plants. The influence of mulching on yields and botanical composition of temporary grass monoculture stands was researched on the arable land by Šantrůček et al.

We tested various treatments to reintroduce common perennial plant species (Brachypodium retusum, Poaceae, and Thymus vulgaris, Lamiaceae), which are usually not or poorly reintroduced via soil and hay transfer. Treatments included microenvironmental manipulations (rock cover and plant interactions) and two grazing intensities. Target perennial species were transplanted in 2002 in the reference grassland ecosystem (intact grassland area used as a control) and in two abandoned fields. Survival was assessed in June 2003 and June 2004. Target species shoot and root biomass were measured in June 2004. Grazing greatly reduced the survival and biomass of both target species and its effects were reinforced by summer drought: plants that did not establish well enough during the autumn and spring did not survive summer. The restored rock cover had a mild positive effect, particularly on B. retusum. There were no negative or positive plant neighbor interactions in the steppe, while there was competition in both abandoned fields. Competition was particularly intense in the abandoned melon field, composed of a <b>dense</b> <b>sward</b> of annual grasses (Bromus sp.). In order to reintroduce perennial species to dry grasslands, the ideal combination of treatments is to exclude or reduce grazing {{during the first year}} to allow seedlings to establish and to recreate adequate microenvironmental conditions.

30|$|Zweigelt 1928 (quoted by Scheerpelz 1950) {{described}} climatic {{and soil}} conditions as main factors responsible for high densities of Melolontha ssp. grubs. Similarly, population fluctuations of P. horticola {{can be attributed}} to climatic factors (Milne 1964 and 1984). Laznik et al. (2012) stated that grubs are most common in sandy or sandy loam soils, but can also occur in clay soils. According to Scheerpelz (1950), Pötsch et al. (1997) and Albert and Fröschle (2010), for oviposition, M. melolontha prefers dry, loose soils and sunny meadows, particularly with a slightly gappy sward and a high temperature radiation which might direct the female beetles to suitable locations. Furthermore, for the optimal development of the larvae warm, dry, moderately permeable, deep and eutrophic soils are needed (Scheerpelz 1950). In contrast, Faber (1951 a) stated that the locations with not too high, but closed vegetation are selected for oviposition. Similarly to M. melolontha, P. horticola prefers dry and sunny habitats with sandy soils and slightly gappy swards, while dense swards with high vegetation inhibits the egg deposition of the females (Milne 1964, Bocksch 2003). In British grassland sites, Raw (1951) observed a preference of P. horticola adults for dense, unscythed vegetation, but reports that more grubs of the species could be found in dry friable than in moist soils. Apart from a possible effect on egg deposition, a dense, well supplied sward reduces soil warming and might endure grub feeding to the roots much better than weak grass plants. Accordingly, management measures that support a <b>dense</b> <b>sward,</b> like a balanced cutting, grazing and manuring regime, are considered {{to reduce the risk of}} grub damage (Pötsch et al. 1997).|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{management}} {{has resulted in}} a loss of plant diversity in European floodplain grasslands. In particular, species adapted to traditional land use have largely declined or disappeared. Restoration approaches based on the conversion to traditional management systems often fail to re-establish these characteristic floodplain species (target species). We tested dispersal and microsite limitations in three studies on grassland restoration and succession in east German river valleys. In a long-term transect study, the migration of target species from source communities (reference grassland) into restoration grassland was analyzed over a period of ten years that began nine years after conversion to traditional management. A transplant experiment was set up to examine dispersal distances and vectors. Microsite limitation was tested by comparing seedling emergence in three soil disturbance treatments (deep tillage, shallow tillage, and control). The transect analysis revealed a slow migration of target species into restoration sites, reaching approximately 30 to 45 m within 19 years of restoration. Similarity indices between restoration grasslands and adjacent reference communities did not significantly increase during the ten years of observation. In the transplant study, seedlings were concentrated close to the mother plants, and dispersal distances did not exceed 3 to 4 m. The strong dispersal limitation was confirmed by an analysis of seedling survival showing no differences between restoration and reference grasslands. In the undisturbed control plots, seedling emergence following seed addition by hay transfer or hand sowing was lower than 0. 03 %. The soil disturbance treatments significantly increased recruitment, and the highest seedling numbers were observed in the deep tillage treatment, indicating microsite limitation. The results suggest that the <b>dense</b> <b>sward</b> of floodplain grasslands represents a second strong environmental filter hampering grassland succession.

40|$|Halting {{the loss}} of {{grassland}} biodiversity and restoring degraded ecosystems are high priority tasks in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures is widely used in grassland resto-ration because of its high predictability and fast, promising results. Generally, the sown perennial grass-es establish {{within a few years}} and form a <b>dense</b> <b>sward,</b> which effectively suppresses weeds. Unfortu-nately, these grasslands are often species-poor because the sown grasses hamper the colonisation of target grassland forbs. Our aim was to test a novel approach to increase the diversity of species-poor grasslands. We selected eight 8 -year-old grasslands restored by low-diversity seed sowing where we created 32 establishment gaps by breaking up the grass sward and sowing a high-diversity seed mixture (35 native species). Altogether, we established three grazed gaps (1 m × 1 m, 2 m × 2 m and 4 m × 4 m) and one fenced gap (4 m × 4 m) per site and monitored the presence and abundance of sown and non-sown species within a time frame of two years. We asked the following questions: (1) Which target species establish most successfully? (2) What is the effect of establishment gap size on the establish-ment success of target species and weeds? (3) What is the effect of management (grazed versus not managed) on the species composition of the establishment gaps? Our results showed that by creating establishment gaps and sowing diverse seed mixtures, we were able to overcome microsite and propa-gule limitation, successfully introducing target species into the species-poor grasslands. We found that all sown species established in the gaps, and the majority of the species maintained or even increased their first-year cover in the second year. Smaller gaps were characterised by lower cover of sown spe-cies and a quite stochastic development compared to the larger ones. Weed cover was moderate in the first year and decreased significantly in the second year, regardless of gap size. Therefore, in restoration practice, the use of larger establishment gaps is recommended. We found that the cover of sown species and weeds were similar in the grazed and unmanaged gaps during our study. However, management by extensive grazing might be crucial in the long-term because livestock can disperse target species propagules and create microsites. Our study shows that establishment gaps can serve as biodiversity hotspots. Further studies need to clarify to what extent they can improve the restoration success across the entire grassland...|$|E
