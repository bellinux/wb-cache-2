5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
500|$|By {{the final}} week of the campaign, McGovern <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lose. While he was {{appearing}} in Battle Creek, Michigan, on November 2, a Nixon admirer heckled him. McGovern told the heckler, [...] "I've got a secret for you," [...] then said softly into his ear, [...] "Kiss my ass." [...] The incident was overheard and reported in the press, and {{became part of the}} tale of the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times {{rated the}} episode the 79th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale), {{described}} the episode as [...] "thrilling," [...] but opined {{that the show}} since [...] "has done similar things much better." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating [...] "even though I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{go back to the}} CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying. This is how you identify good TV: When you know what's going to happen and you still get swept up in it all." ...|$|E

500|$|Joel {{made his}} first {{television}} appearance {{in the wake of}} the release of Piano Man, on the syndicated Don Kirshner's Rock Concert program, in a performance recorded live in Chicago in March 1974. [...] "Captain Jack" [...] was one of the three songs that were broadcast. In keeping with U.S. broadcast television standards of the time, Joel was forced to alter the lyrics slightly. Instead of singing the line [...] "You just sit at home and masturbate", he sang, [...] "You just sit at home and la la la". Kirshner recalled, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a big star, and so did he." ...|$|E
500|$|Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup {{and said}} in his {{autobiography}} that, on returning to the dressing room {{at the end of}} the match, he [...] "felt tired from all the years". His mind was made up and he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. I know people will be watching The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E
500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, you <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 1994, while {{returning}} to his cell from the medical unit, Ferguson was attacked in jail {{by a group of}} inmates. Ferguson suffered a broken nose and a swollen left eye. Prison officials had been notified by Kuby that an assault was imminent, and {{were in the process of}} following up on the warning when Ferguson was attacked. Kuby, who said he had been warned of the attack by another inmate, stated [...] "The word was out. Everyone in the institution <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be set up." [...] Kuby called the attack racially motivated, and later alleged some jail officials and guards had advance knowledge of the impending assault. Five inmates were charged with second-degree assault for their connection in the attack.|$|E

5000|$|At another fête, Marcel Proust {{asked her}} what makeup a duchess might wear. She summarily {{dismissed}} him because [...] "he smelt of mothballs." [...] Rubinstein recollected later, [...] "How <b>was</b> I to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> famous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy laughed. [...] "If I had <b>known</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{tell that}} tale, I almost fancy I should have left him where he was; but, after all, I {{scarcely}} think he did. Seas of the kind mentioned could exist only in a newspaperman's imagination." ...|$|R
2500|$|Civil rights figures came {{to believe}} that Ali had an {{energizing}} effect on the freedom movement as a whole. Al Sharpton spoke of his bravery {{at a time when there}} was still widespread support for the Vietnam War. [...] "For the heavyweight champion of the world, who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the line—the money, the ability to get endorsements—to sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail and did it anyway. That's another level of leadership and sacrifice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wells, who {{was acting}} as a scout {{in advance of the}} party, knew the Indians would attack and had painted his face black: [...] a sign of bravery, a sign to the Pottawattomi that he knew their intentions, and as a sign that he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. [...] As the {{evacuated}} garrison walked down the beach, Wells rode in advance {{to keep an eye on}} the Pottawattomi, and he was one of the first to go down when they attacked. [...] The [...] "battle" [...] took place in the dunes along Lake Michigan about a mile south of the Chicago River, in what is now downtown Chicago. [...] Wells was shot and killed by the Potowatamis, who decapitated him and ate his heart. His opponents, although considering him a traitor to their cause, nonetheless sought to gain some of his courage by consuming his heart.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick shot {{ahead of}} Jeff Gordon {{on the final}} restart with two laps {{remaining}} to win the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. “Oh, we came here and tested thinking {{that this was going}} to be the hardest round to get through because of Talladega,” Harvick said. “There’s so much that you can’t control there. We wanted to try to control the things that we could control. We felt like Kansas and here (Charlotte) were playing to our strengths; and just see where it fell after that once we get to the next round. So I’m really proud of everybody at SHR. I’m really proud of all my guys on this team. I just can’t thank everybody enough.” [...] "I'm really proud of that finish, really proud of that effort," [...] Gordon said. [...] " ...

2500|$|Benjamin <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be killed. According to Rachel Plummer's account, Benjamin {{returned}} to the fort, after his first talk with the war party, and told his brother and father that he believed {{they would all be}} killed, and that they should run swiftly to the woods. Silas again argued with him, telling him they should push the big gate shut, and man the walls. Ben pointed out, rightly, Rachel said, that there was no time, and their [...] "course was decided." [...] He told her, [...] "run little Rachel, for your life and your unborn child, run now and fast!" [...] She said he then straightened up and went back outside. She recounted how Silas told her to watch the front gate, after Benjamin had gone out to talk to the Indians the second time, when she herself wanted to flee, while he ran for his musket and powder pouch. “They will kill Benjamin,” she reported her Uncle Silas saying, “and then me, but I will do for at least one of them, by God.” At that moment, she said she heard whooping outside the fort, and then Indians were inside.|$|E
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Hill looked up to players like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird while dreaming of one day playing in the NBA; {{when asked about his}} goal of {{becoming}} a first-round pick in the 2008 NBA draft, Hill commented: [...] "It's my childhood dream". An only child, Hill attended Broad Ripple High School where he excelled {{as one of the top}} high school players in the state and formed part of the 'Magnificent Seven' from Indianapolis (Greg Oden, Mike Conley, Jr., Josh McRoberts, Rodney Carney, Eric Gordon, & Courtney Lee). Carney remembers playing against Hill : [...] "This little kid comes in hitting all kinds of 3s, and I was like, 'Who is this little dude?...I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be something when I saw this little skinny kid handling the ball and shooting like that." [...] Hill played against every member of the 'Magnificent Seven' except for Gordon who was recovering from a broken wrist during their meetup. He faced off against Oden and Conley during his Junior year in High School, and remembers playing pickup-games against 10-year-old Gordon when he was 13.|$|E
