2500|$|The {{orbital motion}} of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it [...] "the best studied natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System" [...] {{in terms of}} orbits completed. [...] Its close orbit around Mars produces some unusual effects. With an altitude of , Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbit,</b> it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky. Phobos's phases, inasmuch as they can be observed from Mars, take 0.3191 days (Phobos's synodic period) to run their course, a mere 13 seconds longer than Phobos's sidereal period.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} off-equatorial orbits in razor-thin disks {{is still in}} its beginnings. Contrary to what was {{presented}} in the literature in recent publications, the vertical stability criterion for <b>equatorial</b> circular <b>orbits</b> cannot be based on the vertical epicyclic frequency, because of the discontinuity in the gravitational field on the equatorial plane. We present a rigorous criterion for the vertical stability of circular orbits in systems composed by a razor-thin disk surrounded by a smooth axially symmetric distribution of matter, the latter representing additional structures such as thick disk, bulge and (dark matter) halo. This criterion is satisfied once the mass surface density of the thin disk is positive. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> are presented. In particular, the analysis of nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> allows us to construct an approximate analytical third integral of motion in this region of phase-space, which describes the shape of these orbits in the meridional plane.

50|$|To an {{observer}} on the earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed {{position in the}} sky. This is because it revolves around the earth at the earth's own angular velocity (360 degrees every 24 hours, in an <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbit).</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{analytical}} formula for an approximated third integral of motion associated with nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> in the Galaxy: I- 3 = Z Sigma(1 / 3) (I) I, where Z(R) is the vertical amplitude of the orbit at galactocentric distance R and Sigma(I) (R) is the integrated dynamical surface mass {{density of the}} disk, a quantity which has recently become measurable. We also suggest that this relation is valid for disk-crossing orbits {{in a wide variety}} of axially symmetric galactic models, which range from razor-thin disks to disks with non-negligible thickness, whether or not the system includes bulges and halos. We apply our formalism to a Miyamoto-Nagai model and to a realistic model for the Milky Way. In both cases, the results provide fits for the shape of nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> which are better than the corresponding curves obtained by the usual adiabatic approximation when the orbits have vertical amplitudes comparable to the disk's scale height. We also discuss the role of this approximate third integral of motion in modified theories of gravity...|$|R
40|$|The current {{paper offers}} a {{comprehensive}} dynamical analysis and Fourier series approximations of J 2 -bounded <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits.</b> The initial conditions of heterogeneous families of J 2 -perturbed <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> are determined first. Then {{the characteristics of}} two types of J 2 -bounded orbits, namely, pseudo-elliptic orbit and critical circular orbit, are studied. Due to the ambiguity of the closed-form solutions which comprise the elliptic integrals and Jacobian elliptic functions, showing little physical insight into the problem, a new scheme, termed Fourier series expansion, is adopted for approximation herein. Based on least-squares fitting to the coefficients, the solutions are expressed with arbitrary high-order Fourier series, since the radius and the flight time vary periodically {{as a function of}} the polar angle. As a consequence, the solutions can be written in terms of elementary functions such as cosines, rather than complex mathematical functions. Simulations enhance the proposed approximation method, showing bounded and negligible deviations. The approximation results show a promising prospect in preliminary orbits design, determination, and transfers for low-altitude spacecrafts...|$|R

40|$|Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) [...] {{binaries}} {{in which}} a stellar-mass object spirals into a massive black hole or other massive, compact body [...] are important sources of gravitational waves for LISA and LIGO, respectively. Thorne has speculated that the waves from EMRIs and IMRIs encode, in principle, {{all the details of}} (i) the central body's spacetime geometry (metric), (ii) the tidal coupling (energy and angular momentum exchange) between the central body and orbiting object, and (iii) the evolving orbital elements. Fintan Ryan has given a first partial proof that this speculation is correct: Restricting himself to nearly circular, nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits</b> and ignoring tidal coupling, Ryan proved that the central body's metric is encoded in the waves. In this paper we generalize Ryan's theorem. Retaining Ryan's restriction to nearly circular and nearly <b>equatorial</b> <b>orbits,</b> and dropping the assumption of no tidal coupling, we prove that Thorne's conjecture is nearly fully correct: the waves encode not only the central body's metric but also the evolving orbital elements and (in a sense slightly different from Thorne's conjecture) the evolving tidal coupling.
