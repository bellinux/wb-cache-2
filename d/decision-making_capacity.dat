These different categories of subjects {{are protected by}} multiple federal regulations.

Two papers [49, 74] discussed the “big data exclusions” referring to those individuals “whose {{information is not}} regularly collected or analyzed {{because they do not}} routinely engage in data-generating practices” [49]. On the same note, Bakken and Reame [6] argued that data is mainly gathered from white, educated people leaving out racial minorities such as Latinos. Boyd and Crawford discussed the creation of new digital divides, arguing that discrimination may arise due to (1) differences in information access and processing skills—the Big Data rich and the Big Data poor, and due to (2) gender differences insofar most researchers with computational skills are men [12]. Lastly, Cohen et al.

The MOLST Program is an {{initiative}} to facilitate end-of-life medical decision-making in New York State, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Ohio and Maryland, that involves use of the MOLST form. Most other U.S. states have similar initiatives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. In New York state, the MOLST form is a New York State Department of Health form (DOH-5003). MOLST is for patients such as a terminally ill patient, whether or not treatment is provided. [...] For this example, assume the patient retains medical <b>decision-making</b> <b>capacity</b> and wants to die naturally in a residential setting, not in the intensive-care unit of a hospital on a ventilator with a feeding tube.

40|$|Impaired {{decision-making}} is a core {{problem in}} several psychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, mania, drug addiction, eating disorders, {{and substance abuse}} {{as well as in}} chronic pain.

Many human studies aimed at measuring <b>decision-making</b> <b>capacities</b> use the Iowa Gambling Task, a task designed to model every-day life choices through a conflict between immediate gratification and long-term outcomes. Recently, new rodent models based on the same principle have been developed to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying IGT-like decision-making on behavioral, neural and pharmacological levels. The comparative strengths, as well as the similarities and differences between these paradigms are discussed.

30|$|Current {{systems that}} are {{commonly}} described as ‘smart learning environments’ tend {{to take one of}} two general forms. The first, that I characterize as a centralized model, imbues the environment with an active role in both adapting to and shaping the behaviour of its inhabitants (e.g. (Spector, 2014; Hwang, 2014)). Examples such as intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive hypermedia, and some forms of learning analytics system learn from the behaviours of their users, combined with algorithmic <b>decision-making</b> <b>capacities,</b> in order to shape themselves and the learning experiences of their inhabitants. Most are context-aware, and either adapt to or are designed to work in specific contexts. They may be fully digital, or blend the digital with the physical, and the degree of digital intelligence may vary from simple rule-based systems to deep learning approaches. Often, they make use of mixed reality, or augmented reality technologies that overlay or annotate the physical environment. An archetypal example might be an agent that guides a student around an environment, adapting to their perceived learning and intentions as they proceed (e.g. (Gwo-Jen et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011)).|$|R
50|$|According to {{comprehensive}} {{research data}} compiled by economist Andrzej Karpiński and others, 25-30% of the reductions were economically justified, {{while the rest}} resulted from various processes that were controversial, often erroneous or pathological, including actions aimed at quick self-enrichment {{on the part of}} people with <b>decision-making</b> <b>capacities.</b> Unlike {{in the case of the}} Western deindustrialisation of the preceding years, in Poland modern competitive industries with established markets were also eliminated, including the electronic, telecommunications, computer, industrial machinery, armament and chemical industries. The abandoned domestic and foreign markets, often in Eastern Europe and the Third World countries, had subsequently been taken over by non-Polish interests. Nearly half (47%) of the lost enterprises represented consumer product light industry, rather than heavy industry. Capitalist Poland's early economic policies resulted in economic and social crises including high unemployment, and in what some see as irredeemable losses, impacting Poland's situation today. At the same time however, many constructive developments took place, including the widespread rise of entrepreneurship, and, especially after Poland joined the European Union, significant economic growth. The transformation process, as executed, generally replaced large enterprises with small, creating an environment inimical to innovation but conducive to human capital flight.|$|R
