25|$|Acceleration of auroral charged {{particles}} invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which {{is believed to}} predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle {{in the direction of}} the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>waves,</b> produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Particle {{acceleration}} {{by means}} of nonlinear plasma wave interactions is of great topical interest. Accordingly, {{in this paper we}} focus on the electron surfing process. Self-consistent kinetic simulations, using both relativistic Vlasov and particle-in-cell (PIC) approaches, show here that electrons can be accelerated to highly relativistic energies (up to 100 m(e) c(2)) if the phase speed of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> is mildly relativistic (0. 6 c to 0. 9 c for the magnetic field strengths considered). The acceleration is strong because of relativistic stabilization of the nonlinearly saturated <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave,</b> seen in both relativistic Vlasov and PIC simulations. An inverse power law momentum distribution can arise for the most strongly accelerated electrons. These results are. of relevance to observed rapid changes in the radio synchrotron emission intensities from microquasars, gamma ray bursts and other astrophysical objects that require rapid acceleration mechanisms for electrons. ...|$|R

40|$|Nonthermal {{continuum}} (NTC) {{radiation is}} believed to be emitted by the conversion of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> into an electromagnetic one, which takes place at the Earth's magnetic equator. It is generally accepted that the frequency of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>wave</b> at the source meets a local characteristic frequency placed in between two multiples of the electron cyclotron frequency, fce, which results in emission of a narrow band frequency element. In an event on 14 August 2003, we compare oscillations of the central frequency of distinct NTC frequency elements observed from Cluster orbiting near perigee, with simultaneous Pc 5 Ultra Low Frequency (ULF) pulsations in the magnetic field observed from the same platform. The latter magnetic perturbations are interpreted as magnetohydrodynamic poloidal waves, where fundamental and second harmonic modes coexist. The NTC oscillation and the fundamental wave have similar periods, but are phase shifted by a quarter of period. From the correlation between both signals, and the proximity of the NTC source (localized via triangulation) with Cluster, we infer that the poloidal perturbations are spatially uniform between the source and the satellites.
