5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart <b>from</b> <b>mainstream</b> games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E

5|$|The Man-Eating Myth {{was widely}} {{reviewed}} in academic journals and also attracted attention <b>from</b> <b>mainstream</b> press. Views were mixed, with most reviewers highlighting the intentionally provocative {{nature of the}} work.

5|$|The early {{development}} of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds.

5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six {{did not mention}} the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers.

The film was released in the United States on a limited theatrical release on 30 April 2010. A sequel, entitled Full Sequence, also written and directed by Six, was released in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews <b>from</b> <b>mainstream</b> music critics; many contemporary reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. The most notable of the concerts were two Knebworth House performances in August to a combined crowd of 250,000 people. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared <b>from</b> <b>mainstream</b> economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
