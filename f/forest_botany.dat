40|$|Tree species {{information}} {{is essential for}} forest studies such as <b>forest</b> meteorology, <b>botany</b> and ecology, and across the relevant fields new techniques efficient for classifying tree species are desperately demanded. For this requirement, the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) shows the potential of handling it, since TLS can represent tree structures in details. However, the literature review suggests that the endeavors of introducing TLS into tree species classification are still in shortage. Aimed at this technical gap, this study attempted TLS for distinguishing four typical boreal tree species, i. e. Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European aspen (Populus tremula) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). After a theoretical comparison of the generic mechanisms of TLS- and airborne laser scanning (ALS) -based forest mapping, explicit tree structure (ETS) feature parameters, rather than conventional ALS-derived statistical-sense feature parameters, were proposed and derived from TLS point clouds. Then, based on a support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier, the specific classification was operated in a leave-one-out-for-cross-validation (LOOCV) mode. Tests indicated that the proposed TLS-based ETS feature parameters and the used classification algorithm can be validated for implementing the task of classifying the four tree species (the maximum total accuracy reaches 90. 00 % and the robust total accuracy reaches 77. 5 %). Overall, as a leading endeavor, this study has developed a procedural frame for TLS-based tree species classification...|$|R

He was appointed lecturer of <b>forest</b> <b>botany</b> and forest zoology at the University of Aberdeen. He continued his research on southern English beech forest in vacations and obtained a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1924. In 1929, he became lecturer of forestry at this university and, when this undergraduate subject was given up, lecturer of <b>forest</b> <b>botany</b> - [...] "a title which scarcely reflected his wide interest in and influence on plant ecology". He retired from university in 1959, but continued work - publishing in the Journal of Ecology as late as 1982, 63 years after his first publication in this journal.

40|$|Today, {{more than}} 50 % of the world's {{population}} {{lives in the}} cities and is subject to particular environmemntal and economic impacts {{against the backdrop of}} an envolving planetary crisis. This book explores the intimate relationship between {{the quality of life of}} city dwellers and the quality of urban landscapes, including those regenerated through green spaces and environmental networks. Starting from the concept of "landscape" as defined by the European Landscape Convention ("an area, perceived by people, whose character is the risult of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors"), it expands upon, in particular, the interactions between the different biotic and abiotic components that contribute to the quality of the landscape and the environment. In the first part of the book, the author examines fundamental concepts and discusses a variety of relevant topics, such as the city under transformation, waste spaces, smart communities, regeneration programs, the role of the environmental networks, and new instruments for decision making. The second part of the book is devoted to a case study of the Italian Adriatic city that highlights the need for interdisciplinary interaction among researchers in apparently disparate fields, including ecology, <b>forest</b> <b>botany,</b> chemistry, biology, geology, sociology, economics, architecture, and engineering...|$|E
40|$|Variability in {{the genetic}} {{information}} DNA tracking individuals carry {{is easy to}} detect using molecular markers. In the thesis we examined related Dracaena species. For the study of genetic diversity in the genus Dracaena are used mainly noncoding regions of cpDNA, spacer trnH [...] psbA, regions trnL [...] trnF and trnS [...] trnG [...] trnG, which are more variable than coding regions. Also used in this work were coding regions of matK and rbcL. In the genus Dracaena belongs xerophytic species that are characterized by typical shaped treetop. 14 representatives of species were used in thesis growing in tropical regions of the African continent and adjacent islands and the southeastern part of the Arabian peninsula. They are monocotyledonous trees with atypical abilities of secondary thickness of trunk, which I find interesting. The massive trunk is very strong and there is potencial to used it for wood. Trees are very significant for their red plant sap which flowing from demaged trunk. The sap is very precious resource which is used {{in many areas of}} industry, for example pharmacy, traditional medicine, dye making etc. Determination of genetic affinity was based on an amplification of cpDNA template of individual Dracaena samples with primers for the studied regions. Data was obtained and evaluated by Multiple alignment program ClustalX and BioEdit after their sequencing. Evalueted data was used to create dendograms affinity. According the resulting phylogenetic tree we find out similarities and identified relationship of the monitored species of the genus Dracaena. The main purpose of research was to get answers to understand phylogenetic relationship between group of Dracaena forestry used trees. The thesis was made in cooperation of Department of <b>Forest</b> <b>Botany,</b> Dendrology and Geobiocoenology, Faculty of Forestry and Wood Technology of Mendel University in Brno...|$|E
40|$|Hungarian dendrological {{research}} (research {{of living}} woody plants) {{has more than}} 200 years old history; the first general work by János Keresztély Grossinger was published in 1797. Further basic works in our time yet are: <b>Forest</b> <b>Botany</b> by Lajos Fekete and Sándor Mágócsy-Dietz (1896); and the chorological work, Distribution of trees and shrubs of sylvicultural importance {{in the region of}} Hungarian State by Lajos Fekete and Tibor Blattny (1913). A few dendrologists and many botanists have helped to get better knowledge of Hungarian dendroflora. From {{the point of view of}} taxonomy, chorology and habitat — which are interested by field botanists — it can be said that knowledge is fairly heterogeneous. There are sufficient information about most of the rare (protected/endangered) woody plants (an about 50 species) and the important adventives, above all invasive trees and shrubs (an about 10 species). From these two groups beyond there are only few taxa which can be said thoroughly worked up and known (e. g. Castanea sativa, Cornus mas, Fraxinus spp., Quercus spp.). List of the dendrotaxa, hardly known in the abovementioned point of view is rich in species that are important for forestry or horticulture (e. g. Alnus glutinosa, Acer spp., Betula pendula, Corylus avellana and most of Salix spp.), supplemented with other species (e. g. Clematis vitalba, Colutea arborescens, Lonicera xylosteum, Padus avium, Sambucus nigra, Staphylea pinnata, Viburnum spp.). Followings can be asked from our field botanists: i) look for a specialist in cases of critical dendrotaxa; ii) a circumspect identification is necessary — especially in the case of leaves — by right of great number of samples from the adequate part of shoot; iii) keep in view frequent hybridization (e. g. in the case of Betula, Crataegus, Pyrus, Tilia), and frequent appearance of hybrids (e. g. Betula × rhombifolia, Cerasus × eminens, Salix × rubens); iv) appearance of interim forms are usually typical in the cases of species classified into aggregate species (e. g. Quercus petraea agg., Qu. pubescens agg.); v) take intraspecific taxa according to various ecological demands, area, morphological differences into consideration; vi) culture variations cannot be treat as an equal with the species (e. g. Populus spp., Salix spp.); vii) natural ↔ artificial area have to be separated; viii) lend a helping hand in getting taxonomical knowledge of hardly known dendrotaxa...|$|E
