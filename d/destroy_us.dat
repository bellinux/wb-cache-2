5|$|To {{overcome}} the U.S. defenses at Camp Holloway, Tam organized the 30th Company into two sections. The first section, under Tam's direct command, was to <b>destroy</b> <b>U.S.</b> aircraft on the airfield, {{and establish a}} route of retreat for the attack force. The second section, led by Nguyen Trong Dai, was ordered to attack the U.S. advisory compound and the facilities where U.S. pilots and technicians were housed. The 30th Company was issued with four mortars and 70 mortar shells for their attack on Camp Holloway, and were reinforced by one combat engineer platoon, a special operations platoon and a local force company of Gia Lai Province. Viet Cong combat engineers were required {{to break through the}} wire fences which protected the U.S. facility at Camp Holloway, and protect the attack forces’ route of retreat using land mines. Meanwhile, the Gia Lai local force company had to set up ambush positions around the U.S. facility, to stop possible reinforcements.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{intervention}} in late October 1950 bolstered the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) of North Korea with the MiG-15, {{one of the}} world's most advanced jet fighters. The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and so could reach and <b>destroy</b> <b>U.S.</b> B-29 Superfortress bomber flights despite their fighter escorts. With increasing B-29 losses, the Air Force was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to a safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets.|$|E

Time was spent leisurely crafting the album; previous endeavors had been limited by deadlines. [...] "This time around, we said, 'Look, let's not just put out another record,'" [...] said Schwab, [...] "'Let's make sure we get the record {{to a place that}} we're happy with it.'" [...] The band focused on a heavy metal sound. However, they did not entirely jettison their 1980s influences as synthesizers percolated several songs. Schwab's lyrics focused on his belief that power and corruption often [...] "run hand-in-hand when it comes to human souls." [...] "The world is teaching us that fame is to be sought after; that recognition will equal success, fortune and, ultimately, peace," [...] he said, [...] "But the search for and attainment of fame and wealth usually <b>destroy</b> <b>us</b> in the end." ...|$|E

Landy was then credited as co-writer and executive producer for Wilson's eponymous solo album released in 1988. Co-producer Russ Titelman disparaged {{his role in the}} album's creation, calling him disruptive and [...] "anti-creative". Brian's cousin and bandmate Mike Love denied Landy's claims that the Beach Boys were preventing Brian from participating on their recordings, commenting: [...] "Why would anyone bother with us, his thinking apparently went, when the only Beach Boy who mattered was recording and performing on his own? I finally saw Landy for what he was. His goal was not to drive a wedge between Brian and us. It was to <b>destroy</b> <b>us.</b> Then he would be the sole custodian of Brian's career and legacy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{shortest}} (great circle) {{route for}} a Russian air attack on North America {{is through the}} Arctic, across the North Pole.

[...] The original DEW line was designed to detect bombers and was unable to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). [...] To give warning of this threat, in 1958 a more sophisticated radar system was constructed, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS).|$|E

2500|$|Ruth Fischer {{argued that}} the Communist Party of Germany leaders were saying: [...] "In no {{circumstances}} must we proclaim the general strike. The bourgeoisie will discover our plans and <b>destroy</b> <b>us</b> before we have moved. On the contrary, we must calm the masses, hold back our people in the factories and the unemployed committees until the government thinks the moment of danger has passed." [...] In April 1924 the 9th party convention elected her and Maslow co-chairpersons of the Communist Party of Germany. Both criticised by Joseph Stalin, Fischer, intending to defend Maslow (meanwhile arrested for participation in preparing an uprising in Germany planned for 1923), travelled to Moscow arriving there in September 1925 and was held for the following ten months in the Hotel Lux. Meanwhile Ernst Thälmann replaced Fischer and Maslow. Joseph Stalin arranged {{for them to be}} expelled from the party in August 1926.|$|E
2500|$|The radar {{was built}} in the Cold War to give early warning of a nuclear attack, to allow time for US bombers to get off the ground and {{land-based}} US missiles to be launched, to decrease the chance that a preemptive strike could <b>destroy</b> <b>US</b> strategic nuclear forces. [...] The deployment of submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) by the Soviet Union by the 1970s significantly decreased the warning time available between the detection of an incoming enemy missile and its reaching its target, because SLBMs can be launched closer to the US than the previous ICBMs, which have a long flight path from the Soviet Union to the continental US. [...] Thus there was a need for a radar system with faster reaction time than existing radars. [...] PAVE PAWS later acquired a second mission of tracking satellites and other objects in Earth orbit as part of the United States Space Surveillance Network.|$|E
2500|$|Responses to {{scientific}} achievements were colored by cultural skepticism. Scientists and their expertise were looked upon with suspicion. In 1968, an immensely popular work, The Biological Time Bomb, {{was written by}} the British journalist Gordon Rattray Taylor. The author's preface saw Kornberg's discovery of replicating a viral gene as a route to lethal doomsday bugs. The publisher's blurb for the book warned that within ten years, [...] "You may marry a semi-artificial man or woman…choose your children's sex…tune out pain…change your memories…and live to be 150 if the scientific revolution doesn’t <b>destroy</b> <b>us</b> first." [...] The book ended with a chapter called [...] "The Future – If Any." [...] While it is rare for current science to be represented in the movies, in this period of [...] "Star Trek", science fiction and science fact seemed to be converging. [...] "Cloning" [...] became a popular word in the media. Woody Allen satirized the cloning of a person from a nose in his 1973 movie Sleeper, and cloning Adolf Hitler from surviving cells was {{the theme of the}} 1976 novel by Ira Levin, The Boys from Brazil.|$|E

2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then <b>destroy</b> <b>us</b> all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a result, some sixteen {{months into}} the European War he was {{expelled}} from the United States for complicity in the planning of acts of sabotage, such as the Vanceboro international bridge bombing to <b>destroy</b> <b>US</b> rail lines. On 28 December 1915, he was declared persona non grata after his exposure and was recalled to Germany. Setting out on the journey, his luggage was confiscated, and 126 cheque stubs were found showing payments to his agents. Papen went on to report on American attitudes, both to General Erich von Falkenhayn and to Wilhelm II, the German Emperor. Even after returning to Germany, Papen remained involved in plots in the Americas as he contacted in February 1916 the Mexican Colonel Gonzalo Enrile, living in Cuba, {{in an attempt to}} arrange German support for Félix Díaz, the would-be strongman of Mexico. Papen arranged for Enrile to go to Berlin in April 1916 to pick up the money he said he needed to make Díaz president, though these plans were derailed when the Germans objected to Enrile's demand that he needed [...] "only" [...] a sum equal to $300 million US in 2016 values to overthrow President Venustiano Carranza. Papen also served as an intermediary between the Irish Volunteers and the German government regarding the purchase and delivery of arms to be used against the British during the Easter Rising of 1916, as well as serving as an intermediary with the Indian nationalists in the Hindu-German Conspiracy. In April 1916, a United States federal grand jury issued an indictment against Papen for a plot to blow up Canada's Welland Canal, which connects Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, but Papen was by then safely home; he remained under indictment until he became Chancellor of Germany, at which time the charges were dropped. As a Roman Catholic, Papen belonged to the Zentrum, the right of the center party that almost all German Catholics supported, but {{during the course of the}} war, the nationalist conservative Papen became estranged from his party. Papen disapproved of Matthias Erzberger, whose efforts to pull the Zentrum to the left, he was opposed to and regarded the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 19 July 1917 as almost treason.|$|E
