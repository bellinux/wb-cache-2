5000|$|These routes use {{a mix of}} bus types, {{ranging from}} transit-style buses with hard seats to [...] "semi-{{suburban}}" [...] buses (with highback, non-reclining seats) to full suburban buses (with a single <b>door,</b> luggage <b>racks</b> and personal reading lights). These routes are also unidirectional, traveling into downtown Phoenix in the morning (using the major freeways after traveling on surface streets {{for part of the}} trip) and out of downtown in the afternoons.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars have}} {{features}} that resemble passenger carriages on existing intercity services, such as single-leaf <b>doors,</b> luggage <b>racks</b> and transverse seating. During the overhaul drive 2008, {{it was seen}} {{that a number of}} class 81's were refurbished such that there would be larger standing areas near the doors while enlarging the narrow bottle-necking corridors surrounding the doors. The Class 81 is now operated with a designated female coach at the middle (or second car) of the train set.|$|R
5000|$|Toaster oven: Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with a front <b>door,</b> wire <b>rack</b> and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale.|$|R
5000|$|The bus had two <b>doors</b> and a <b>rack.</b> It had a [...] engine. The bus had {{seating for}} 22 {{passenger}} and standing {{room for a}} further 30 people. The vehicle was 11 m in length. It {{was based on a}} body from Ambrosini.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{original}} buildings was a large log cabin. The interior of the cabin, including the accessories, was built entirely from logs and branches of trees. The beds, light fixtures, towel <b>racks,</b> <b>door</b> openers, even the toilet paper holders, are made from logs and tree branches. These pieces were gathered by the brother of Elbert Hubbard, of Roycroft fame, who spent untold hours walking through the woods looking for branches of just the right shape for various purposes in the cabin.|$|R

50|$|Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with a front <b>door,</b> wire <b>rack</b> and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale. They can be used to cook toast with toppings, like garlic bread or cheese, though they tend to produce drier toast since their heating elements are located farther from the toast (to allow larger items to be cooked). They take 4-6 minutes to make toast as compared to 2-3 minutes in pop-up toasters. Since the toast lies on bars in a toaster oven, the toast will have untoasted stripes on one side. The evidence from product testing does not indicate that convection oven toaster ovens perform better than regular toaster ovens. People wishing to make large amounts of toast in a toaster oven should check the size before purchase, as even seemingly large toaster ovens may not fit six standard-size pieces of bread.|$|R
50|$|It came {{in three}} trim levels, CE, LE, and XLE. The LE and XLE models were {{equipped}} with 2nd row captain's chairs while the CE models came {{equipped with a}} 2nd row 2-passenger bench seat. The seats can be easily folded and individually removed as needed. The driver side sliding <b>door</b> and roof <b>rack</b> were standard on the LE and XLE models, but were optional on the CE models. The XLE models offered leather seats and a wood trim package. The Sienna also touted best-in-class fuel economy of 16 mpg city driving and 22 mpg highway driving. It was built in Georgetown, Kentucky. A year after its release, the Sienna faced new competition from the redesigned Honda Odyssey minivan, which was larger and offered a V6 like the Sienna.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{quantifying}} {{the impacts of}} a Cable Management Arm and the doors of an IT equipment rack on the airflow through a 1 U server. While Dell has historically tested rack-mounted servers and storage equip-ment in an IT rack, the results were used as a pass/fail criteria for qualifying the thermal design of the server. The impact of individual components of the <b>rack</b> deployment (<b>Doors,</b> CMA, Cabling, etc.) was not, however, indi-vidually documented. A combination of customer inquiries, a desire to vali-date design standards, and a limited body of readily available literature on the topic sparked interest in a methodical approach to documenting these effects. The analysis that follows {{is based on a}} Dell ™ PowerEdge™ 1950 III server, a 1 U server that uses front-to-back cooling, housed in a Dell PowerEdge 4210 rack. The empirical data collected by Dell in this study to illustrate the interactions between the rack infrastructure and the server showed that the effects of the <b>rack</b> <b>doors</b> and CMA individually were very similar, each in the 3 % range, and did not have a concerning impact on th...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 IBM reintroduced {{water cooling}} {{technology}} into its high performance computing platform, the Power 575 Supercomputing node/system. Water cooled cold plates {{were used to}} cool the processor modules which represented {{about half of the}} total system (rack) heat load. An air-to-liquid heat exchanger was also mounted in the rear <b>door</b> of the <b>rack</b> to remove a significant fraction of {{the other half of the}} rack heat load: the heat load to air. The next generation of this platform, the Power 775 Supercomputing node/system, is a monumen-tal leap forward in computing performance and energy efficiency. The computer node and system were designed from the start with water cooling in mind. The result, a system with greater than 96 % of its heat load conducted directly to water, is a system that, together with a rear door heat exchanger, removes 100 % of its heat load to water with no requirement for room air conditioning. In addition to the processor, the memory, power conversion, and I/O electronics conduct their heat to water. Included within the framework of the system is a disk storage unit (disc enclosure) containing an interboard air-to-water heat exchanger. This paper will give an overview of the water cooling system featuring the water conditioning unit and rack manifolds. Advances in technology over this system’s predecessor will b...|$|R
60|$|They {{were the}} last words the men spoke. For two rifle shots cracked from the thicket beside the road; two shots aimed with such deliberateness and {{precision}} that the two men, mortally stricken, collapsed where they stood, hanging {{for a brief moment}} over the dashboard before they rolled over on the horses' backs. Nor did they remain there long, for the next moment they were seized by half a dozen shadowy figures and with the horses and their cut traces dragged into the thicket. A half dozen and then a dozen other shadows flitted and swarmed over, in, and through the coach, reinforced by still more, until the whole vehicle seemed to be possessed, covered, and hidden by them, swaying and moving with their weight, like helpless carrion beneath a pack of ravenous wolves. Yet even while this seething congregation was at its greatest, at some unknown signal it as suddenly dispersed, vanished, and disappeared, leaving the coach empty--vacant and void of all that had given it life, weight, animation, and purpose--a mere skeleton on the roadside. The afternoon wind blew through its open <b>doors</b> and ravaged <b>rack</b> and box {{as if it had been}} the wreck of weeks instead of minutes, and the level rays of the setting sun flashed and blazed into its windows as though fire had been added to the ruin. But even this presently faded, leaving the abandoned coach a rigid, lifeless spectre on the twilight plain.|$|R
50|$|Carbon dioxide {{can be used}} to {{extinguish}} flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react {{to extinguish}} the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind <b>rack</b> <b>doors</b> and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space. International Maritime Organization standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of CO2 systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report, causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.|$|R
40|$|The Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) is a modular, multi-user, two-rack {{facility}} {{dedicated to}} combustion and fluids {{science in the}} US Laboratory Destiny on the International Space Station. FCF is a permanent facility {{that is capable of}} accommodating up to ten combustion and fluid science investigations per year. FCF research in combustion and fluid science supports NASA's Exploration of Space Initiative for on-orbit fire suppression, fire safety, and space system fluids management. The Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) is one of two racks in the FCF. The CIR major structural elements include the International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR), Experiment Assembly (optics bench and combustion chamber), Air Thermal Control Unit (ATCU), <b>Rack</b> <b>Door,</b> and Lower Structure Assembly (Input/Output Processor and Electrical Power Control Unit). The load path through the rack structure is outlined. The CIR modal survey was conducted to validate the load path predicted by the CIR finite element model (FEM). The modal survey is done by experimentally measuring the CIR frequencies and mode shapes. The CIR model was test correlated by updating the model to represent the test mode shapes. The correlated CIR model delivery is required by NASA JSC at Launch- 10. 5 months. The test correlated CIR flight FEM is analytically integrated into the Shuttle for a coupled loads analysis of the launch configuration. The analysis frequency range of interest is 0 - 50 Hz. A coupled loads analysis is the analytical integration of the Shuttle with its cargo element, the Mini Payload Logistics Module (MPLM), in the Shuttle cargo bay. For each Shuttle launch configuration, a verification coupled loads analysis is performed to determine the loads in the cargo bay as part of the structural certification process...|$|R
