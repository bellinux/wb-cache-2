5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used}} to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
50|$|Today {{there are}} several {{variations}} of the BDM methodology. In one common way, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> formulates a bid. The bid is compared to a price determined by a random number generator. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> bid {{is greater than the}} price, he or she pays the price and receives the item being auctioned. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> bid is lower than the price, he or she pays nothing and receives nothing.|$|R

3000|$|In such a case, {{the radius}} of C 1, C 2 and C 3 will be impacted. Let {{there be a}} factor defined, 0 <β < 1 by which the radius varies. In such a case, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> speed is more in time T_b than T_a, then to find the q in the radius R will modify to d(Ω,q)-β R. On <b>the</b> other hand <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject’s</b> speed is more at time T_a than T_b then to find q in the radius R will modify to (1 + 1 -β [...])R. So, in this case, to find q, in radius R, will modify to (2 -β)R-d(Ω,q) [...].|$|R

25|$|If direct flash must be used, a {{good rule}} of thumb is to {{separate}} the flash from the lens by 1/20 of the distance of the camera to the subject.

25|$|Another {{function}} of the padalyvis is to explain (precise) another verb by indicating a secondary action of which the subject is not the agent: Vartydamas seną albumą, prisiminiau mus šiame ežere maudydavusis – While seing an old photo album, I remembered us having used to swim in this lake. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is the agent, an adjectival participle must be used instead.|$|E
40|$|The authors used {{laboratory}} rats (Rattus norvegicus) {{of known}} relatedness and contrasting familiarity {{to assess the}} potential effect of preexperimental social experience on subsequent social recognition. The authors used the habituation-discrimination technique, which assumes that multiple exposures to a social stimulus (e. g., soiled bedding) ensure a <b>subject</b> discriminates between <b>the</b> habituation stimulus and a novel stimulus when both are introduced simultaneously. The authors observed a strong discrimination <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had different amounts of preexperimental experience with the donors of the 2 stimuli but a weak discrimination <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had either equal amounts of preexperimental experience or no experience with the stimuli. Preexperimental social experience does, therefore, appear to influence decision making in subsequent social discriminations. Implications for recognition and memory research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|When {{subjects}} {{are asked to}} recognize a picture, the performance is impaired by previous display of a degraded one of it. This phenomenon is called the part-set cuing effect. In the present research, the conditions on which this effect occured were investigated. In Experiment I, the results showed that, by displaying more than one steps of the degraded ones of the same picture, the recognition of this picture {{was more likely to}} be impaired. In Experiment II, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had studied <b>the</b> Chinese characters in a group were similar in meaning or were selected randomly, while they were dissimilar in shape. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> had not studied these characters beforehand, the effect occured in the shape-similar group and the randomly - selected group. An activation-bias hypothesis was given not to explain all these results. 部分线索的干扰作用一度是字表学习任务中的一个热门课题，对于这种效应的原因，一直有着不同的解释，随着部分线索效应研究的扩展，这种部分线索的干扰作用在更广泛的认知任务中得到了证实，因此，对部分线索效应的解释也需要有进一步的发展。在本研究中，我们尝试性的提出了一种新的解释：激活-偏离假设，为验证这个假设进行了两个实验，首先，在实验一中，我们以加随机点模糊图形的方法，考察了先呈现不同程度模糊级图形（阈限下水平）对这个图形确认级（阈限上水平）的认知过程的影响，在轮廓相似组图形中，部分线索的干扰作用随呈现模糊级次数的增加而更明显，在轮廓非相似图形中，模糊级呈现次数为 2 和 3 次的情况下，也表现出了明显的部分线索的干扰作用，实验二进一步在汉字识别任务中考察了部分线索效应，在事先学习的条件下，形状相似组汉字表现出了部分线索的干扰作用，而意义相似组和随机字组汉字表现出了部分线索的促进作用。在事先不学习的条件下，随机字组和形状相似组汉字表现出了部分线索的干扰作用，激活-偏离假设对这些结果都作出了比较合理的解释...|$|R

30|$|However, {{there are}} {{drawbacks}} to current subjective measures. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> must self-evaluate their performance and their cognitive capacity.

The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
