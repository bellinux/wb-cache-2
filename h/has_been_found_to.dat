5|$|Excessive {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and asthma.

5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue, bupropion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{be more effective}} than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E

5|$|PSR B1534+11 is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of two neutron stars orbiting each other, {{one of which is}} a pulsar with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, validating the system's relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory. The X-ray emission from the system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be present when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial pulsar wind of the pulsar, and the system's orbit <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary slightly.|$|E

50|$|Diet and {{nutrition}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> affect serum IGF-1 levels. Specifically, low protein intake, fasting, and malnourishment {{are associated with}} low IGF-1 levels, whereas obesity is associated with high or normal IGF-1 levels and lowered IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 levels (resulting in higher free IGF-1 concentrations). In addition, milk consumption and circulating IGF-1 levels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively correlated. Aside from diet {{and nutrition}}, exercise <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> significantly increase GH levels.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be problematic.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{correlative}} epidemiological studies have implicated selenium deficiency (measured by blood levels) {{in a number}} of serious or chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. In addition, selenium supplementation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be a chemopreventive for some types of cancer in some types of rodents.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> increase {{in response to}} rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
40|$|Experiencing health {{problems}} can produce strong emotional responses that may impact psychological well-being and disease outcome. Also emotional states <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{associated with the}} development of disease. Negative emotions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with health complaints. Conversely, positive emotions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with better health. Emotions may affect health indirectly by influencing behaviors known to be associated with health outcomes or through physiological mechanisms such as physiological reactivity and changes in immune functioning. Approaches for helping people deal more effectively with negative emotions and maximize positive ones are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> suggest {{that any of the}} native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{has been}} placed in the {{subfamily}} Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Attaleinae, together with the genera Allagoptera, Beccariophoenix, Butia, Cocos, Jubaea, Jubaeopsis, Lytocaryum, Parajubaea, Syagrus and Voanioala. Within this subtribe, Attalea <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be a monophyletic group, and sister to the clade containing Allagoptera, Polyandrococos, Parajubaea, Butia and Jubaea.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae.
