50|$|In 2002, BUPA Ireland made a {{complaint}} to the European Commission, claiming that risk equalization constituted state aid, as transfers {{were likely to}} take place from BUPA Ireland to VHI Healthcare, and the latter {{is owned by the}} state. The Commission investigated and, in 2003, it determined that transfers under the equalization scheme did not constitute state aid. BUPA withdrew from the Irish health insurance market on 14 December 2006 by selling the Irish company to new owners. The company continued with its legal challenge on the issue of community rating and the application of the risk <b>equalization</b> <b>levy.</b> The Irish Supreme Court has since found for the Irish company, on the grounds that community rating {{is not the same as}} risk equalization, and the whole issue of VHI's predominantly-older clientele is now back in the hands of government, which has declared that it is not in a rush to move to propose new legislation.|$|E

The Netherlands {{at the time of}} writing has no plans to introduce similar taxes. The new taxes disturb the level playing field (risk of double taxation), complicate the tax system and are not transparent as the legislation is generally not accessible at all and if so most times not in English on the Internet. Little information is available on the economic and juridical effects of the diverted profit tax and equalization taxes. Research on the economic effects of carbon taxes is available, but little attention has been paid thus far to the juridical aspects of these taxes. The author argues international organizations should provide more guidance...|$|E
5000|$|The {{classical}} {{test for}} the dividing line {{is seen in the}} contrast between two cases decided a few years apart, both involving taxes levied by the city of Denver Colorado. In 1908, in Londoner v. City and County of Denver, a tax levied on residents of a particular street was held to be an adjudication, and the Supreme Court ordered the city to do a [...] "do over," [...] because the residents of the street were not given sufficient opportunity to be heard. Then, in 1915, in Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of <b>Equalization,</b> a tax <b>levied</b> on the entire city of Denver was held to be rulemaking, and the city's action of imposing the tax was affirmed.|$|R
