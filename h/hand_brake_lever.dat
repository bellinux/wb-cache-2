50|$|The Premier cyclecar was {{launched}} in 1912. Described at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show as 'a smart looking two-seater vehicle with coachwork torpedo-type body at 100 guineas'. The engine was a 998 cc air-cooled V-twin (85mm bore, 88mm stroke) with special heavy flywheel for cyclecar work and Bosch magneto. The transmission included a leather cone clutch and two speed gearbox (with reverse), and the rear axle included a differential, there was enclosed chain drive throughout. The chassis was of 'tubular trussed construction' with half elliptic front springing and quarter elliptic rear. The brakes comprised a foot operated band brake operating on the transmission countershaft, and two internally expanding brakes on the rear axle operated by the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E

50|$|The usual foot (transmission) and <b>hand</b> (back wheels) <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> are provided. The {{pressed steel}} frame is {{suspended}} by three-quarter elliptic springs {{at the rear}} and semi-elliptic in front. The steering gear incorporates a provision to take up wear.|$|R
50|$|STI ("Shimano Total Integration") - The {{marketing}} terminology for {{the integration}} of shifting into the <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> for road bikes, enabling the rider to shift without taking the <b>hands</b> off the <b>brake</b> <b>levers.</b> This {{made it possible to}} shift during uphill passages that require getting out of the saddle, and added general convenience for the rider. Although first generation of STI was unable to downshift multiple cogs which wasn't a problem in downtube shifters.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1972, {{the more}} {{upmarket}} R12 TS was introduced. It {{used the same}} 1289 cc engine as in other R12s, but was equipped with a single, double barrel Weber carburettor, which increased power to [...] and raised the top speed to 150 km/h. Aesthetically, the car was distinguishable from other R12s by its special Gordini-style wheels, a chrome strip {{along the side of}} the car, and in some countries, two extra headlights. The TS also featured integrated headrests, a tachometer and a cooling-fluid temperature gauge. October 1972 was also when the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> was relocated from a position ahead of the driver to a floor-mounted location between the front seats. [...] This became possible because now, even on the base [...] "L" [...] version of the car, the front bench seat was replaced by two individual seats.|$|E
50|$|Its central {{hydraulic}} system, powering the four disc brakes (inboard in front to help lower unsprung weight) and the advanced hydro-pneumatic self-levelling suspension, {{was derived from}} the Citroën DS. It also has a feature that increased or decreased braking pressure in accordance with cargo load, without any noticeable difference in the brake pedal response. The powered system was different from the typical assisted systems in that there was virtually no travel on the brake pedal even when braking hard. The hydraulic suspension allowed the car to be raised for rough terrain at low speeds (a feature taking account of the country lanes of its native France) and to full height for easy access to the partially enclosed rear wheels. The <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> is mounted on the dashboard as opposed to being mounted between the front seats. In car entertainment can be fitted in the space that would have been utilised by the handbrake. As with other Citroën cars, the hydraulic system depressurizes over several hours, so the car will sink to the bump stops when the engine is off.|$|E

50|$|The Cineston {{evolved from}} the rotary {{controllers}} used to control the power delivered to the electric traction motors in early mass transit systems. In early systems, notably those found in trams, the motor control was operated by the left <b>hand,</b> and the <b>brakes</b> by the right <b>hand.</b> Typically the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> also included a dead man's switch that released air pressure to activate the air brakes in an emergency. In the Cineston, motor control and brake controls are combined in a single lever's rotary motion, and the dead man's switch is implemented in a vertical motion.|$|R
5000|$|The 1934 Model 355D was {{completely}} restyled and mounted on {{an entirely new}} chassis but used the same engine as in 1933. The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by Fisher and on the Series 30 by Fleetwood. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the Cadillac V-12 and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was {{a feature of the}} overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. Windshields were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. Cowl vents opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were 2.0 in lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the <b>hand</b> <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> {{to the left of the}} driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called [...] "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.|$|E

2500|$|The {{handlebars}} {{turn the}} fork {{and the front}} wheel via the stem, which rotates within the headset. Three styles of handlebar are common. Upright handlebars, the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. Drop handlebars [...] "drop" [...] as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic [...] "crouched" [...] position, {{as well as more}} upright positions in which the <b>hands</b> grip the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> for each <b>brake</b> to facilitate <b>braking</b> from multiple <b>hand</b> positions.
