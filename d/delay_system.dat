The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's <b>delay</b> <b>system.</b> The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans". McCarthy said that the gesture was not made during rehearsals, and M.I.A. improvised it on stage. The Federal Communications Commission received 222 complaints about the rapper's gesture, and Rolling Stone reported that the commission might [...] "punish" [...] the NFL and NBC despite their apologies. Any fine imposed on the NFL would be charged to M.I.A., since the rapper had signed a contract [...] indemnifying the league against FCC fines. A year later, {{it was reported that}} the NFL had filed a $1.5 million arbitration claim against M.I.A. for [...] "breach of her contract and flagrant disregard for the values that form the cornerstone of the NFL brand and the Super Bowl". Her lawyer, Howard King, filed a counterclaim calling the NFL's action [...] "hilarious in light of the weekly felonies committed by its stars". M.I.A. enlisted the help of fans in documenting objectionable actions by the NFL to refute the league's claim of damage to its reputation.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} gained widespread {{attention from}} the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse instead of singing the word [...] "shit". Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. People said, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do during the show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's <b>delay</b> <b>system.</b> The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans." [...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage. [...] The league later fined the rapper a total of $16.6 million as penalty, which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014.|$|E
