5|$|After his death, Grayburn's {{was buried}} {{on the bridge}} {{embankment}} close {{to where he was}} killed. It was recovered in 1948 and added to the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery. Although most graves in the cemetery are organised by unit, Grayburn's <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from the other parachute formations. His VC is in the care of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum and there are plaques in his memory at Chalfont St Giles parish church, and at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation war memorial in Hong Kong, where Grayburn's uncle worked before the war. He is also commemorated on the Sherborne School War Memorial and in the Sherborne School Book of Remembrance. A room in the clubhouse of Amersham and Chiltern Rugby Club is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the roadway}} loops around itself at a {{section in the}} roadway locally known as The Helix, {{descending}} the New Jersey Palisades to reach {{the entrance to the}} Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson River. The route has a westbound exit for CR677 (John F. Kennedy/Hudson Boulevard East) and another exit for Boulevard East with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. After interchanging with Boulevard East, the road features an eastbound toll plaza and enters the Lincoln Tunnel. At the New York state line, which is located at the midpoint of the Hudson River, the road continues as NY 495, which <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from I-495, and heads into Midtown Manhattan in New York City.|$|E

5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eukaryotic}} cell, the cytosol {{is within}} the cell membrane and {{is part of the}} cytoplasm, which also comprises the mitochondria, plastids, and other organelles (but not their internal fluids and structures); the cell nucleus <b>is</b> <b>separate.</b> The cytosol is thus a liquid matrix around the organelles. In prokaryotes, most of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the periplasmic space. In eukaryotes, while many metabolic pathways still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber <b>is</b> <b>separate,</b> and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E

5|$|A less pure form of Limousin is bred up (also {{known as}} graded up) from a base animal over a defined number of generations. A parent of each generation's progeny must be {{registered}} as a Limousin in the respective country's herd book. In the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a graded up Limousin, after three generations for females and four generations for males, is known (confusingly {{with the legal}} European definition) as purebred, which is then eligible for recording in the respective countries' herd books alongside Fullblood and French Pure Limousins. Unlike the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which allow both purebred and Full French bulls and dams {{to be used for}} grading up, in Britain grading up can only occur using Full French bulls. British graded up females when they reach fourth generation from a non-Limousin base cow can then be registered as Limousins in the British Limousin Pedigree Register. The British Limousin Pedigree Register <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from the British Limousin Herd Book, which is reserved for animals that have complete Full French ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} road to reach {{what was then}} Wheeling, Virginia, was a post road linking it with Morgantown, to the southeast. The post road was completed in 1794. The National Road was the first interstate road that served Wheeling, linking the town to Cumberland, Maryland, in the east. The National Road started construction under order of then President Thomas Jefferson in 1806 and was completed in 1818. In 1926 the United States Numbered Highway System was established, and the National Road through the Northern Panhandle was designated US40. US40 linked Vallejo, California, {{in the west to}} Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the east. Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 formed the Interstate Highway System, designating as I-70 a then unconstructed controlled-access highway across the panhandle by 1957. Since it was constructed as a separate controlled-access highway, much of I-70 <b>is</b> <b>separate</b> from the old National Road and US40.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof.
