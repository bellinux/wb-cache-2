5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Samsung's Chairman Lee Kun-hee {{recognised}} {{the automotive industry}} as the culmination of several others. For the Samsung Group, this would allow to leverage resources and technologies from the entire group including Samsung <b>Electrics</b> and Samsung Electronics. He initially tried {{to take control of}} Kia, but competition from other bidders and legal restrictions made him to drop the idea. Kia was eventually purchased by Hyundai.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{sold the}} Tigers and {{purchased}} the Butte Miners of the Northwestern League in 1916, serving as player-manager and bringing with him several players from Tacoma. In June 1917, {{he sold his}} stock in the team and secured his release. He played for the Great Falls <b>Electrics</b> of the Northwestern League {{for the remainder of}} the 1917 season.|$|E
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and <b>electrics</b> of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated <b>electrics</b> with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (Auxiliary power unit) and Ram Air Turbine (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most {{aircraft}} in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the <b>electrics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cumulative global {{sales of}} highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and light utility vehicles passed the one million unit milestone in September 2015, and two million in December 2016. The Renault-Nissan Alliance is the world's leading all-electric vehicle manufacturer. The Alliance reached sales of 424,797 all-electric vehicles delivered globally {{at the end}} of 2016, including the pure <b>electrics</b> manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors, now part of the Alliance. The Alliance, including Mitsubishi Motors i-Miev series, sold globally 94,265 all-electric vehicles in 2016. Nissan alone totaled 275,000 global electric vehicle sales in December 2016. Renault global electric vehicle sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan <b>Electrics.</b> His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|The stadium's {{interior}} comprises {{a continuous}} oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. Entry by patrons is gained by {{contactless smart card}} rather than traditional manned turnstiles. The system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute through all entrances. A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team's coach to enter the stadium directly. Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants, two of which have views of the pitch, and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north, west and east stands. The stadium is equip with stand-by generators {{should there be a}} electrical mains failure. These are capable of keeping the stadium <b>electrics</b> running as well as the floodlights at 800 lux, the minimum level stipulated by FIFA to continue to broadcast live football.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure <b>electrics</b> representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016. The global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled almost 800,000 units at the end of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah <b>electrics</b> are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum demand of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies electricity to the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and maximum demand of 203.3 MW.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics <b>electrics</b> functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Electrics</b> {{protected}} Navratilova for the 2000 season, {{and she was}} {{the only}} holdover player from the previous year. In the marquee player draft, the <b>Electrics</b> selected Mary Pierce, then ranked number 4 in the world, and Pierce committed to play at least three matches. In the roster draft, the <b>Electrics</b> selected Rita Grande, then the number 1 Italian player, Nannie DeVilliers, former WTT male rookie of the year Michael Hill and Brent Haygarth. The <b>Electrics</b> traded their own former male rookie of the year, Geoff Grant, to the Delaware Smash for cash consideration. The <b>Electrics</b> finished the season with 8 wins and 6 losses, second place in the Eastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Electrics</b> {{drafted the}} legendary Martina Navratilova as their marquee player {{prior to the}} 1999 season. Navratilova {{committed}} to play two matches. After losing their first two matches of the 1999 season, the <b>Electrics</b> bounced back {{in the next two}} matches to even their record. Jana Novotná, then ranked number 4 in the world, was scheduled to play for the <b>Electrics</b> in their fifth match. However, she had to pull out with a left ankle injury and never ended up appearing in a match for the <b>Electrics.</b> Despite the presence of Navratilova, the <b>Electrics</b> finished with 5 wins and 7 losses, fourth in WTT and lost to the Sacramento Capitals in the semifinals.|$|E
25|$|From 2002-2004 the L322 saw a {{standard}} BMW E39 <b>electrics</b> system.|$|E
25|$|From 2005-2009 the L322 saw {{an updated}} Jaguar derived <b>electrics</b> system with fibre optics and Bluetooth.|$|E
25|$|The Type A {{engine was}} copied from Chevrolet, and the chassis and <b>electrics</b> were copied from Ford.|$|E
25|$|Robert Boyle {{also worked}} {{frequently}} {{at the new}} science of electricity, and added several substances to Gilbert's list of <b>electrics.</b> He left {{a detailed account of}} his researches under the title of Experiments on the Origin of Electricity. Boyle, in 1675, stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum. One of his important discoveries was that electrified bodies in a vacuum would attract light substances, this indicating that the electrical effect did not depend upon the air as a medium. He also added resin to the then known list of <b>electrics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{the border}} in South Australia, the new 830 class diesel <b>electrics</b> began to {{displace}} branch line steam power. Most of the 750 class was withdrawn by 1962, with locomotive 752 steaming {{for the last time}} in November 1964.|$|E
25|$|The depot had {{originally}} been opened in 1923 by the London and North Eastern Railway, to house the previous Tyneside <b>Electrics</b> stock, and was then known as the South Gosforth Car Sheds. It was inherited by Metro upon the system's opening.|$|E
25|$|Govia Thameslink Railway {{operates}} {{a fleet of}} Gatwick Express branded s which it received during 2016. GTR placed a £145.2 million order with Bombardier for 27 sets of the type in November 2014 to replace the existing Class 442 Wessex <b>Electrics.</b>|$|E
25|$|On lap nine the <b>electrics</b> on Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari failed, {{leaving him}} to coast to the pits from half {{way around the}} track. Scott Speed's tyre failed spectacularly on the main {{straight}} shortly afterwards, leaving debris that remained there {{for the rest of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|The newer Ransomes buses, nos. 214–217, were {{typically}} {{used on the}} Marshland Road via Richmond route while no. 213 continued to be used on the North Beach route with the English <b>Electrics.</b> To this end, they had separate lanes at the central city depot so the appropriate vehicles were always available.|$|E
25|$|Bournemouth depot is {{southwest}} of Bournemouth station, occupying {{the approach to}} the former Bournemouth West station. Until their withdrawal in February 2007, the depot was home to the Class 442 (5Wes) Wessex <b>Electrics.</b> The branch turns off at Branksome station where trains can be seen stopping at platform 2 and reversing into the depot.|$|E
25|$|The British Rail Class 442 (Wessex <b>Electrics)</b> are a {{class of}} {{electric}} multiple-units introduced in 1988 by Network SouthEast on the South Western Main Line from London Waterloo to Weymouth {{to coincide with the}} electrification of the line from Bournemouth. Twenty-four five-car units were built by British Rail Engineering Limited's Derby Litchurch Lane Works.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1998 season, Capital District Off-Track Betting Corp. {{withdrew from}} its {{sponsorship}} {{agreement with the}} OTBzz, and the team {{changed its name to}} the Schenectady County <b>Electrics</b> for the 1999 season. The name of the team's location was changed from New York to Schenectady County in exchange for a subsidy approved by the Schenectady County legislature.|$|E
25|$|The Gatwick Express service {{received}} 17 refurbished Class 442 Wessex <b>Electrics</b> from South West Trains from December 2008, {{followed by}} a further seven through leases in 2009, after Southern retained the South Central franchise. The additional rolling stock allowed Southern to provide extra capacity on the Gatwick Express services extended to Brighton. The stock were replaced during 2016 by newly built Class 387/2s.|$|E
25|$|Professional {{baseball}} was played in Pittsfield's Wahconah Park from 1919 through 2003. Teams included the Pittsfield <b>Electrics</b> of the 1940s, the Pittsfield Red Sox from 1965-69 with such then A-league players and future major leaguers as George Scott, Carlton Fisk, and Reggie Smith, the Pittsfield Senators (later Rangers) of the 1970s, and the 1985-88 AA Pittsfield Cubs featuring future stars Mark Grace and Rafael Palmeiro.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to using}} a Stratocaster with Fairport Convention {{he used a}} Gibson Les Paul with P-90 pick-ups. he then {{switched}} to a late 60s Stratocaster. Since leaving Fairport Convention he has continued to use electric guitars with single coil pick-ups, most famously a late-1950s Stratocaster but also two custom built <b>electrics</b> by Danny Ferrington {{as well as other}} Stratocasters, various Telecaster-type guitars and, in the studio, a Danelectro U2.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand DM/D class (also {{known as}} English <b>Electrics)</b> were {{a class of}} {{electric}} multiple units used on the Metlink suburban rail network of Wellington, New Zealand. Formed of DM power cars and D trailer cars, the first units were ordered from English Electric in 1936 and introduced on 2 July 1938 operating the electrified Johnsonville Line service. Additional units were ordered in 1942 and 1946 as other Wellington suburban lines were electrified.|$|E
25|$|Merseyrail <b>Electrics</b> had a {{fleet of}} four Class 73/0 {{locomotives}} (Nos. 73 001, 73 002, 73 004*, 73 005 & 73 006), based at Birkenhead North TMD, for use on shunting and other departmental duties. Two, nos. 73001 and 73006 were repainted into Merseyrail's yellow livery. They were later fitted with sandite discharging equipment and reclassified as Class 73/9. The locomotives were withdrawn from traffic by 2002, and all four were later sold for preservation.|$|E
25|$|Diesel–hydraulic {{locomotives}} {{are less}} efficient than diesel–electrics. The first-generation BR diesel hydraulics {{were significantly less}} efficient (c. 65%) than diesel <b>electrics</b> (c. 80%) — moreover initial versions were found in many countries to be mechanically more complicated {{and more likely to}} break down. Hydraulic transmission for locomotives was developed in Germany. There is still debate over the relative merits of hydraulic vs. electrical transmission systems: advantages claimed for hydraulic systems include lower weight, high reliability, and lower capital cost.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were very subtle. The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the <b>electrics</b> and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more head room inside the car.|$|E
25|$|With {{electrification}} and {{the introduction}} of the EF class electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the Midland Line in the South Island. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the <b>electrics,</b> although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, however, {{outgoing}} CEO of GM Rick Wagoner {{said the}} biggest mistake he ever made as chief executive was killing the EV1 car and failing to direct more resources to <b>electrics</b> and hybrids after such an early lead in this technology. GM has since championed its electric-car expertise as {{a key factor in}} development of its 2010 Chevrolet Volt, the first electric car that uses a gas generator to create electricity when the battery is depleted, furthering the range by over 270 miles.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 a {{group of}} Yorkshire {{businessmen}} formed a consortium to establish an offshore radio station to broadcast to the North East coast from a location off Scarborough. Don Robinson, aged 28, who was an entertainments promoter, began the venture with Bill Pashby (a fishing boat skipper), Roland Hill (a poultry farmer) and Leonard Dale (owner of the Dale <b>Electrics</b> business at Gristhorpe). These recruited Wilf Proudfoot, owner of a chain of supermarkets and a former Conservative MP. The venture was incorporated within a public company named Ellambar Investments Ltd.|$|E
