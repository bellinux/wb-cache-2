5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Libya's prompt retreat {{took many}} {{observers}} by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire {{to host the}} OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, {{it would have been}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|It {{was more}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Koroni. General Sébastiani showed {{up there on}} October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander’s {{response}} was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E

Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a {{relatively}} regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home.|$|E

25|$|Tube length: heat {{exchangers}} are usually cheaper {{when they have}} a smaller shell diameter and a long tube length. Thus, typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> out and replace.|$|E
25|$|Although ground sloths were {{relatively}} easy to spot, this did not make hunting them easy. Big game hunters' weapons were useless if ground sloths were further than thirty feet away. Additionally, the ground sloths' already thick hide consisted of osteoderms, which made it exceptionally thick. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> down a ground sloth with a spear-thrower; killing a ground sloth required extensive knowledge of the species. Ground sloths' size and claws were strong enough to tear apart tree branches, making it dangerous for hunters to approach these animals.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, the Royal Navy {{numbered}} 268 warships, {{and by the}} end of {{the year}} it grew to a fleet force of 468 ships; its naval personnel increased during the war from 10,000 to 18,000. By contrast, the Continental Navy—including the state navies—had managed to maintain over 50 commissioned warships by winter of 1776–1777, which fell in numbers thereafter; its manpower most likely numbered no more than a total of 30,000 sailors and marines. To the hundreds of small privateers that sailed the North Atlantic, the American naval forces found it increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> prizes, let alone influence the outcome of the war.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{information}} regarding de Hory's early life comes from what he told American writer Clifford Irving, who wrote the first biography about him. Since de Hory's success was reliant upon his skills of deception and invention, it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the facts that he told about his own life at face value, as Clifford Irving himself admitted, Irving himself being convicted {{of the crime of}} forgery for his fictitious biography of Howard Hughes that he attempted to pass off as genuine. De Hory claimed that he was born into an aristocratic family, that his father was an Austro-Hungarian ambassador and that his mother came from a family of bankers. However, subsequent investigation has suggested that de Hory's childhood was, more likely, of a middle class variety.|$|E

Chinese siege engines {{were used by}} the Mongols under Tului to raze the walls of Russian cities. The most <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> was {{the small town of}} Kozelsk, whose boy-prince Vasily, son of Titus, and inhabitants resisted the Mongols for seven weeks, killing 4,000. As the story goes, at the news of the Mongol approach, the whole town of Kitezh with all its inhabitants was submerged into a lake, where, as legend has it, it may be seen to this day. The only major cities to escape destruction were Novgorod and Pskov. The Mongols planned to advance on Novgorod, but the principality was spared the fate of its brethren by the wise decision to preemptively surrender.|$|E

500|$|Gunn says of {{the move}} south: [...] "Norwich was easy to settle into, a bit like Aberdeen in many ways—a city {{surrounded}} by lovely countryside and lots of farms." [...] However, since he joined the club partway into the new season, he initially found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over as first-choice goalkeeper. Gunn had been bought {{as a replacement for}} England international goalkeeper Chris Woods, who had moved to Rangers F.C. Meanwhile, reserve team keeper Graham Benstead made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league. Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait. A 6–2 defeat at Anfield proved to be the catalyst for Gunn's promotion to the first team. He made his debut in a Full Members Cup win against Coventry City, conceding a penalty, and made his league debut in a 2–1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986.|$|E
500|$|The CD-I {{version was}} coded by Ashley Hogg. He stated {{that there were}} {{problems}} that only occurred on this console, and CD-Rs were expensive. The Game Gear team were originally against the [...] "on-rails" [...] handling of the Mega Drive version, and wanted to revert to the NES drifting. The Game Gear version was created by Ashley Routledge and Dave Saunders, who adjusted the Mega Drive graphics to the Game Gear's smaller screen. It was produced alongside the Mega Drive version, and programmed from scratch to run at 60 frames per second (FPS). The main problem was keeping as much detail as possible on the Game Gear's inferior storage and memory capabilities. Much of the art had to be redrawn with fewer colours at lower resolutions. The biggest problem was the screen size, which made it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> corners at high speeds. The team tweaked the camera movement so the vehicle was positioned further back, so players {{were able to see}} the track ahead according to how fast the vehicle is travelling. Another thing considered important was the lack of options screens, as it was felt players should be able to [...] simply play the game.|$|E

500|$|Two weeks later, {{he played}} his 100th AFL match in the sixty-eight point loss to Fremantle at the MCG in round five, {{a game in}} which he managed just seven disposals; after his {{milestone}} match he was condemned by Matthew Lloyd on the Nine Network's Footy Classified, saying [...] "he's been gifted 100 games of AFL football". In the thirty-eight point loss against Sydney at the MCG the next week, he started as the substitute with Paul Roos attempting to ease the burden on Watts, although Roos later admitted starting as the substitute probably increased pressure on Watts. The relentless pressure on Watts saw him omitted the next week for the round seven match against , although it initially appeared he was dropped by the coaching panel, it was later revealed by Paul Roos that Watts asked to be dropped so he could find form playing in the VFL. Leigh Matthews described Watts' decision to drop himself as a shock because it never happened in his twenty years of coaching and he found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> seriously. Recording twenty-four disposals, eight marks and a goal in the VFL, his performance was described as [...] "solid" [...] by AFL Media journalist, Peter Ryan and he was recalled to the senior side after the one week in the VFL for the thirty-nine point win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG.|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{maintained}} a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name {{he insisted on}} spelling [...] "Shakespear"). Many found him <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> seriously on the subject; Duff Cooper observed that by attacking Shakespeare, [...] "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." [...] Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and {{in an article in}} which he wrote, [...] "With the single exception of Homer, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," [...] he also said, [...] "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating [...] "Bardolaters", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, Cymbeline Refinished and Shakes versus Shav. In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: [...] "Shaw helps us {{to get away from the}} Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors." ...|$|E
