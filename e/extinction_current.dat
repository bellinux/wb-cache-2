However, the current utility regulations do not allow for the islanded operation. The arc faults are {{the one of the}} major issues preventing the islanded operation, since the arc will not extinguish if the DGs are not disconnected. In this paper, the effect of a converter interfaced DG on an arc fault is investigated by considering different control strategies for the converter.

In many cases, wild animal populations have been restricted to fragmented habitat islands due to anthropogenic developments, endangering them to local <b>extinction.</b> <b>Current</b> and future wildlife conservation and management strategies are leading to the implementation of mitigation measures such as creation of wildlife habitat corridors. In this light, novel and interdisciplinary research methods such as approaches in the field of landscape genetics are proving to be increasingly useful and necessary for assessing the status of wildlife populations and furthering efficacy of conservation programs and management efforts. In this 5 -year research study, I review literature in the field of landscape genetics, highlighting studies and their applications toward wildlife conservation over the past decade (2005 - 2014). I then use a landscape genetic approach to understand the potential impact of natural and human-made barriers in and around the northern Sonoran Desert on one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, the mountain lion (Puma concolor). I employ recently developed genetic tools to assess the current population genetic status of mountain lions in this region and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools to relate observations to landscape features through interpretive maps. I further investigate the utility of GIS and expert-based models in connectivity conservation and suggest validating them with information on genetic relatedness and functional connectivity among mountain lions.

The species has undergone a major decline throughout most of its range in the UK and its small populations are particularly vulnerable to local <b>extinction.</b> <b>Current</b> research ascertains that early successional vegetation, with a high abundance of host plants and the presence of the symbiotic Lasius ant species, is vital for the longevity of P. argus colonies which are increasingly threatened by fragmented and isolated habitats. This project forms an investigation into the spatial occurrence of the heathland species, Plebejus a argus across Studland Peninsula, a 350 -hectare area of dune, lowland heath, salt marsh, mire and open water habitat on the south-eastern side of Poole Harbour. At present, records from Butterfly Conservation transects document the presence of P. argus at Plateau Heath, on the oldest part of the peninsula, but {{there is no evidence of}} populations on the eastern side of the peninsula, despite apparently similar terrestrial components. This study investigates the distribution of P. argus across the peninsula and assesses the factors driving this distribution pattern. Results show a significant, positive association between P. argus with the host plant Erica tetralix (cross-leaved heath), short grass (2 - 5 cm) and the presence of the black ant Lasius niger, the latter which is distributed primarily on the western side of the peninsula despite the availability of suitable habitat conditions to the east. This research investigates the distribution of six heathland ants found at Studland and considers whether interspecific competition between Lasius niger with the red wood ant, Formica rufa, could be influencing the distribution of this myrmecophilous butterfly...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{development}} and urbanization of the Lower Florida Keys {{in the last}} 30 years has fragmented the habitat of the Lower Keys marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri) and threatened it with <b>extinction.</b> <b>Current</b> threats exist at multiple spatiotemporal scales and include threats due to development, invasive species, and global climate change. On Boca Chica Key, the Lower Keys marsh rabbit (LKMR) exists as a metapopulation on Naval Air Station-Key West (NASKW). I conducted a population viability analysis to determine the metapopulation's risk of extinction under multiple management scenarios by developing a spatially-explicit, stage-structured, stochastic matrix model using the programs RAMAS Metapop and ArcGIS. These management scenarios include clearance of airfield vegetation, habitat conversion, and control of feral cats as an invasive species. Model results provided the Navy with relative risk estimates under these different scenarios. Airfield clearance with habitat conversion increased extinction risk, but when coupled with feral cat control, risk was decreased. Because of the potential of sea-level rise due to human-induced global climate change, and its projected impact on the biodiversity of the Florida Keys, I estimated the impacts of rising sea levels on LKMR across its geographic distribution under scenarios of no, low (0. 3 m), medium (0. 6 m), and high (0. 9 m) sea-level rise. I also investigated impacts due to 2 treatments (allowing vegetation to migrate upslope and not allowing migration), and 2 land-use planning decisions (protection and abandonment of humandominated areas). Not surprisingly, under both treatments and both land-use planning decisions, I found a general trend of decreasing total potential LKMR habitat with increasing sea-level rise. Not allowing migration and protecting human-dominated areas both tended to decrease potential LKMR habitat as compared with allowing migration and abandoning human-dominated areas. In conclusion, conservation strategies at multiple scales need to be implemented {{in order to reduce}} threats to LKMR, such as development, invasive species, and global climate change...|$|E

40|$|Measures of <b>current</b> <b>extinction</b> risk {{imply that}} a high {{proportion}} of the world’s species are threatened with global extinction in the near future, stressing the need for thorough understanding of extinction processes. In this thesis, I investigate three aspects of <b>current</b> global species <b>extinction</b> risk, using novel phylogenetic and spatially-explicit comparative methods. First, I develop a new measure of the phylogenetic-signal strength in extinction risk, and use it to show that the nonrandomness in global mammalian extinction risk differs with threatening processes. These results imply that the biological traits which increase species’ susceptibility depend on the anthropogenic threat experienced. Secondly, I investigate the focus of <b>current</b> <b>extinction</b> risk, both spatially and in terms of biological traits increasing risk. I model regional extinction-risk correlates for mammals across the globe, finding strong geographical variation in the influence of biological traits on risk, and in trait interactions with anthropogenic impacts. I also compare biological and anthropogenic correlates of global extinction risk across and within mammals, birds and frogs. Results from this large-scale comparative study further confirm the strong heterogeneity of extinction processes, with taxon-specific traits playing a relatively large role in determining species’ fates. Finally, I estimate possible impacts of <b>current</b> <b>extinction</b> risk using three measures of global mammalian diversity: species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity. My results show that selective losses of large species will deplete functional variety in mammals, especially in the tropics. Loss of functional diversity is much higher than expected under random species loss, and there is low congruence with losses of species richness and phylogenetic diversity. The selectivity of <b>current</b> <b>extinction</b> risk means that we stand to lose a very biased sample of global diversity, with potentially severe consequences for ecosystem functioning.

As a corollary to this equivalence theorem, the fields predicted by integration of the physical optics (PO) surface currents and the Kottler-Franz integration of the geometrical optics (GO) aperture fields on S,, agree to within the locally plane-wave approximation inherent in PO and GO. Moreover, within the region of accuracy of the fields predicted by PO current or GO aperture field integration, the far fields predicted by the Kottler-Franz aperture integration are closely approximated by the far fields obtained from aperture integration of the tangential Fig. 1.

40|$|Predicting future species extinctions from {{patterns}} of past <b>extinctions</b> or <b>current</b> threat status {{relies on the}} assumption that the taxonomic and biological selectivity of extinction is consistent through time. If the driving forces of extinction change through time, this assumption may be unrealistic. Testing the consistency of extinction patterns between the past and the present has been difficult, because the phylogenetically explicit methods used to model present-day extinction risk typically cannot be applied to the data from the fossil record. However, the detailed historical and fossil records of the New Zealand avifauna provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct a complete, large faunal assemblage for different periods in the past. Using the first complete phylogeny of all known native New Zealand bird species, both extant and extinct, we show how the taxonomic and phylogenetic selectivity of extinction, and biological correlates of extinction, change from the pre-human period through Polynesian and European occupation, to the present. These changes can be explained both by changes in primary threatening processes, and by the operation of extinction filter effects.
