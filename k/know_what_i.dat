5|$|The Kind of Blue musicians {{appeared}} {{together in}} further recorded ventures through the 1960s. Davis {{had made a}} rare post-1953 sideman appearance in 1958 on Adderley's Somethin' Else album; Evans and Adderley collaborated on the latter's LP <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Mean? from 1961. Kelly and Chambers backed Hank Mobley on Soul Station in 1960, and Evans and Chambers played on the sessions for The Blues and the Abstract Truth by Oliver Nelson in 1961. The rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb backed Coltrane for Coltrane Jazz and one track on his landmark Giant Steps, which featured Chambers throughout. That trio stayed with Davis for the recordings Someday My Prince Will Come and the live sets at the Blackhawk and at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E
25|$|The {{video for}} Loop's 1990 single 'Arc-lite' was filmed {{on the set}} of Full Metal Jacket. The {{gasworks}} was used as the main background scene for the Oasis video 'D'You <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Mean?', as it shows the band members playing on a concrete slab within the gasworks. The videoclip for Marcella Detroit's 1994 single 'I Believe' was shot in this location. Also, the 1995 TV series Bugs episode 'Out Of The Hive' shows the entire works in a scene where a car drives off an unfinished bridge in flames.|$|E

25|$|Ghostface {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} numerous times in media following his {{appearance in the}} Scream series of slasher films, most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders and is later revealed to be several people as in Scream. In the parody film Shriek If You <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Did Last Friday the Thirteenth (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface {{turns out to be}} played by the orangutan, Suzann.|$|E

500|$|The {{album cover}} is a {{painting}} by Betty Swanwick titled The Dream. Swanwick had designed posters for London Transport between the 1930s and 1950s.
