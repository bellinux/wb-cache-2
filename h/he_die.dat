5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry of Champagne had bequeathed the Counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald, should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|While {{wandering}} in the woods, Finn and Jake fall down two separate holes. Finn {{lands in the}} Kingdom of Huge, where he is greeted by its sovereign, King Huge. The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour. Meanwhile, Jake lands on the barge of a bear named Seven. According to Seven, the barge has been falling for years, and he warns Jake not to try and escape, lest <b>he</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E

5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, the Neon District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should <b>he</b> <b>die.</b> Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E

25|$|The {{authority}} of the vicar does not cease with the pope who appointed him. But should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> during a vacancy of the Holy See, the vicegerent assumed his functions as a quasi vicar capitular. Theoretically at least, the vicar may hold diocesan synods; he could also formerly grant a number of choir-benefices. Pope Leo XIII reserved this right in perpetuity to the pope.|$|E
25|$|In Paris Huygens had an {{important}} patron and correspondent in Jean-Baptiste Colbert. However, {{his relationship with the}} Academy was not always easy, and in 1670 Huygens, seriously ill, chose Francis Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London, should <b>he</b> <b>die.</b> Then the Franco-Dutch War took place (1672–8). England's part in it (1672–4) is thought to have damaged his relationship with the Royal Society. Robert Hooke for the Royal Society lacked the urbanity to handle the situation, in 1673.|$|E
25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would be willing to take different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E

25|$|On 2 January 2005, Time {{magazine}} quoted unnamed Vatican {{sources as}} saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the Financial Times gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7–1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified {{as one of the}} 100 most influential people in the world by Time. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books.|$|E
25|$|The Burley and Burnell estates in South Shropshire {{were closely}} entwined {{with those of}} Sir Richard Ludlow, a much more {{powerful}} landowner who had inherited eleven manors in Shropshire. For about a decade, until Ludlow's death late in 1390, Burley worked closely with {{him as one of}} his feoffees. For example, Burley was {{one of a group of}} feoffees whom Ludlow was licensed to appoint on 20 January 1383 in relation to lands at Hodnet and elsewhere, the aim being to ensure they passed to John Ludlow, Richard's brother, should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> sine prole, as he actually did. As a feoffee Burley exercised many of Ludlow's responsibilities and powers on his behalf. The register of Joh Gilbert, the Bishop of Hereford, shows that Burley jointly exercised the advowson of the church at Wistanstow, presenting Edmund de Ludlowe as rector on 6 August 1385.|$|E
25|$|She was the {{daughter}} and sole heiress of John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (1403–1444), KG (a grandson of King Edward III through his third surviving son, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster by Katherine Swynford (later his wife)). Margaret was born at Bletsoe Castle, Bedfordshire, on 31 May 1441 or 1443. The day and month are not disputed, as she required Westminster Abbey to celebrate her birthday on 31 May. The year of her birth is more uncertain. William Dugdale, the 17th-century antiquary, suggested {{that she may have}} been born in 1441, based on evidence of inquisitions post mortem taken after the death of her father. Dugdale has been followed by a number of Margaret's biographers; however, {{it is more likely that}} she was born in 1443, as in May 1443 her father had negotiated with the king concerning the wardship of his unborn child should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> on campaign.|$|E

500|$|James {{was widely}} mourned. For all his flaws, he had largely {{retained}} the affection of his people, who had enjoyed uninterrupted peace and comparatively low taxation during the Jacobean era. [...] "As {{he lived in}} peace," [...] remarked the Earl of Kellie, [...] "so did <b>he</b> <b>die</b> in peace, and I pray God our king [...] may follow him". The earl prayed in vain: once in power, Charles and Buckingham sanctioned a series of reckless military expeditions that ended in humiliating failure. James had often neglected the business of government for leisure pastimes, such as the hunt; and his later dependence on favourites at a scandal-ridden court undermined the respected image of monarchy so carefully constructed by Elizabeth.|$|E
500|$|Gray's {{life was}} {{surrounded}} by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded {{a few days later}} by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh {{in the minds of the}} Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he [...] began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter into a sort of rebirth cycle or, should <b>he</b> <b>die,</b> if there would be anyone to remember him. Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering.|$|E
500|$|Robert married Elizabeth Mure around 1348, legitimising {{his four}} sons and five daughters. [...] His {{subsequent}} marriage to Euphemia de Ross in 1355 produced {{two sons and}} two surviving daughters and provided {{the basis of a}} future dispute regarding the line of succession. [...] Robert joined a rebellion against David in 1363 but submitted to him following a threat to his right of succession. [...] In 1364, David presented a proposal to Parliament that would cancel the remaining ransom debt if it was agreed that a Plantagenet heir would inherit the Scottish throne should <b>he</b> <b>die</b> without issue. [...] This was rejected and Robert succeeded to the throne at the age of 55 following David's unexpected death in 1371. [...] England still controlled large sectors in the Lothians and in the border country so King Robert allowed his southern earls to engage in actions in the English zones to regain their territories, halted trade with England and renewed treaties with France. [...] By 1384, the Scots had re-taken most of the occupied lands, but following the commencement of Anglo-French peace talks, Robert was reluctant to commit Scotland to all-out war and obtained Scotland's inclusion in the peace treaty. [...] Robert's peace strategy was a factor in the virtual coup in 1384 when he lost control of the country, first to his eldest son, John, Earl of Carrick, afterwards King Robert III, and then from 1388 to John's younger brother, Robert, Earl of Fife, afterwards the first Duke of Albany. [...] Robert II died in Dundonald Castle in 1390 and was buried at Scone Abbey.|$|E

500|$|Gerstmann noted [...] "a raw {{collection}} of messy operations", while Edge praised the game's [...] "inventiveness" [...] - saying it [...] "makes Soviet Strike" [...] - {{as well as}} the variety added by the games artificial intelligence. The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level.

Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's [...] "worst problem". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had [...] "some reservations" [...] about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was [...] "very playable and enjoyable", while another reviewer called it [...] "a load of fun". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some [...] "minor flaws", saying the HUD [...] "smacks of 16-bit era graphics"; The game impressed Great Drakons reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing.
