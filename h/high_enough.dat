5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a <b>high</b> <b>enough</b> level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite <b>high</b> <b>enough.</b> And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be <b>high</b> <b>enough,</b> and humidity must be <b>high</b> <b>enough</b> for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting Lyme disease, ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the poling {{process of}} PZT ceramics, the poling {{temperature}} {{is a critical}} condition. When the poling temperature is too low, no matter how high is the poling field and how long is the poling time, the planar electromechanical coupling factor kp is lower. When the poling temperature is <b>higher</b> <b>enough,</b> the kp can reach to a saturated value with a lower poling field and short poling time. The variation of dielectric constant with the poling conditions {{is the same as}} that of planar electromechanical coupling factor. When poling with a low temperature, the dielectric constant after poling is lower than 1400. When poling with higher temperature, no matter how high is the poling field and how long is the poling time, the dielectric constant after poling is higher than 1500...|$|R

5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach <b>high</b> <b>enough</b> temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s.

30|$|In {{the case}} of ASTM 514 grade S steel sample, {{rod-like}} and laminar carbides {{were found in the}} microstructure of the slag. Note that since the evaporation temperature of the graphite is 4827  °C, which is very close to the temperature that is reached at the electrode tip in the order of 5000 – 8000  °C, whereby the graphite of the electrode will evaporate, generating a reduction atmosphere near the cutting zone. While this gas is partially removed by pressurized air, carbon-rich areas could occur on the surface. In addition, the molten steel can facilitate the graphite entry since the temperature is <b>higher</b> <b>enough</b> to maintain the liquid bath for a short time. This allows the mixture of gas enriched with the steel to be produced by a diffusion mechanism through the gas + liquid interface, allowing the precipitation of carbides.|$|R
