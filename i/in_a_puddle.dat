5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle</b> {{that has a}} perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ryan {{goes to the}} {{basement}} to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle</b> of water. Laura finds a file on her brother {{and those of other}} patients with bogyphobia (phobia of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is hallucinating. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle</b> of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, Thomas Gold {{proposed}} {{the theory that}} life first developed not {{on the surface of}} the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface. It is claimed that discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle</b> of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.|$|E

25|$|Soon enough {{she finds}} herself outside the Weylin {{plantation}} in a rainstorm, a very drunk Rufus lying face down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle.</b> She tries to drag {{him back to the}} house, then gets Nigel to help her carry him. Back at the house, an aged Weylin appoints Dana to nurse Rufus back to health under threat of her life. Suspecting Rufus has malaria and knowing she cannot help much, Dana feeds Rufus the aspirin she has packed to lower his fever. Rufus survives, but remains weak for weeks. Dana learns that Rufus and Alice have had three children and that only one, a boy named Joe, has survived, though Alice is pregnant again. Rufus had forced Alice to let the doctor bleed the other two when they had fallen ill, inadvertently killing them. Weylin has a heart attack and when Dana is unable to save his life, Rufus sends her to work in the corn fields as punishment. By the time Rufus repents his decision, she has collapsed from exhaustion and is being whipped. Rufus then appoints Dana as the caretaker of his ailing mother, Margaret. Now the master of the plantation, Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, Weylin's former concubine. When Dana grows angry with him for the sale, Rufus explains that his father left debts he must pay. He then convinces Dana to use her writing talent to stave off his other creditors, despite the fact that Dana abhors secretarial work, and once had a fight with Kevin about typing his manuscripts. Time passes and Alice gives birth to a girl, Hagar, who is Danaâ€™s direct ancestor. Alice confides to Dana that she plans to run away with her children as soon as possible, as she fears that she is forgetting to hate Rufus. Dana convinces Rufus to let her teach his son Joe and some of the slave children how to read. However, when a slave named Sam asks Dana if his younger siblings can join in on the lessons, Rufus sells him away as punishment for flirting with her. When Dana tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. Faced with her own powerlessness over Rufus, she retrieves the knife she has brought from home and slits her wrists in an effort to time travel.|$|E
500|$|The Loudest Engine {{was first}} issued in Australia in September 2011. The album {{received}} mostly favourable reviews from music critics, {{but it did}} receive its share of negative response as well.

40|$|A {{technique}} that will adequately describe the physical condition {{of water in}} the soil has long been desired by scientists. The method should include the effect of soluble materials on the osmotic pressure of the soil solution, and also the effect of surface force action between the soil and soil water. Parker (8) demonstrated that the freezing point was reduced in the presence of finely divided material. This suggested the possibility of using the cryoscopic procedure to measure the physical condition of water soil. More recently, the introduction of Thermistors for accurate temperature measurement have made it desirable to investigate in greater detail the freezing point of water in soil. The experimental work reported here deals with the freezing point of water in soil and its relation to soil moisture tension as determined on three soils <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddled</b> and unpuddled condition. Several freezing treatments were included in this study to investigate improvements in the freezing technique. The treatments were arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standard split plot experimental design.

After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

2500|$|The canal company {{experienced}} a steady {{increase in the}} cost of maintenance as the years passed. In June 1852, they were notified that unless they paid Â£832 (...) , in compensation, coal would be mined from beneath the dam of the old reservoir at Shipley. The outcome of this confrontation is not clearly documented. In 1854, rainfall was less than two thirds of the normal average, and the reservoirs ran dry. Consideration was given to providing other sources of water, and Â£595 was spent on constructing a small reservoir on Mapperley Brook, and on raising the banks of the old reservoirs at Shipley and Mapperley. Further problems arose from seepage, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>puddle</b> bank being constructed {{at the head of the}} canal between 1857 and 1866, and extensive puddling being carried out at Limekiln lock in 1866, which had little effect, since canal water was reputedly entering two mines there in 1867. The Derbyshire Assizes Court heard the claim for compensation in 1871, and ruled against the canal owners, who then faced a large bill for the work and another for compensating the mine owners. Closure of the canal was considered, but instead it was shut in September and October 1871 for the work to be done, and afterwards traffic improved briefly.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Besumer and his {{mistress}} Harriet Lowe were attacked {{in the early}} morning hours of June 27, 1918, in the quarters at the back of his grocery which was located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. [...] Lowe was hacked over the left ear, and found unconscious when police arrived at the scene.

The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in the bathroom of the apartment. [...] Besumer later stated to police that he had been sleeping when he was bashed with the hatchet. Almost immediately, police arrested potential suspect Lewis Oubicon, a then 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in Besumer's store just a week before the attacks. [...] No evidence existed which could have proved the man guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that Oubicon had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. [...] Shortly after the attempted murder Lowe stated that she remembered having been attacked by a mulatto man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disillusioned state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the couple's home. [...] Oubicon was later released as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crimes. [...] Media attention soon turned to Besumer himself, as a series of letters written in German, Russian, and Yiddish were discovered in a trunk at the man's home. [...] Police suspected that Besumer was a German spy, and government officials began a full investigation of his potential espionage. [...] Weeks later, after going in and out of consciousness, Harriet Lowe told police that she thought Besumer was in fact a German spy, which led to his immediate arrest. [...] Two days later Besumer was released, and two lead investigators of the case were demoted due to unacceptable police work. [...] Besumer was once again arrested in August 1918, after Harriet Lowe, who lay dying in Charity Hospital after a failed surgery, stated that it was he who had attacked her more than a month previously with his hatchet.
