5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding <b>inductor</b> <b>core,</b> increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|E

The mathematical model of energy and magnetic processes in core of inductors is obtained. The mathematical model is generalized to DC-DC and AC-AC converters, to most popular schemes of converters and to transfer, recuperation and idle modes. It is shown that the energy and magnetic processes in core of inductors are identical for DC-DC and AC-AC converters, for buck, boost, buck-boost and fly-back converters, and for transfer, recuperation and idle modes.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{need for}} smart and wearable electronic systems are driving new electronics technology paradigms in miniaturization, functionality and cost. The operating voltages and power levels for devices in these systems {{are becoming increasingly}} varied with increased diversity of devices to serve these heterogeneous functions. Power convertor technologies are incorporated into various parts of these systems to step-up or step-down battery voltages and currents to address these diverse needs. Hence, multiple power converters, each requiring several passive components, are used to create stable power-supplies. This is placing significant challenges in ultra-miniaturized and ultra-efficient power management technologies. A typical power convertor consists of magnetic components such as inductors perform the basic energy storage and delivery functions from the source to the load. These power components are still at microscale in lithography and milliscale in component size. They occupy a large volume fraction of the power circuitry. Power convertors therefore, are a major bottleneck to system miniaturization. There is, thus, a need for ultra-miniaturized and high-performance power inductors for scaling down such power convertors. The critical parameters governing the size and performance of power inductors are its inductance density and power handling capability. These parameters are limited by the magnetic properties of the present <b>inductor</b> <b>core</b> materials.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{generator}} is {{a device}} that converts solar radiation originated from the Sun into electrical energy. Power electronics are used to feed this electrical energy into the grid. In {{the design of a}} converter that is connected to the photovoltaic generator, {{it is important to know}} the maximum values of the generator output: Maximum output power, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage, which are dependent on the amount of incident radiation and the value of ambient temperature. Maximum value for short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage were found based on the year-round irradiation and temperature measurement data. In this thesis, two boost-power-stage converters were designed. Design of the first converter was based on the conventional method that was introduced in the literature. In that method, the inductor and semiconductors were sized by using current that was derived by dividing input power of the converter by input voltage. Value of the converter input power was calculated by multiplying the standard test condition output power of the selected photovoltaic generator by conventional sizing factor, which is the ratio of the converter nominal input power to the nominal output power of the photovoltaic generator. The second converter was designed by using the information about the real maximum output current of the selected photovoltaic generator, which is the short-circuit current. The converters were designed in such a way that both have the same amount of switching frequency input voltage ripple and equal ability to prevent the low frequency output voltage ripple from affecting the input voltage. Even if the converters are electrically similar, the conventional design method leads to higher input capacitance, larger <b>inductor</b> <b>core</b> size and more uneven temperature distribution of the power semiconductors at the maximum power point than the new design method.
