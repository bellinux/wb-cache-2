40|$|During {{preliminary}} {{vehicle design}} reviews, requests {{were made to}} change flight termination systems from an <b>electroless</b> <b>nickel</b> (<b>EN)</b> connector coating to a zinc-nickel (ZN) plating. The reason for these changes was due to a new NASA-STD- 6012 corrosion requirement where connectors must meet the performance requirement of 168 hr of exposure to salt spray. The specification for class F connectors, MIL-DTL- 38999, certifies the EN coating will meet a 48 -hr salt spray test, whereas the ZN is certified to meet a 168 -hr salt spray test. The ZN finish is a concern because Marshall Space Flight Center has no flight experience with ZN-finished connectors, and MSFC-STD- 3012 indicates that zinc and zinc alloys should not be used. The purpose of this test was to run a 168 -hr salt spray test to verify the electrical and mechanical integrity of the EN connectors and officially document the results.

On the EN surface, two different types of corrosion morphologies were observed. Specimens prepared with TU showed preferential attack along particle boundaries, while pitting corrosion was observed for specimens prepared either without a stabilizer or with MA. The latter deposits showed higher corrosion resistances due, in part, to the formation of a P-enriched layer on the surface. The poorer corrosion performance of EN specimens prepared with TU was attributed to the presence of the particle boundaries and the trace impurities adsorbed on, or included in, them. The key impurity was sulphur incorporated during formation of deposits in TU-stabilized baths. It was clearly shown that the corrosion behaviour of the EN specimens was predominantly influenced by the morphological and surface compositional aspects of the deposits.
