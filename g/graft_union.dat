25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed <b>graft</b> <b>union</b> is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E

40|$|Grafting is an {{established}} practice for asexual propagation in horticultural and agricultural crops. The study on <b>graft</b> <b>unions</b> has become {{of interest for}} horticulturists using proteomic and genomic techniques to observe transfer of genetic material and signal transduction pathways from root to shoot and shoot to root. Another reason to study the <b>graft</b> <b>unions</b> was potentially to observe resistance against abiotic stresses. Using physiological and proteomic analyses, we investigated <b>graft</b> <b>unions</b> (rootstock and scions) of tomato genotypes exposed to standard-normal (23 / 23 and 25 / 18 °C day/night) and high-low temperatures (30 / 15 °C day/night). <b>Graft</b> <b>unions</b> had varied responses to the diverse temperatures. High-low temperature, but not standard-normal temperature, induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{in the form of}} H 2 O 2 and O 2 - 1 in rootstock and scions. However, the expression of many cell protection molecules was also induced, including antioxidant enzymes and their immunoblots, which also show an increase in their activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The graft interfaces thus actively defend against stress by modifying their physiological and proteomic responses to establish a new cellular homeostasis. As a result, many proteins for cellular defense were regulated in <b>graft</b> <b>unions</b> under diverse temperature, in addition to the regulation of photosynthetic proteins, ion binding/transport proteins, and protein synthesis. Moreover, biomass, hardness, and vascular transport activity were evaluated to investigate the basic connectivity between rootstock and scions. Our study provides physiological evidence of the grafted plants' response to diverse temperature. Most notably, our study provides novel insight into the mechanisms used to adapt the diverse temperature in <b>graft</b> <b>unions</b> (rootstock/scion) ...|$|R

Rootstocks of Mahaleb cherry exhibit different symptoms from stocks of Colt, Mazzard, or Stockton Morello. When the scion is grafted onto Mahaleb, symptoms consistent with Phytophthora root rot can be seen. To distinguish between root rot and x-disease the wood under the bark at the <b>graft</b> <b>union</b> should be examined. If it is x-disease the wood at the union will have grooves and pits this causes a browning of the phloem and shows the cells in decline. This rapid decline is caused by the rootstock cells near the <b>graft</b> <b>union</b> dying in large quantities. Foliage begins to turn yellow and the curl upward and inward toward the leaf midrib. Trees infected with Mahaleb rootstock die by late summer or early the following year.|$|E

Formerly designated as Agrobacterium tumefaciens biovar 3, A. vitis, the bacterium that causes of the disease, only occurs on grape. A. vitis survives systemically in grapevines, and initiates infections at wound sites, such as those caused by freeze injuries. As a result, vineyards in climates with cold winters are prone to suffer extensive damage from crown gall.

40|$|Among {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} contents, the interaction {{residing in the}} Interdependence Theory {{is one of the}} important components of plants. To elucidate how grafting influences the flow of carbon from shoots to tree roots and nitrogen from the roots to the shoots two sets of tests were carried out that have targeted the dosage of soluble sugars (to emphasize the relative flow of carbon) and nitrogen content dosage around the <b>grafting</b> <b>union</b> area. After many laboratory analyses, we obtained average values that reflect the dynamics of soluble sugars content depending on grafting, namely: 24 % in the scion, 41 % into the union area and 35 % in the rootstock, in a ratio of about 1 : 1. 7 : 1. 4. In what concerns the total nitrogen content, we observed that the values are very similar between variants. Instead, somewhat higher nitrogen quantities (36 %) were obtained in the rootstocks compared to the union area (32 %) and scions (32 %) representing a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1. 1. Performing our experiments we found that the distribution of soluble sugars and nitrogen, in particular, in the <b>grafting</b> <b>union</b> area and the flow of photoassimilates and mineral elements, in general, for first year grafted trees depends not so much on the compatibility between scion and rootstock, but on grafting itself. Furthermore, we concluded that grafting itself is a barrier in photoassimilates and mineral elements flow in trees. </div...|$|R

50|$|Grafting - This {{involves}} {{removing the}} canopy {{and most of}} the trunk of an existing vine and replacing it with a cutting of a new vine that is sealed by a <b>graft</b> <b>union.</b> This technique, better known as head grafting, is a quick and relatively inexpensive means of quickly changing over a vineyard as the new cutting is {{able to take advantage of}} an existing root system and is usually able to start producing a crop by the next growing season.|$|E
5000|$|Compatibility of Scion and Stock: Because {{grafting}} {{involves the}} joining of vascular tissues between the scion and rootstock, plants lacking vascular cambium, such as monocots, cannot normally be grafted.

40|$|Background: Scaphoid nonunions remain {{controversial}} {{with regard}} to optimal management, especially for those located at the proximal third. In this study, the authors aim to assess the union rate, avascular proximal pole revascularization, and functional outcome of scaphoid nonunions managed with distal radius vascularized bone grafts. Methods: Thirty patients were treated with vascularized bone grafts between 1999 and 2003 and prospectively followed up. The average nonunion chronicity was 3. 3 years. Nine patients (30 percent) had avascular necrosis of the proximal pole, five had unsuccessful previous surgical procedures, and four had radioscaphoid arthritis (Lichtman type III). Twenty proximal third nonunions were managed with dorsal radius bone graft, whereas 10 waist nonunions had palmar <b>grafts.</b> <b>Union</b> was assessed clinically and radiologically and, in 67 percent of the patients, by means of magnetic resonance imaging. Results: All cases were united by 12 weeks, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that all necrotic proximal poles were revascularized. On at least 24 months' follow-up, 90 percent of patients achieved complete pain relief. Wrist flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation arcs did not change. The postoperative grip strength was 82 percent of the contralateral side. The Mayo Modified Wrist Score increased significantly from 58 to 85 points and, overall, 77 percent of patients had an excellent or good outcome. No risk factors for compromised wrist function were identified. The scapholunate angle, the scaphoid length, and the Nattrass index improved significantly. Conclusions: This series demonstrates the efficacy of distal radius vascularized bone <b>grafts</b> in <b>union</b> enhancement, proximal pole revascularization, pain relief, improved wrist function, and carpal alignment.

40|$|Grafting {{has been}} used in {{agriculture}} for over two thousand years. With modern advances in biotechnology, new options for utilizing this proven horticultural technique are emerging. Specifically, trans-grafting, the combination of a genetically engineered (GE) rootstock with a wild-type (WT) scion, has the potential to provide biotic and abiotic stress tolerance or to increase plant vigor and productivity. Yet, it is unclear whether nucleic acids and proteins will be transmitted across a graft and, if so, whether this movement may affect the efficacy of the trans-grafting approach and/or regulatory oversight of the WT scion and its products.

Microscopical examination showed that callus forma-tion was more rapid in heated grafts than in controls, although callus formation occurred in all control grafts examined. Heat also induced cambial reactivation and tracheid formation, particularly in the vicinity of needle or bud traces in the scion.

To address this question, four rootstock-scion combinations, originating from three commercial nurseries in the Wellington area of the Western Cape Province of South Africa were investigated during the 1999 / 2000 season. The first isolations were made in September from callused cuttings prior to planting in nurseries. After planting, asymptomatic rooted cuttings were selected from nurseries after 3, 6 and 9 months. Isolations were made from the roots, rootstock, <b>grafting</b> <b>union</b> and scion.
