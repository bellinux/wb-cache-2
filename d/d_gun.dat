5000|$|The Syracuse Arms Company was {{incorporated}} in 1893 and commenced {{production of a}} double barrel shotgun named [...] "The Hollenbeck" [...] after its inventor Frank A. Hollenbeck. Frank Hollenbeck resigned from the Syracuse Arms Company in July, 1895; and in 1896, the gun was renamed [...] "The Syracuse" [...] which name remained unchanged from that point {{through the end of}} production. The Syracuse Arms company only manufactured double shotguns; and only hammerless shotguns until late 1904. Syracuse Arms Company produced hammerless model double guns in a variety of grades as follows: Grade 00, Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade A, Grade A-1 Special Trap, Grade B, Grade C, and Grade D; with the Grade <b>D</b> <b>gun</b> being their highest grade and retailing at $475.00 in 1904. Hammerless model Syracuse guns were produced in 10, 12, 16 (in 1901), and 20 (in 1902) gauges. The hammer model Syracuse gun was only offered in one grade and one gauge (12-bore) with a retail of $24.00. The Syracuse Arms Company was sold to Simmons Hardware Company of St. Louis, MO in April 1905; and although some additional guns were produced afterwards and sold through the sporting goods department of Simmons Hardware, no advertising materials promoting the Syracuse Gun have been located after April, 1905. Syracuse hammerless guns begin at serial number 1 and have been observed into the 39XXX serial number range. Some Syracuse hammerless guns were sold under a [...] "Trade Name" [...] called [...] "New Era", which name was also placed on some hammerless double guns produced by the Baker Gun Company, which is often a source of confusion; but all Syracuse [...] "Trade Name" [...] guns will fall within the above noted 1-39XXX serial number range. Syracuse hammer guns were assigned a separate serial number sequence containing a letter prefix beginning at [...] "H1" [...] and continuing numerically up through perhaps H2XXX. The Syracuse hammer gun was the only Syracuse model never cataloged; although the 1904 Syracuse pocket catalog does contain a folding insert devoted solely to the Syracuse hammer gun.|$|E

40|$|Since 2 February 1990 {{the pace}} of change in South Africa has been {{accelerating}} on all fronts. One naturally thinks of political development,but this change applies equally to economic development in the black informal sector There is a need for national and local authorities as well as fo r the private sector {{to play a role in}} promoting informal business activities. Instead of legislating away the so-called problem, the reality of the economic situation in the informal sector should be recognised and managed in a supportive manner In a changing society high priority should be given to the nurturing of economic growth in the informal sector. The increasing numbers of the unemployed in South Africa, especially in urban areas, necessitates positive steps to deal with the realities of urbanisation and to ease the way in which honest income can be earned through various opportunities in the informal sector A healthy and growing small business in the informal sector is a vital ingredient to ensure widespread employment and income-creation in a market-orientated economy. This sector of the economy tends to be labour-intensive, is competitive by nature and is noted for the ease of entry - thus being a prime training <b>gun</b> <b>d</b> for entrepreneurship. It is absolutely clear that the growing debate surrounding the informal sector in South Africa should be coupled with the application of reformist development strategies throughout the sub-continent. It order to improve the current situation, some specific strategies to achieve social and economic upliftment in the informal part of the economy are identified by the author. Although the informal sector forms an integral part of the economy as a whole, the focal point of this article is the economic role and function of the black population in the informal sector...|$|R
40|$|DNA immunization, {{inoculation}} with an antigen-expressing plasmid DNA, is a {{new method}} for generating an antigen-specific immune response. At the time these investigations began, very little was known about the immune response produced by DNA vaccines. Thus, the first aim of our studies was to perform a detailed examination of the antibody response generated by DNA immunization with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) -expressing DNA in BALB/c mice. Using several different routes and methods of DNA immunization, we observed a number of findings. Although all three forms of DNA immunization elicited strong anti-HA antibody responses, i. m. and i. d. saline DNA immunization required approximately 100 times more DNA than a gene gun DNA immunization to raise an equivalent titer of anti-HA antibody. Indeed, as little as one inoculation and one boost by gene gun of 0. 0004 μg of DNA produced a measurable antibody response in 50 % of mice. Unexpectedly, we found the isotype of the antibody response differed among groups of mice immunized by different forms of DNA immunization. Intramuscular and i. d. saline DNA immunization produced predominantly an IgG 2 a anti-HA antibody response, whereas gene gun DNA immunization elicited mostly an IgG 1 anti-HA antibody response. Considering that IgG 2 a and IgG 1 antibody isotypes were known to correlate with Th 1 and Th 2 immune responses, respectively, we analyzed the type of immune responses produced by i. m., i. <b>d.,</b> and gene <b>gun</b> DNA immunization. We found that i. m. and i. d. saline DNA immunization produced a Th 1 predominant cellular immune response. In contrast, gene gun DNA immunization produced a Th 2 cellular immune response. The differences {{in the type of}} immune responses were found to be due to the method of DNA immunization, and not due to the route of DNA inoculation. A gene gun DNA immunization of muscle produced the same IgG 1, Th 2 immune response as a gene gun DNA immunization of skin, while a saline DNA immunization of muscle and skin produced mostly an IgG 2 a, Th 1 immune response. Each method of DNA immunization created good memory Th cell responses. The type of immune response created by an initial DNA immunization remained fixed even after multiple boosts with the identical method of DNA immunization, following a boost with the alternative method of DNA immunization, or after a viral challenge. The differentiation of naive Th cells into Th 1 or Th 2 cells depends on a variety of factors. We performed many experiments to elucidate which factors {{played a role in the}} generation of Th 1 or Th 2 immune responses following saline DNA immunization and gene gun DNA immunization. DNA dose response studies revealed the use of different doses of DNA between groups of saline DNA and gene gun DNA immunized mice did not account for the differentiation of distinct Th cell subsets. Cytokine production inducible by a number of factors inherently associated with either saline DNA or gene gun DNA immunization did not affect Th differentiation. For instance, contamination of plasmid DNA with lipopolysaccharide did not account for differences in the immune response. Immunostimulatory CpG sequences did not affect Th differentiation following DNA immunization, but they did enhance the IgG 2 a antibody response to coinoculated HA protein. Finally, cotransfection of IFNγ or IL- 4 expressing plasmids with an HA-expressing plasmid by gene gun inoculation or as a saline DNA injection did not shift the type of immune response in a Th 1 or Th 2 direction, respectively. Thus, it appeared that increased cytokine stimulation was not responsible for selective Th subset differentiation. One factor related to the method of DNA immunization did seem to correlate with Th 1 differentiation. Deposition of plasmid DNA extracellulary by saline DNA injections (as opposed to intracellular DNA delivery by gene gun) may have stimulated Th 1 immune responses. Manipulating a gene gun DNA immunization to deliver DNA to the dermis (and thus extracellularly) shifted the immune response from that of a Th 2 type to a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 type. Furthermore, evidence was gathered demonstrating that pDNA can interact with cell surface molecules and that specific sequences in pDNA can act as a ligand and bind to molecules. Taken together, our data led us to propose a new model for Th 1 differentiation following saline DNA immunization. We believe extracellular pDNA binds to an APC cell surface molecule which activates the cell. The activated APC preferentially stimulates naive Th cells to differentiate into Th 1 cells. Finally, studies using a variety of mice differing in their genetic backgound and MHC genotype demonstrated the generality of our findings regarding i. m. saline DNA inoculations of an HA-expressing pDNA. Saline DNA immunization produced IgG 2 a, Th 1 -predominant immune responses independent of the genetic background and MHC genotype of the mice. In contrast, the type of immune response elicited by a gene gun DNA immunization was dependent on the MHC genotype of mice. Thus the type of immune response produced by gene gun DNA immunization probably depends on the specific antigen (and its effect on MHC-peptide/TcR interaction and signaling) and is less likely due to any inherent feature associated with the process of gene gun DNA delivery...|$|R

40|$|We {{already know}} that gun {{violence}} exacts enormous costs. The fear of gun violence, and people's perceived risk, {{has been shown to}} impose heavy social, psychological, and monetary burdens on individuals that translate into monetary costs to society. We also know the health care costs of treating gunshot injuries: just under $ 630 million i n 2010 (Howell and Abraham 2013). American society collectively pays all these costs. Yet we know comparatively little about the relationship between gun violence and the economic health of neighborhoods at the most grassroots levels; we don't know how businesses, jobs, and many more indicators of economic health respond to increased levels of gun violence. Could gun violence cause economic downturns? In communities and neighborhoods most affected by gun violence, does the presence of gun violence hold back business growth? To answer these important research questions at the neighborhood level, we assemble <b>d</b> <b>gun</b> violence and establishment data at the census tract level in six US cities. This report presents the initial findings of an in - depth analysis of the relationship bet ween gun violence and local economic health in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California; and Washington, DC.
