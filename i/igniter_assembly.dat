5000|$|It was a fin-stabilized field {{artillery}} rocket that followed a ballistic trajectory to ground targets. The rocket XM51 {{consisted of a}} warhead, a rocket motor assembly, and an <b>igniter</b> <b>assembly.</b> The components were shipped in separate containers and assembled by the user.|$|E
5000|$|The xenon-type Super Troupers had {{utilized}} {{a larger}} [...] "AC" [...] <b>igniter</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{which had been}} specially designed to function with the original high-reactance power supplies. As suggested by the name however, Super Troupers were intended for portability and [...] "trouping" [...] and the bulky two hundred pound (90 kg) plus power supplies were not conducive to travel environments.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report period was to continue {{the development of the}} Gas Generator design, fabrication and test of the non-polluting unique power turbine drive Gas Generator. Focus during this past report period has been to continue completion the Gas Generator design, completing the brazing and bonding experiments to determine the best method and materials necessary to fabricate the Gas Generator hardware, continuing to making preparations for fabricating and testing this Gas Generator and commencing with the fabrication of the Gas Generator hardware and ancillary hardware. Designs have been completed sufficiently such that Long Lead Items [LLI] have been ordered and upon arrival will be readied for the fabrication process. The keys to this design are the platelet construction of the injectors that precisely measures/meters the flow of the propellants and water all throughout the steam generating process and the CES patented gas generating cycle. The <b>Igniter</b> <b>Assembly</b> injector platelets fabrication process has been completed and bonded to the <b>Igniter</b> <b>Assembly</b> and final machined. The <b>Igniter</b> <b>Assembly</b> is in final assembly and is being readied for testing in the October 2001 time frame. Test Plan dated August 2001, was revised and finalized, replacing Test Plan dated May 2001...|$|E
5000|$|IM (1943-1944): A {{mixture of}} Gasoline and an {{incendiary}} compound thickener. It was ignited with an M3 fuze {{attached to the}} bottle with a Timmerman strap safety. The M3 <b>Igniter</b> fuze <b>assembly</b> consisted of a fuze body, a striker, and a [...]38-caliber Blank cartridge. The Timmerman Strap was a metal band under tension around {{the surface of the}} grenade that was hooked up to a striker safety in the fuse body. (If the bottle broke prematurely, the Timmerman strap safety would prevent the striker from going off on impact.) The user pulled the safety pin from the fuse assembly and threw the bottle against the target. When the bottle broke, the Timmerman strap fell off, deactivating the strap safety and allowing the striker to engage. The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The blank cartridge set off a flash, which ignited the liquid filler.|$|R
5000|$|The M116/A1 is not {{technically}} a stun grenade, but {{is in fact}} a hand grenade simulator, designed to create a realistic but not dangerous grenade-like effect for exercises. The M116 series is usually fitted with a pull string <b>igniter</b> and fuze <b>assembly.</b> An improvised stun grenade was created from the M116 series by US Navy SEALs, by replacing this fuze with an M201 series igniting fuze. This new weapon was nicknamed the [...] "Flash-Crash". There are certain dangers from using the M116-based Flash-Crash however, mainly the metal body, from which potentially dangerous fragments may break when employing the device in hostage rescue situations.|$|R
5000|$|Models with IM filler (Gasoline {{mixed with}} an {{incendiary}} thickener) or NP filler (a mixture {{of gasoline and}} Naphtha Palmate) were fuzed with an M3 Igniter fuze attached to the bottle with a Timmerman strap safety. The M3 <b>Igniter</b> fuze <b>assembly</b> consisted of a fuze body, a striker, and a [...]38-caliber Blank cartridge. The Timmerman Strap was a metal band under tension around {{the surface of the}} grenade that was hooked up to a striker safety in the fuse body. (If the bottle broke prematurely, the Timmerman strap safety would prevent the striker from going off on impact.) To activate the grenade, the user pulled the safety pin from the fuse assembly. He then threw the bottle against the target hard enough to shatter the glass. When the bottle broke, the Timmerman strap fell off, deactivating the strap safety and allowing the striker to engage. The fuze spring in the fuze body activated the striker, which struck the cartridge. The blank cartridge set off a pyrotechnic flash, which ignited the thickened gasoline filler.|$|R
40|$|A {{lightweight}} pyrogen <b>igniter</b> <b>assembly</b> {{including an}} elongated molded plastic tube adapted {{to contain a}} pyrogen charge was designed for insertion into a rocket motor casing for ignition of the rocket motor charge. A molded plastic closure cap provided for the elongated tube includes an ignition charge for igniting the pyrogen charge and an electrically actuated ignition squib for igniting the ignition charge. The ignition charge is contained within {{a portion of the}} closure cap, and it is retained therein by a noncorrosive ignition pellet retainer or screen which is adapted to rest on a shoulder of the elongated tube when the closure cap and tube are assembled together. A circumferentially disposed metal ring is provided along the external circumference of the closure cap and is molded or captured within the plastic cap in the molding process to provide, along with O-ring seals, a leakproof rotary joint...|$|E
40|$|IMP 11 was {{launched}} on October 3, 1964 from Cape Kennedy, Florida, by the Delta 26 Launch vehicle. The apogee achieved w a s 51, 600 n. m., which was l e s s {{than one-half of}} the planned altitude. This problem was attributed to the suspected failure of the <b>igniter</b> <b>assembly</b> of the third-stage motor, occurring after about 16 seconds of normal burning. The angle between the spacecraft spin-axis and the ecliptic plane was reduced by the third-stage malfunction, resulting in {{a wider range of}} incident sun-angles during the satellite lifetime. This caused low power output from the solar paddles and over-heating of the silver-cadmium battery. Spacecraft performance was satisfactory until the + 50 "C tempera-ture environment (about two months after launch) caused the failure of the battery. Thereafter, the spacecraft operated only during periods of favorable incident sun-angles. In all, about five months of useful data was recorded. A s of mid- 1965, the spacecraft was operating intermit-tently with essentially no useful data being obtained. There is some possibility that perhaps as much as a month's more data might be'ob-tained in the future. ii r-...|$|E
40|$|NASA's Global Exploration Strategy {{requires}} safe, reliable, robust, efficient {{transportation to}} support sustainable operations from Earth to orbit {{and into the}} far reaches of the solar system. NASA selected the Ares I crew launch vehicle and the Ares V cargo launch vehicle to provide that transportation. Guiding principles in creating the architecture represented by the Ares vehicles were the maximum use of heritage hardware and legacy knowledge, particularly Space Shuttle assets, and commonality between the Ares vehicles where possible to streamline the hardware development approach and reduce programmatic, technical, and budget risks. The J- 2 X exemplifies those goals. It was selected by the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) as the upper stage propulsion for the Ares I Upper Stage and the Ares V Earth Departure Stage (EDS). The J- 2 X is an evolved version ofthe historic J- 2 engine that successfully powered the second stage of the Saturn I launch vehicle and the second and third stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The Constellation architecture, however, requires performance greater than its predecessor. The new architecture calls for larger payloads delivered to the Moon and demands greater loss of mission reliability and numerous other requirements associated with human rating that were not applied to the original J- 2. As a result, the J- 2 X must operate at much higher temperatures, pressures, and flow rates than the heritage J- 2, making it one of the highest performing gas generator cycle engines ever built, approaching the efficiency of more complex stage combustion engines. Development is focused on early risk mitigation, component and subassembly test, and engine system test. The development plans include testing engine components, including the subscale injector, main <b>igniter,</b> powerpack <b>assembly</b> (turbopumps, gas generator and associated ducting and structural mounts), full-scale gas generator, valves, and control software with hardware-in-the-loop. Testing expanded in 2007, accompanied by the refinement of the design through several key milestones. This paper discusses those 2007 tests and milestones, as well as updates key developments in 2008...|$|R
