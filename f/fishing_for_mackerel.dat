60|$|From hence {{we went on}} to Bridport, {{a pretty}} large {{corporation}} town on the sea-shore, though without a harbour. Here we saw boats all the way on the shore, <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> <b>mackerel,</b> which they take in the easiest manner imaginable; for they fix {{one end of the}} net to a pole set deep into the sand, then, the net being in a boat, they row right out into the water some length, then turn and row parallel with the shore, veering out the net all the while, till they have let go all the net, except the line at the end, and then the boat rows on shore, when the men, hauling the net to the shore at both ends, bring to shore with it such fish as they surrounded in the little way they rowed. This, at that time, proved to be an incredible number, insomuch that the men could hardly draw them on shore. As soon as the boats had brought their fish on shore we observed a guard or watch placed on the shore in several places, who, we found, had their eye, not on the fishermen, but on the country people who came down to the shore to buy their fish; and very sharp we found they were, and some that came with small carts were obliged to go back empty without any fish. When we came to inquire into the particulars of this, we found that these were officers placed on the shore by the justices and magistrates of the towns about, who were ordered to prevent the country farmers buying the mackerel to dung their land with them, which was thought to be dangerous as to infection. In short, such was the plenty of fish that year that the mackerel, the finest and largest I ever saw, were sold at the seaside a hundred for a penny.|$|E

The larger fishing trawlers operate from Milford Haven, which was recognised by Lord Nelson as [...] "one of the greatest natural harbours in the world". In 1890, there were 1,660 fishing vessels using Milford Haven's docks and it became one of Britain's most successful fishing ports. However, Milford Haven became less busy after World War II, although in 1950 its trawlers still landed about 5-6% of the UK's wet fish (chiefly European hake) and had the UK's fifth largest fleet.Milford Haven now acts mainly {{as a base for}} foreign-registered trawlers which export most of their catch to continental markets. The trawlers and small fishing craft bring prosperity to Milford Haven and exploit the hake-fishery of the west coast and south-west of Ireland, with herring being landed in season. Prime fish landed at the port includes common sole, turbot, plaice, monkfish and European seabass, which fetch high prices. The smaller trawlers catch crab, lobster, crayfish, herring, whiting, pollack and salmon, or line <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>mackerel.</b> The old <b>fish</b> market at Milford Haven docks has closed but a smaller, trade only, market has opened instead.

When first hooked they would come up very readily, in fact they seemed to swim upward until near the surface when they would become alarmed and dart back and forth in their efforts to free themselves. The sport was very exciting. During 4 hours fishing 9 persons with 26 lines took 585 fish... And as our ship was out of fresh meat of every kind, all these fish were soon eaten by the officers and crew.|$|R
40|$|Rising ocean {{temperatures}} are causing marine fish species to shift spatial distributions and ranges, and are altering predator-prey dynamics in food webs. Most documented cases of species shifts so far involve relatively small species at lower trophic levels, and consider individual species in ecological isolation from others. Here, {{we show that}} a large highly migratory top predator fish species has entered a high latitude subpolar area beyond its usual range. Bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus Linnaeus 1758, were captured in waters east of Greenland (65 °N) in August 2012 during exploratory <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> Atlantic <b>mackerel,</b> Scomber scombrus Linnaeus 1758. The bluefin tuna were captured in a single net-haul in 9 – 11 °C water together with 6 tonnes of mackerel, which is a preferred prey species and itself a new immigrant to the area. Regional temperatures in August 2012 were historically high and contributed to a warming trend since 1985, when temperatures began to rise. The presence of bluefin tuna in this region is likely due {{to a combination of}} warm temperatures that are physiologically more tolerable and immigration of an important prey species to the region. We conclude that a cascade of climate change impacts is restructuring the food web in east Greenland waters...|$|R

The WGMHSA assessment of the North-East Atlantic mackerel is currently dependent on a single fishery independent estimate of biomass, derived from the ICES Triennial Mackerel and Horse Mackerel Egg Surveys. This is only available once every three years and makes the assessment increasingly insecure with elapsed time since the last survey. However, the various annual research surveys by different countries have verified that there is an even wider distribution of mackerel than that indicated by the commercial fisheries. All surveys have the potential to deliver information on the distribution and abundance of mackerel. However, the surveys cover only part of the known distribution area and consequently {{have not been able to}} deliver a valid stock estimate or complete distribution map. The Planning Group on Aerial and Acoustic Surveys <b>for</b> <b>Mackerel</b> (PGAAM) was established during the WGMHSA meeting in September 2001 with the main purpose of coordinating a number of surveys on pelagic species that can provide the information on the distribution and abundance of mackerel (Section 1, 5, 6, 7, 8). The main objectives of PGAAM are to provide the distribution of mackerel and biomass/ number indices that may be used by WGMHSA in future assessments. Furthermore, it aims to collate information on the hydrographic and plankton conditions of the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters to describe how feeding and migration of mackerel are influenced by this. The PGAAM met to coordinate vessels from appropriate countries which can collaborate with the Russian aerial surveys in the Norwegian Sea (Section 5), to coordinate Scottish and Norwegian acoustic surveys in the Viking Bank area (Section 6), to coordinate Spanish, Portuguese and French acoustic surveys (Section 7). Mackerel do not possess a swim bladder. As a result, they are poor reflectors of sound and have a low target strength (TS), so it’s very difficult to use the acoustic assessment. The PGAAM has tried to utilize the findings of the EU SIMFAMI project to provide tools to identify mackerel echo-traces (Section 2, 3) as well as to develop protocols and criteria to ensure standardisation of all sampling tools and survey gears (Section 4). The PGAAM made a list of the surveys in the North-East Atlantic not targeted at mackerel, but with the potential of collecting mackerel data to provide indices of mackerel abundance. Some surveys followed the PGAAM recommendations and collected data, and passed them to PGAAM (Section 8). Norway has surveyed the mackerel acoustically during the autumn for the last six years and PGAAM recommends that WGHMSA consider the use of these data as a relative index in the assessment as well the joint Scottish and Norwegian autumn surveys on mackerel. The Russian and Norwegian summer surveys should also be considered as tuning indices for the assessment of the mackerel stock (Section 5, 6, 10). Commencing from 2004, the ICES advice has changed in several aspects as well as the approach to the investigations. A new Ecosystem-based approach to the fishery advice/ management has begun. Near collaboration between the various surveys and descriptions of the ecosystem as a whole (including most of the marine exploration aspects) are requested today.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that observed spatial variation in mackerel fisheries, extending over several hundreds of kilometers, is reflective of climate-driven changes in mackerel migration patterns. Previous studies have been unable to clearly demonstrate this link. In this paper we demonstrate correlation between temperature and mackerel migration/distribution as proxied by mackerel catch data from both scientific bottom trawl surveys and commercial fisheries. We show that mackerel aggregate and migrate distances of up to 500 km along the continental shelf edge from mid-November to early March. The path of this migration coincides with the location of the relatively warm shelf edge current and, as a consequence of this affinity, mackerel are guided towards the main spawning area in the south. Using a simulated time series of temperature of the shelf edge current we show that variations in the timing of the migration are significantly correlated to temperature fluctuations within the current. The proposed proxies <b>for</b> <b>mackerel</b> distribution were found to be significantly correlated. However, the correlations were weak and only significant during periods without substantial legislative or technical developments.
