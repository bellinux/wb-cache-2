25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has fostered new information technology and business projects to attract new investment. The introduction of Burger King in Tórshavn was widely publicized {{as a sign of}} the globalization of Faroese culture. It remains to be seen whether these projects will succeed in broadening the islands' economic base. The islands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this should not necessarily be taken as a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries after leaving high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to fill newly developed positions on the Faroes. Nonetheless, in 2008 the Faroes were able to make a $52 million loan to Iceland to <b>help</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> country's banking woes.|$|E

50|$|Several other {{problems}} also damaged Portuguese {{support of their}} union with Spain.

40|$|It is {{essential}} to understand both the static and dynamic aspects of existing software for performance analysis.

Researchers in reverse engineering, however, have focused on identifying components and on static relationships. Efforts on performance engineering are being made to represent software behavior and simulate it. However, no one has tried to extract a simulated model from existing software automatically. We introduce SAAT, a tool developed at our research center. SAAT analyzes the dynamic aspects of software and creates a simulated model for performance analysis.
