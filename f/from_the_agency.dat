5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface pressures {{in the vicinity of}} the low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the watchful}} eye of police detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events tells the story of Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> to investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but a new piece of evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

He had a role in the Lee Frost-directed biker-exploitation film, Chrome and Hot Leather, a film about a group of Vietnam veterans taking on a bike gang. The film starred William Smith and Gaye played the part of Jim, one of the veterans.

25|$|On March 10, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that Spitzer had patronized a high-priced escort service called Emperors Club VIP and met {{for two hours}} with a $1,000-an-hour call girl. This information originally {{came to the attention}} of authorities from a federal wiretap. During a six month span, Spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> and paid more than $15,000. According to published reports, investigators alleged that Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was attorney general, and later as governor. Spitzer first drew the attention of federal investigators when his bank reported suspicious money transfers under the anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. The resulting investigation was triggered by the belief that Spitzer might have been hiding bribe proceeds and led to the discovery of the prostitution ring.|$|E

25|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process of}} a migrant domestic worker into Lebanon is conducted by sponsorship.

The invitation comes through a recruiting agency either by use of the services of {{their counterparts in the}} worker’s country of origin or directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> itself and sometimes at the request of an individual employer. First, the Ministry of Labour issues preliminary work authorization to migrant domestic workers. In 2010, the Ministry of Labour issued and approximate 118,000 work permits to migrant domestic Workers. Next, the Ministry of Interior issues entry visas through the General Directorate for General Security. Then the General Directorate of General Security authorizes the legal entry of migrant domestic workers and arranges work permission and residence when they arrived in the country. Lastly, the sponsor’s name is located on the migrant domestic worker's entry visa, residence and work permit. The visa is for a three-month period {{and the name of the}} sponsor is included in the passport. When the migrant domestic worker arrives at the airport they are subjected to an immigration routine which includes the handing over of their passports to the Lebanese General Security in order to process the papers, while the migrant domestic worker waits to be collected by their sponsor. After this, the sponsor brings the migrant domestic worker to a local agency for a basic medical checkup.|$|E
25|$|Mazzocchi {{became a}} {{national}} staffer in 1965. That year, long-time OCAW president O.A. Knight retired. Secretary-Treasurer Alvin F. Grospiron ran for president, and Mazzocchi strongly backed his candidacy. The election was a bitter one. Knight had allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to use the union as a cover for covert operations, and had accepted {{large sums of money}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> Because of his support for Gospiron, Mazzocchi was appointed OCAW's Citizenship-Legislative Director in 1965. He used his position to push strongly for health and safety language in union contracts, as well as for state and federal legislation on the issue. In 1969 and 1970, he organized a series of public meetings in which OCAW and other union members testified about the chemicals they were handling and the health problems they were having. Scientists also testified at these public hearings about the danger of these chemicals. The public meetings gained widespread press attention. Mazzocchi also used the hearings to help educate workers on the legislative process, and trained them to act as lobbyists for federal health and safety legislation. The media attention and pressure from union members provided critical support for congressional attempts to pass comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation. In December 1970, Congress enacted and President Richard Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Nixon specifically cited Mazzocchi's leadership and grassroots organizing efforts as key in winning passage of the Act.|$|E
