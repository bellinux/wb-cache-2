5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three <b>horizontal</b> <b>sections,</b> and architects {{considered}} the rivers and other natural characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the design}} of the dome is very {{different}} from that of the Pantheon and it is unclear what the influences were, it does share some similarities with earlier and smaller brick domes in Persia. The use of a herringbone pattern in the brick allowed for short <b>horizontal</b> <b>sections</b> of the layers of the dome to be completed as self-supporting units. Over 32 meters in height, it remains the largest masonry dome ever built. The dome can be described as a cloister vault, with the eight ribs at the angles concentrating weight on the supporting piers. The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer.|$|E

40|$|Setting T-bone {{structure}} in the enlarged <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway has a good effect on increasing the space for fish and the flow depth and on reducing the flow velocity in the fishway. The deposit of sediment in the fishway will affect the flow. In this paper we study the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway, for three kinds of slope, three kinds of discharges, and two kinds of outlet width for the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway, then discuss the flow depth, the flow velocity and the sediment after setting four kinds of T-bone structure. By analyzing the experiment data, we know when slope and discharge reduced, the flow velocity in the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway can reduce, and the sediment can be less. When the outlet width for the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway decreases, the flow velocity in the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway can reduce and the flow depth in the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway can increase, but the sediment in the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway would be more, although can reduce the flow velocity and increase the flow depth, but actually can occur blocks in the fishway. Setting T-bone {{structure in}} the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway has a more obvious effect on place which sediment deposit in the fishway. When the outlet width for the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway is 40 cm, and T-bone structure is B type, the sediment in the U-turn <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> of fishway will be least, so the fishway has no blockade. It is also expected that these findings can be employed as a reference in the similar design of engineering practice. 在魚道放寬水平段內設置丁骨構造物，確實能達到增加魚類棲息空間、提昇水深及減緩流速之目的，但砂石進入水平段內之淤砂情形則是影響魚道是否能暢通的主要原因；因此本研究針對魚道水平迴頭彎段之部份，在三種坡度、三種流量和兩種魚道水平迴頭彎段之出口寬度下，進行加砂試驗，並對架設四種不同丁骨構造物型態下之水深、流速及淤砂量加以探討。 經由試驗資料分析，坡度及流量愈小時，魚道水平迴頭彎段的流速會減緩，且魚道水平迴頭彎段淤砂量也會減少；魚道水平迴頭彎段出口寬度變小時，魚道水平迴頭彎段的流速會變小，且魚道水平迴頭彎段的水位會提升，但魚道水平迴頭彎段內的砂石量卻會增加，雖然能減緩流速且增加水深，但是卻會發生阻塞魚道的情形；在魚道水平迴頭彎段內設置丁骨構造物時，影響魚道水平迴頭彎段之砂石淤積位置較為明顯，當魚道水平迴頭彎段出口寬度為 40 cm，且丁骨構造物設置型態為B型時，其在魚道水平迴頭彎段的淤砂量最少，並不會有堵塞魚道的情形發生，希望此研究能對將來在魚道之內部設計方面有所幫助。第一章 前言	 1 第二章 前人研究	 3 2. 1 有關防砂壩對河川生態的影響及魚道效用之評估	 3 2. 2 有關魚道設計之研究	 5 2. 3 台灣魚類溯游特性之研究	 12 2. 4 有關丁壩設計之研究	 13 第三章 理論分析	 15 3. 1 消能方式	 15 3. 2 砂丘(Sand Dunes) 	 16 3. 3 丁壩(Spur Dikes) 	 16 第四章 渠槽試驗	 19 4. 1 試驗目的	 19 4. 2 試驗設備	 20 4. 3 試驗設計及條件	 26 4. 4 試驗步驟	 27 第五章 結果與討論	 29 5. 1 魚道水平段之淤砂情形探討	 30 5. 2 魚道水平段之流速情形探討	 44 5. 3 魚道水平段之水位情形探討	 51 第六章 結論與建議	 58 6. 1 結論	 58 6. 2 建議	 60 參考文獻	 61 附表、水平渠槽試驗流速及水位分析表	 6...|$|R

The layout of the motes and stargates are shown in Figure 1. The sections have been used from the Original Topology document[1]. The topology is meant to test a common configuration of the final demo with limited number of XSM motes we have available (a maximum of 185). The major features of this topology are as follows: • The only Thick <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will have 103 motes, the only Thin <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will have 21 motes, and the only Thin Vertical section will have 38 motes, bringing the total number of motes deployed to 162. • The interspacing between closest neighboring motes will continue to be 9 m (with few exceptions, as noted in Figure 1). The Thick <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will be 180 m long and 36 m wide. The Thin <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will be 180 m wide. The Thin Vertical section will be 340 m long. • The Thin Vertical Section runs through the middle of the Thin <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> to test the common configuration that these sections will share in the final demo. • The Thick <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will have three stargates, 90 m apart. The Thin <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section</b> will have one stargate situated in the middle, again to form the common configuration. In addition to sharing the only stargate of the Thin <b>Horizontal</b> <b>section,</b> the Thin Vertical section has another stargate at the bottom. This brings the total number of stargates deployed to 5. References...|$|R

Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, {{depending on whether}} a temple {{was built in the}} early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed [...] "horizontal treatment". The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and Puranic scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of yallis or makaras (imaginary beasts) and hamsas (swans).

The upper eaves projects about half a meter from the wall. There is a second eaves running about a meter below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers (aedicule) between them. The wall images of Hindu gods and goddesses and their attendants are below the lower eaves, and there are 120 such sculptured panels in all. Below these are six moldings of equal size with decorations in frieze. This according to historian Kamath is broadly called [...] "horizontal treatment". The six moldings {{at the base of}} the wall is divided into two sections.

2500|$|The XJ12 {{version was}} {{announced}} in July 1972, featuring simplified grille treatment, and powered by a 5.3L V12 engine (coupled to a Borg Warner Model 12). The car as presented {{at that time was}} the world's only mass-produced 12-cylinder four-door car, and, with a top speed [...] "around 140 mph" [...] (225km/h) as the [...] "fastest full four-seater available in the world today". Although it had been the manufacturer's intention from launch that the XJ would take the twelve-cylinder engine, its installation was nonetheless a tight fit, and providing adequate cooling had evidently been a challenge for the engineers designing the installation. [...] Bonnet/hood louvres such as those fitted on the recently introduced twelve-cylinder E Type were rejected, but the XJ12 featured a complex [...] "cross-flow" [...] radiator divided into two separated <b>horizontal</b> <b>sections</b> and supported with coolant feeder tanks at each end: [...] the engine fan was geared to rotate at 1¼ times the speed of the engine rpm, subject to a limiter which cut in at a (fan) speed of 1,700rpm. [...] The fuel system incorporated a relief valve that returned fuel to the tank when pressure in the leads to the carburetters exceeded 1.5 psi {{to reduce the risk of}} vapour locks occurring at the engine's high operating temperature, while the car's battery, unusually, benefited from its own thermostatically controlled cooling fan.|$|E

Relative drilling technology has developed rapidly in recent years in China. This article puts focus on the methodology of well plan, trajectory control and matched tools and application situation of drilling fluid and drilling equipment for long <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> well. Based on the analysis of drilling and completion technical difficulties, suitability of some well design methods such as catenary curve used to decline friction and torque have been discussed, and even more practical means proven in many designs have been recommended. After introducing the drilling capability of the long horizontal-section well, the article indicated some special characteristic of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> wells and difference from ERD wells.
