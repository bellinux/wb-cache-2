He {{would have been an}} {{excellent}} match for her, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him. She unselfishly does what others expect of her, <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t <b>doing</b> <b>things,</b> <b>like,</b> just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E
500|$|Other {{well-known}} review outlets, like Engadget, voiced {{their concerns}} over Apple [...] "by <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader {{and even the}} Function row, Apple seems to forgotten {{how many of us}} actually work". This goes unison with the wider blogosphere and review scene where foremost the touch bar was criticized for providing a negative impact on a user's concentration and usability: [...] "The cognitive footprint of direct second screen interactions is significantly higher than that of indirect interactions". Other items of critique were non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default. Responsible for this behaviour are the Co-Processor powering the touch bar and higher TDP of the stronger CPU models.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you." ...|$|E
500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|Romanek {{described}} {{working with}} child actors and [...] "knowing {{that the first}} act of the film {{was going to have}} to be carried by 12-year-olds" [...] as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said that most of the rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good. At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.|$|E

[...] Her parents supported her talent by enrolling her in painting classes and later private lessons in watercolor painting. By {{the time she was}} in college she was selling watercolor landscapes at art fairs. During slow times at the fairs she drew little cartoons of animals <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> playing golf or fishing. Customers snapped up the animal drawings, so that her work became more and more focused on the style that became Suzy's Zoo.|$|E
2500|$|On June 6, 2013, {{during the}} annual Konami Pre-E3 show, Konami {{confirmed}} that actor Kiefer Sutherland provided Snake's voice and performed motion capture {{work for the}} game, taking a role over voice actor David Hayter. Kojima's reason for replacing Hayter was to [...] "have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words", and that he [...] "needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities {{of a man in}} his late 40s". Hollywood producer and director Avi Arad suggested to Kojima that Sutherland could fulfill his requirements. Akio Ōtsuka was unaffected by this casting change and continued to voice Snake in the Japanese version. On March 4, 2015, Kojima revealed that Snake would have less dialogue in The Phantom Pain than previous installments. The reasoning behind it was to make Snake come across as an extension to the player and that he [...] "will act based on [...] rather than <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> making spontaneous comments or flirting with women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) is {{a quirky}} cashier at Corner Gas, and the self-professed smartest person in town. She {{was born on}} April 16, 1968 (as shown on her driver's license in the episode [...] "The Accidental Cleanist"). Wanda has a sardonic, caustic {{personality}} and enjoys lording her knowledge over others. She is the single mother of a 6-year-old son, Tanner Vincent Dollard, {{who has never been}} seen or heard on-screen. (It's implied that Hank is Tanner's father; when Wanda is approached about this, she tries to laugh it off, but doesn't deny it outright.) Tanner is portrayed as a living nightmare for prospective babysitters (Season 1, Episode 4) and is a handful for his own mother, <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> putting peanut butter up her nose while she sleeps. Accused of being a know-it-all, Wanda is also one of very few Dog River residents who has gone to university; she holds a degree in linguistics with a minor in comparative religion but took classes in many other subjects. Despite her extensive education, she considers her job at Corner Gas a privilege. She is shown as having a case of mild agoraphobia in one episode. Like Brent and Hank, Wanda grew up in Dog River. After the end of the series, she pursued a Ph.D. in theoretical physics though she still works at Corner Gas, albeit with a pay raise.|$|E
