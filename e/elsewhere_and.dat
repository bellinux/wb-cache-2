5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} <b>elsewhere</b> <b>and</b> he was a servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>and</b> the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved <b>elsewhere</b> <b>and</b> the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
5|$|Despite selling no advance {{copies in}} America, Summerhill brought Neill {{significant}} renown {{in the next}} decade, wherein he sold three million copies. The book was used in hundreds of college courses and translated into languages such as German. Reviewers noted Neill's charismatic personality, but doubted the project's general replicability <b>elsewhere</b> <b>and</b> its overstated generalizations. They put Neill in a lineage of experimental thought, but questioned his lasting contribution to psychology. The book begat an American Summerhillian following, cornered an education criticism market, and made Neill into a folk leader.|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed <b>elsewhere</b> <b>and</b> transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E

Scientific, mathematical or natural discoveries, changes in minor concepts of design or style and artistic innovations do not appear on the list.|$|E

In the armistice of 1611 the Commonwealth {{was able to keep}} the majority of the contested areas, as a variety of internal and foreign difficulties, including the inability to pay the mercenary soldiers and the Union's new involvement in Russia, precluded a comprehensive victory.|$|E

5|$|Local officials, the Selbstschutz, and the Hilfspolizei (Auxiliary Police) {{played a}} key role in {{rounding}} up and massacring Jewish Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. These groups helped the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units to quickly identify Jews. The Hilfspolizei, consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian Army and police officers, ex-Aizsargi, members of the Pērkonkrusts, and university students, assisted in the murder of Latvia's Jewish citizens. Similar units were created <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>and</b> provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} violence {{broke out}} in Martinsburg, West Virginia, between workers and militia guarding a train, prompting the governor of West Virginia {{to appeal to the}} President for aid.

Newspaper reports counted 400–500 men who had joined the rail strike, and in Martinsburg, 75 trains with 1,200 rail cars sat idle.|$|E
5|$|That same day, {{the four}} men present when the {{cylinder}} was opened (two of the scrap collectors and two scrapyard employees) began to feel ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting. The scrap collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart, and took the parts to sell at the scrapyard the next day. The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>and</b> had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E

5|$|The NPL did {{not have}} the {{expertise}} to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office's (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory.

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog survives {{in some areas}} of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the {{proposed}} site for the tennis courts for the 2000 Sydney Olympics).

5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred <b>elsewhere)</b> <b>and</b> grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E
