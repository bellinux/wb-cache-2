Whether caught or eaten after death or injury from other sources, stomach contents of great black-backed gulls usually show fish to be the primary food. On Sable Island in Nova Scotia, 25% of the stomach contents were comprised by fish but 96% of the regurgitations given to young was made up fish. Similarly, on Great Island in Newfoundland, 25% of the stomach contents were fish but 68% of regurgitants were fish. The most regularly reported fish eaten in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morrhua), Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Other prey often includes various squid, <b>Jonah</b> <b>crabs</b> (Cancer borealis), rock crabs (Cancer irroratus), sea urchins, green crabs (Carcinus maenas), starfish (Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens) and other echinoderms, crustaceans and mollusks when they come across the opportunity.

50|$|The device itself (or reader) weighs 2.2 {{pounds and}} is a {{combined}} spectrophotometer, heater and pump, operated with multiple interchangeable cartridges {{for the detection of}} different microbial molecules. There are three different LOCAD-PTS cartridges aboard the ISS, for the detection of three different microbial molecules: endotoxin, glucan and lipoteichoic acid. These three molecules are found mainly within gram-negative bacteria, fungi and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Endotoxin and glucan are detected with the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) enzyme cascade, derived from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. Lipoteichoic acid is detected with the Pro-Phenol Oxidase (PPO) enzyme cascade derived from the <b>Jonah</b> <b>crab,</b> Cancer borealis. By the amplification of a small signal, these enzyme cascades allow detection of very low amounts of starting microbial material.

The fertilised eggs were at first retained within the pyloric stomach of the female where the embryos underwent the first stages of their development. Later they emerged and the brachiolaria larvae were brooded underneath the arched disc of the starfish. The breeding season lasted about four months but it was unclear for how long any individual female brooded her young. While brooding, feeding either stopped or was restricted but a few brooding females were found to have prey items in their pyloric stomachs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Temperature changes {{influence}} the reaction rates of all biological processes, which can pose dramatic challenges to cold-blooded organisms, and {{the capability to}} adapt to temperature fluctuations is crucial {{for the survival of}} these animals. In order to understand the roles that neuropeptides play in the temperature stress response, we employed a mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate the neuropeptide changes associated with acute temperature elevation in three neural tissues from the <b>Jonah</b> <b>crab</b> Cancer borealis. At high temperature, members from two neuropeptide families, including RFamide and RYamide, were observed to be significantly reduced in one of the neuroendocrine structures, the pericardial organ, while several orcokinin peptides were detected to be decreased in another major neuroendocrine organ, the sinus gland. These results implicate that the observed neuropeptides may be involved with temperature perturbation response via hormonal regulation. Furthermore, a temperature stress marker peptide with the primary sequence of SFRRMGGKAQ (m/z 1137. 7) was detected and de novo sequenced in the circulating fluid (hemolymph) from animals under thermal perturbation...|$|E

However, two RFamide-family peptides and a truncated orcokinin peptide were mapped to locations distinct from other members of their respective families. Over 30 previously sequenced neuropeptides were identified based on mass measurement. For increased confidence of identification, select peptides were fragmented by postsource decay (PSD) and collisional-induced dissociation (CID).

Without their grazing, dense algal beds have {{developed}} and replaced the coralline “barren grounds ” in western Maine. Dense algal beds prohibit urchin recruitment because they harbor micropredators of newly settled sea urchins. We examined the hypothesis that adult urchins, relocated to an area {{where they had been}} depleted, could aid in population recovery by directly increasing grazing pressure and indirectly increasing urchin recruitment. In two separate trials (August 2000 and April/May 2001), we relocated 3000 adult urchins to each of 8 sites in 2000 and 9 sites in 2001 at Cape Elizabeth, Maine. In July 2001, relatively low fleshy algal cover (< 50 %) was quantified at plots with urchins.

We surveyed the vertical distribution of Carcinus, other crabs, and their potential prey from the intertidal into the shallow subtidal. Carcinus was most abundant in the intertidal and decreased in the subtidal. In contrast, a preferred prey of Carcinus, the mussel Mytilus edulis, had highest densities in the shallow subtidal. Why isn?t Carcinus most abundant where prey densities are highest? A previous experiment revealed a higher mortality rate for Carcinus tethered in the subtidal than in the intertidal.

40|$|The stomatogastric {{ganglion}} (STG) is {{an excellent}} model for studying cellular and network interactions because it contains {{a relatively small number}} of cells (approximately 25 in C. borealis) which are well characterized. The cells in the STG exhibit a broad range of outputs and are responsible for the motor actions of the stomach. The stomach contains the gastric mill which breaks down food with three internal teeth, and the pylorus which filters the food before it reaches the midgut. The STG produces two rhythmic outputs to control the gastric mill and pylorus known as central pattern generators (CPGs). Each cell in the STG can participate in one or both of these rhythms. These CPGs allow for the study of neuromodulation, homeostasis, cellular and network variability, network development, and network recovery. The dissection of the stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) from the <b>Jonah</b> <b>crab</b> (Cancer borealis) is done in two parts; the gross and fine dissection. In the gross dissection the entire stomach is dissected from the crab. During the fine dissection the STNS is extracted from the stomach using a dissection microscope and micro-dissection tools (see figure 1). The STNS includes the STG, the oesophageal ganglion (OG), and the commissural ganglia (CoG) as well as the nerves that innervate the stomach muscles.

40|$|In {{order to}} study {{neuromodulation}} in Cancer borealis, {{commonly known as}} the <b>Jonah</b> <b>crab,</b> we designed a microchip capillary electrophoretic (CE) device with micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) to separate bioamines and detect their concentrations using amperometric detection (AD). The analysis will be used to characterize the bioamines: dopamine, octopamine, tyramine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA). The device measures the concentration of bioamines in microdialysate samples taken directly from the pericardial cavity of the crab. The research on Jonah crabs will be applied to enhance our understanding of the crab neurology. Since the structure and in some instances, the function of the neuromodulators are conserved, this research may be applicable to human studies. Researchers who use our device will be able to detect nanomolar concentrations of bioamines. This will help them to better understand the nervous system of crabs. This could also lead {{to a better understanding of}} the human nervous system and how to treat and manage neurodegenerative diseases. In order to obtain data, the device incorporates carbon paste electrodes modiﬁed with carbon nanotubes, which literature suggests should be able to detect 50 nanomolar concentrations using amperometry. Moreover, the buffer solution includes sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles to separate two structural isomers of interest - octopamine and dopamine - by their difference in afﬁnity. Combining these methods and applying voltage across the long channel separates bioamines via electroosmotic ﬂow (EOF) based on their electrophoretic mobility. At the end of the CE channel there are electrodes to measure bioamine concentration via AD. An SU- 8 mold was prepared by standard lithography techniques. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels were formed from an SU- 8 mold through replica molding. Carbon paste electrodes were screen printed into the PDMS electrode channel. We observed electroosmotic ﬂow in CE by inserting ﬂuoroisothiocyanate (FITC) -dextran dye and applying high voltage. Electrodes were placed in channel near the outlet to electrochemically detect the concentration of each bioamine. The limit of detection (LOD) for carbon paste electrodes was observed to be 10 mM using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV).

40|$|Predators {{can have}} large effects on prey populations {{and on the}} {{structure}} and function of communities. In addition to direct consumption of prey, predators often cause prey to alter their foraging behavior, habitat selection, and morphology. These non-lethal effects of predators can propagate to multiple trophic levels and often exert equal or larger effects upon communities than those of direct consumption. For non-lethal predatory effects to occur, prey must detect and respond to predation risk. While the importance of information transfer in this process has been realized, few studies explore how prey responses are influenced by predator characteristics and environmental conditions that influence the transmission of cues indicative of predation risk. In this dissertation I investigate factors that influence how a single prey species evaluates and responds to predation risk. Here, I examined: 1) the type and nature of cues prey use to evaluate predator risk; 2) how predator identity, predator diet, and the relative risk of predators influence prey response to predation risk; 3) how hydrodynamic conditions influence the delivery of predator cues; 4) how biogeographic trends in predator distribution influence prey response to predation risk; and 5) how genetic structure might vary according to prey geographic location and habitat. To address these questions, I used a common intertidal model system consisting of the rocky intertidal whelk Nucella lapillus (Linnaeus, 1758) and a suite of its predators, the native rock crab Cancer irroratus (Say, 1817), <b>Jonah</b> <b>crab</b> Cancer borealis (Stimpson, 1859), and the invasive green crab Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758). Nucella use chemical cues emanating from their most common predator (Carcinus maenas) and crushed conspecifics to evaluate predation risk. Nucella from different habitats experience different levels of predation risk, and Nucella from habitats {{with high levels of}} predation had larger antipredatory responses to predator risk cues than Nucella that experienced less predation. These chemical cues indicative of predation risk are influenced by hydrodynamic conditions, and Nucella have the strongest anti-predatory response in flow velocities of u= ~ 4 - 8 cm s^- 1. Furthermore, Nucella from geographic regions where green crabs are historically absent did not elicit anti-predatory responses, while Nucella from regions where green crabs are common frequently responded. Findings from my dissertation research demonstrate that prey detection and response to predation risk is highly dependent upon predator identity, predator diet, environmental forces, and biogeographic patterns in predator and prey distributions...|$|E
