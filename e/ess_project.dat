40|$|The <b>ESS</b> Linac <b>project,</b> phase I, {{requires}} 12 {{long pulse}} klystron modulators with compact footprint, high pulse power and improved quality {{both on the}} output pulse waveform and on the input AC power line. Conventional long pulse modulators are typically based on HV pulse transformers and commonly exhibit poor efficiency, low power density, large footprint and cost, with still limited performance on pulse rise time, pulse flat-top accuracy and AC power line quality (flicker, current harmonic distortion, power factor). This paper presents the Stacked Multi-Level (SML) klystron modulator topology, a novel modular concept based on the association of several HV modules in series at their output, each formed by a high voltage and high-frequency transformer, a HV diode rectifier bridge and a low pass filter. Each HV module is fed from a low voltage power electronic inverter at ground potential since the transformer provides the required galvanic isolation between primary and secondary windings. This topology is believed to better suit the application and better satisfy ESS requirements, directly addressing the mentioned shortcomings of conventional topologies.

Such systems are designed with the aim of improving productivity, data accuracy, and the reduction of paperwork and administrative overheads. Moreover, unlike their conventional non-web-based predecessors, the WBIS are commonly aimed at users who are casual and untrained, geographically distributed and non-homogenous. The dissemination of WBIS necessitates additional infrastructure support {{in the form of a}} security system, workflow and transaction management, and web administration. WBIS are commonly developed using an evolutionary approach, whereby the version of the application, acquired from the vendor, is first deployed as a pilot, in order to gather feedback from the target users before the evolutionary cycles commence. While a number of web development methodologies have been proposed by existing research, there is a dearth of empirical evidence that elucidates the experiences of project initiators in pursuing the evolution of web services, a process that undoubtedly involves dealing with stakeholder issues. This research project presents a phenomenological investigation of the experiences of project managers with the implementation of web-based employee service systems (ESS), a domain that has witnessed a sharp growth in Australia in recent times. However, the project managers’ rich, multidimensional account of their experiences with the implementation of ESS revealed the social obstacles and fragility of intra-organizational relationships that demanded a cautious and tactful approach. Thus, the study provides a socio-organizational perspective to web projects in contrast to the functionalist paradigm of current web development methodologies. The research also confirms that consideration of the concerns of stakeholders by project managers is crucial to the successive cycles of <b>ESS</b> evolution. <b>Project</b> managers address stakeholder concerns by pursuing actions that are aimed at encouraging ESS usage, but at the same time, such actions can have consequences necessitating subsequent iterations of system enhancement and improvement.

40|$|Access to {{electricity}} {{is a key}} factor behind development and expansion of modern societies, and electric power systems are the backbone infrastructure for economic growth of nations and communities. However, {{more than a billion}} {{people all over the world}} have no or limited access to electricity and are deprived of basic services. Furthermore, there are many communities that rely on small-scale isolated microgrids to supply their electric power demands, and many challenges exist in keeping those microgrids operating. The cost of operating isolated microgrids is a major issue which impacts the availability of a proper power network in remote communities. Hence, many organizations, communities and governments around the world are looking into alternative options for electrification of remote communities by considering Renewable Energy (RE) resources, such as wind and solar power, and utilization of Energy Storage Systems (ESS). This thesis investigates the feasibility of RE deployment in remote communities, by proposing a generalized optimal planning platform and conducting comprehensive simulation studies based on real measured data, and evaluates the impact of economic, technical and operation constraints on the planning of an isolated microgrid involving conventional generation, RE resources and ESS. This work suggests that further investigation should be made on the potential impacts of the integration of RE resource on systems operation constraints, such as frequency and voltage regulation, and the results justify the importance of such investigations. Detailed studies on the impact of operation constraints on the planning and sizing of the microgrid are performed. The impact of ESS on planning studies and its potential role in system operation are analyzed. Furthermore, the impact of RE integration on reduction of diesel generation and thus carbon footprint in remote communities is evaluated. The inclusion of a demand response management strategy in microgrid planning problem is considered and its impact on the integration of RE and ESS in remote communities is analyzed.

The goal of this system is to facilitate achievement of the Project milestones of 10, 50 and 100 GFLOPS sustained performance on selected Earth and space science application codes. The additional 512 processors were purchased in March, 1998 by the NASA Earth Science Enterprise for the NASA Seasonal to Interannual Prediction Project (NSIPP). These two "halves" still operate as a single system, and must satisfy the unique requirements of both aforementioned groups, as well as guest researchers from the Earth, space, microgravity, manned space flight and aeronautics communities. Few large scalable parallel systems are configured for capability computing, so models are hard to find. This unique environment has created a challenging system administration task, and has yielded some insights into the supercomputing needs of the various NASA Enterprises, as well as insights into {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the T 3 E architecture and software. The T 3 E is a distributed memory system in which the processing elements (PE's) are connected by a low latency, high bandwidth bidirectional 3 -D torus. Due to the focus on high speed communication between PE's, the T 3 E requires PE's to be allocated contiguously per job. Further, jobs will only execute on the user specified number of PE's and PE timesharing is possible but impractical. With a highly varied job mix in both size and runtime of jobs, the resulting scenario is PE fragmentation and an inability to achieve near 100 % utilization. SGI/Cray has provided several scheduling and configuration tools to minimize the impact of fragmentation. These tools include PScheD (the political scheduler), GRM (the global resource manager) and NQE (the Network Queuing Environment). Features and impact of these tools will be discussed, as will resulting performance and utilization data. As a distributed memory system, the T 3 E is designed to be programmed through explicit message passing. Consequently, certain assumptions related to code design are made by the operating system (UNICOS/mk) and its scheduling tools. With the exception of HPF, which does run on the T 3 E, however poorly, alternative programming styles have the potential to impact the T 3 E in unexpected and undesirable ways.
