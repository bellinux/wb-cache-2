25|$|Submarines {{typically}} rely {{on speed}} and deck angle (angle of attack) rather than <b>deballasting</b> to surface; they are propelled {{at an angle}} towards the surface. Ballast tanks were almost never blown at depth, and doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control. Normal procedure was to drive the submarine to periscope depth, raise the periscope to verify the area was clear, then blow the tanks and surface the submarine.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{undergoing}} repairs, {{a tanker}} must dock at a <b>deballasting</b> station for completing the tank cleaning operations and pumping ashore its slops (dirty cleaning water and hydrocarbon residues).|$|E
50|$|Semi-submersible {{vessels are}} able to {{transform}} from a deep to a shallow draft by <b>deballasting</b> (removing ballast water from the hull), thereby becoming surface vessels. Usually they are moved from location to location in this configuration. The heavy lift vessels use this capability to submerge {{the majority of their}} structure, locate beneath another floating vessel, and then deballast to pick up the other vessel as a cargo.|$|E
50|$|Twenty {{miles to}} the south, the semi-submersible Uncle John was {{stationed}} beside the Brent Bravo platform {{just as it was}} during the Wildrake accident. When the emergency call came in at 1158, Comex Diving was monitoring a subsea pumping operation with an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle). The crew immediately recovered the ROV while the captain of the Uncle John began the process of dewatering the massive legs of the vessel. Normally it would have taken three to four hours to <b>deballast</b> the semi-submersible to raise it to transit depth, but the captain was accelerating the process by executing an emergency <b>deballast,</b> pumping water from the legs through huge fire cannons mounted on the aft end. As the Uncle John headed north on its rescue mission, huge rooster tails of cascading seawater trailed behind.|$|R
50|$|Amphibious {{transport}} docks {{perform the}} mission of amphibious transports, amphibious cargo ships, and the older LSDs by incorporating both a flight deck and a well deck that can be ballasted and <b>deballasted</b> to support landing craft or amphibious vehicles. One of the main differences between LSDs and LPDs {{is that while the}} former have a helicopter landing deck, the latter have hangar facilities in addition to a landing deck.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} oyster farming area in Europe is {{in a close}} proximity of two medium size merchant ports. Cargo ships <b>deballast</b> in this area before loading, releasing unwanted or noxious marine species. During a sampling campaign aboard these arriving ships, we found in some ballast water samples {{a huge number of}} potentially toxic dinoflagellates and some potentially pathogenic bacteria. A model was applied to find the potential geographical spread of the discharged ballast water. This model predicts the water to reach highly vulnerable shellfish farmed areas in six to eight days...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} hull collapsed {{during the}} final construction because of a design flaw. [...] It was towed into Gandsfjord where {{it was to be}} lowered in the water in a controlled ballasting operation at a rate of 1 meter per 20 minutes. This was necessary for the fitment of the deck platform to the hull. As the hull was lowered to the 65 m mark, rumbling noises were heard followed by the sound of water pouring into the unit. A cell wall had failed and a serious crack had developed, and sea water poured in at a rate that was too great for the <b>deballasting</b> pumps to deal with. Within a few minutes the hull began sinking at a rate of 1 meter per minute. As the structure sank deeper into the 210 m fjord, the buoyancy chambers imploded and the rubble struck the floor of the fjord, creating a Richter magnitude scale 3 earthquake.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One {{dimensional}} {{dynamic model}} for submarine low pressure screw compressor <b>deballasting</b> system performance analysis is developed. Cross section of outer shell of ballast tank {{is described as}} cylinder, one dimensional flow equations combined with screw compressor performance model are employed to describe compressor’s flow characteristic. Coupled effect between gas pressure in ballast tank and discharging performance of screw compressor is considered in the presenting model as gas leakage during compressing process is taken into account. <b>Deballasting</b> duration for one certain submarine model is calculated using the developed model, and the result agrees well with that obtained by using Chinese state code for submarine low pressure system design. For different cross section tank models as circular section model, parabolic section model and trapezoidal section model, dynamic performance of screw compressor <b>deballasting</b> system is studied using the validated model. Gas pressure in tank, dropping speed of tank water surface and draft of submarine are simulated, and {{the results show that}} little difference of <b>deballasting</b> duration is caused by changing tank cross section. The most stable <b>deballasting</b> process is achieved by using a circular section tank. Deballsting performance is also studied as tonnage of submarine and volume of ballast tank change and commonsense conclusions are obtained...|$|E
5000|$|Semi-submersible {{ships were}} {{developed}} to move large (project) cargoes, but have now been adapted for yacht shipping. These ships are semi-submersible. This means that by ballasting, they can submerge their cargo holds. Yachts motor under their own power into the flooded cargo holds to load. Once all the yachts are in position and secured, divers weld hull supports into place. The ship <b>deballasts</b> and sails away. At discharge port arrival, the process is reversed, with the ship ballasting, allowing the yachts to exit. Semi-submersible shipping is arranged by the owners.|$|R
50|$|The lock {{has three}} sliding gates {{constructed}} out of steel with caissons that allow to take ballast. The gates slide {{on a system}} of rollers on rails at the bottom {{at right angles to}} the longitudinal axis of the lock and disappear into special storage chamber or recess built into the sidewall of the dock. After a gate closes, it is ballasted with water and has to <b>deballast</b> before it opens again. There is one gate {{at each end of the}} lock and one in between (100 meters from the lower gate). The middle gate had to allow a faster turning time but the gain was very little so the gate was put out of service. For the first time, electrical engines were used to operate the gates.|$|R
2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be <b>deballasted</b> because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|R
40|$|The BIO-SEA® Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) {{was tested}} at the IMARES {{land-based}} test facility. General {{goal of the}} tests was to compare two different brands of filter and to test the filter efficiency of finer mesh sizes of each brand.

40|$|The {{transportation}} of organisms in the ballast water of cargo ships {{has been recognized}} {{as a source of}} invasive species despite current control measures. Pathogenic bacteria in the ballast tank have been studied but the total diversity of the ballast tank bacterial community has not been examined. This study is the first to characterize the total bacterial community within a ballast tank by constructing a clone library from a ballast water sample from a cargo ship in the Port of Houston, amplified ribosomal rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and phylogenetic analysis. Bacterial communities in Texas ports and bays were also examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), looking at both temporal and spatial variations for effects of <b>deballasting</b> activity. This ballast tank bacterial community had a high level of diversity (95 %) with the clone library only representing 40 % of the total community of the tank. Most probable originating habitats of the ballast bacteria were: marine pelagic (40 %), estuarine (37 %), coastal (6 %), freshwater (3 %) and other (14 %), even though this ballast tank was exchanged with pelagic water. Predominate groups were alpha- and gammaproteobacteria, a few betaproteobacteria and bacteriodetes, and one each of verrucomicrobia, planctomycetes and actinobacteria, but no pathogens were detected. The data reveals a ballast tank that consists of half marine-pelagic, half port bacteria, revealing a low efficacy of exchange control methods and potentially invasive bacteria. The bacterial communities of five ships that exchanged ballast water in the Pacific Ocean shared on average 50 % similarity. Two ships that exchanged ballast water in temperate latitudes were more similar than three other ships that exchanged in tropical latitudes, showing a correlation between location of exchange and community similarity. The bacterial communities of the Ports of Houston and Galveston exhibit stable, seasonal successions over one year. The port and bay systems of Texas exhibited spatial variations in bacterial communities related to salinity levels. Both experiments did not show evidence of community disruption by <b>deballasting</b> activities. This study shows that ballast water is a viable vector for invasive bacterial transport, although impact on Texas estuarine systems seems minimal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Oil is the {{pollutant}} with the longest history of international attention and vessel-source pollution {{is the most}} famous internationally regulated area of marine pollution. Ship-related oil pollution is attributed mostly to operational discharges which have consistently overshadowed accidental discharges. Most operational spills stem from ship-routine operations such as loading and discharging of cargoes, receiving bunkers, ballasting and <b>deballasting,</b> tank washing, and are caused by broken hoses, defective valves, overfilling of tanks, leaks from manifold flanges, blowing lines etc, along with the human intervention. Apparently {{the majority of these}} incidents happen either close to the mainland or within port areas and terminal stations resulting usually in small spills which are being tackled by the local authorities and are seldom reported. Accidental oil spills are the result of collisions, groundings, explosions, hull and machinery damage, war operations, mixed accidents and generally give rise to severe pollution incidents but are less frequent. In this paper we analyze 295 cases of ship incidents that caused or likely to cause oil pollution in the Mediterranean Sea during the period 1981 - 2000. The main source of information has been extracted from the REMPEC database which recorded all the incidents that had occurred in the Mediterranean Sea in the aforementioned period. We attempt to assess the available data with the aid of advanced intelligent techniques, namely machine learning and inductive decision trees. Inductive machine learning is based on entropy information criteria applied to either nominal or numerical data representing database information. The inductive learning methodology is applied for producing automated domain-dependent expert knowledge by mining the data corresponding to ship-incident reports. The outcome of the analysis corresponds to a meaningful set of decision rules, also represented as a top-down classification tree. 1...|$|E
40|$|The thesis firstly {{includes}} {{a study of}} the structure and requirements of a general ballast system. Based on this knowledge a ballast system suiting the needs of the WindFlip concept was designed through using the risk-based design methodology (RBD). The presented ballast system has one sub-system for ballasting during rotation of WindFlip from horizontal to vertical position and back again (called main ballast system). Another sub-system (called the secondary ballast system) is used during transit without payload and during onloading of payload (one Hywind floating offshore wind turbine). The latter system is connected to an eductor circuit for stripping the ballast tanks. The main ballast system ballasts by flooding the ballast tanks. The tank is ventilated so it can flood freely, ventilation is closed when the tank is completely full. As WindFlip does not have a pressure hull, pressure is increased in empty ballast tanks when being submerged to compensate for increased hydrostatic pressure. During <b>deballasting</b> ventilation is used to relieve pressure gradually. Water in the ballast tanks is purged out by compressed air. The main ballast system has two main pipelines which are branched into feeder lines going into each tank. There are two valves connected to the feeder line leading into each tank; a butterfly valve and a pressure reduction valve (PRV). The butterfly valve is used for ventilation and the PRV for the compressed air. The function of the two main lines may be switched (from vent to compressed air and vice versa), and there is an interconnection between the two also securing redundancy. The main ballast system reaches out to 102 ballast tanks. The secondary ballast system reaches out to 27 ballast tanks. The layout of this system is quite similar to common ballast systems. The main difference is that it only has one ballast pump, which is allowed for unmanned barges according to DNV. An eductor system is included in the secondary ballast system for stripping the ballast tanks. This system may however not be mandatory, this should be discussed further with the classing society. A ballast treatment plant is not included in the design as WindFlip mostly will operate locally. There is however a possibility for conducting ballast exchange with the sequential method during continental travel. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was performed in order to find the unreliability of the system. The most interesting result was that a failure during rotation is expected once every third year. The FTA was compared to the use of Bayesian networks (BN). The report shows that BN can replace the FTA and that BN is a more flexible method. </p...|$|E
