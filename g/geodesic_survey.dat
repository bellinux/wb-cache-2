50|$|There {{were three}} {{main reasons for}} the {{construction}} of the Gunbarrel Highway. The first was to provide access for a future meteorological station which was needed to forecast upper winds prior to the testing of atomic weapons in South Australia. The second was for instrumentation along the centre-line of fire for rockets launched from Woomera, and the third was to allow surveyors from the National Mapping Council to continue the <b>geodesic</b> <b>survey</b> of little known areas of outback Australia. A consequence of the construction was the completion of the first east-west road link across the centre of Australia.|$|E

After the first Brocken lodge had been destroyed by a fire, a new hotel opened in 1862. The Brocken Garden, a botanical garden, was laid out in 1890 by Professor Albert Peter of Göttingen University on an area of 4600 m2 granted by Count Otto of Stolberg-Wernigerode. It was Germany's first Alpine garden.|$|E

50|$|In 1750, Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille had {{measured}} a triangulation meridian arc northwards from Cape Town, {{to determine}} {{the figure of the}} earth, and found that the curvature of the earth was less in southern latitudes than at corresponding northern ones. Sir George Everest visited the Cape in 1820 and visited the site of La Caille's measurements.From his experience in the Himalayas he believed that the presence of considerable mountain masses in the Cape could have caused false measurements to be made by La Caille. Between 1841 and 1848, Maclear would be occupied in performing a <b>geodesic</b> <b>survey</b> for the purpose of recalculating the dimensions and shape of the Earth. He became close friends with David Livingstone, and they shared a common interest in the exploration of Africa. He performed many other useful scientific activities, including collecting meteorological, magnetic and tide data.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s and {{continuing}} into the 1980s surplus SHORAN systems had become widely used to provide precision navigation in {{oil and gas exploration}} industry. Companies like pioneer Offshore Navigation, Inc., Navigation Management, Coastal Surveys (based in Singapore) and Western Geophysical deployed SHORAN receivers to navigate seismic survey vessels and position drilling rigs around the world. The technology was key to the successful development of the offshore oil & gas industry in the postwar era. Truck-portable SHORAN transponders and up to 90 ft antennas were set up within a few feet of <b>geodesic</b> <b>survey</b> markers near the coast. SHORAN chains consisting of three or four shore stations were used to provide highly accurate navigation across large exploration tracts and as much as 200 mi offshore. Frequently, the massive vacuum tube transmitters were fitted with solid-state control boxes for more reliable operation and to improve reception of weaker signals over the horizon.|$|E

It is important to identify the targets that present atypical measurements to permit managers to take corrective actions. After fitting a model using the Least Squares Method (LSM), the residuals normally display random behavior. Multivariate control charts are then applied to the residuals of the fitted model from data taken of <b>geodesic</b> <b>survey</b> campaigns conducted at different epochs. Control charts have been widely applied in other fields of research than production processes such as public health, marketing, services. The results show that it is possible for monitoring the multi-temporal stability by the multivariate control charts.

Much of the correspondence among contemporary scientists and their associates is now digitally available through the ePistolarium webtool, allowing current scientists and historians unfettered access to transcriptions of some 20, 000 letters from the Dutch Golden Age. This wealth of information offers unprecedented insights in the involvement of 17 th Century thinkers in the scientific issues of the day, including descriptions of their efforts in developing methods to accurately determine longitude at sea. Unsurprisingly, the body of correspondence referring to this latter aspect is largely dominated by letters involving Christiaan Huygens.

50|$|Roy's use of {{scientific}} advancements and accurate mathematical formulas {{paved the way}} for modern <b>geodesic</b> <b>surveying.</b> His tenure and his work are the dividing line between older, approximate mappings and newer, highly accurate ones in Britain. He is cited repeatedly in early nineteenth century mathematics textbooks for his use of spherical trigonometry in surveying. Early twentieth century technical books on modern surveying and geodesy include Roy's work as the historical starting point for the modern profession. Perhaps his greatest legacy of all was the work of the Ordnance Survey which commenced in 1791, one year after his death, by extending the basic Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790) to the rest of Great Britain over the following sixty years.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 Toll led an {{expedition}} of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences {{to the northern}} parts of Yakutia and explored the region between the lower reaches of the Lena and Khatanga Rivers. Eduard Toll became the first to map the plateau between the Anabar and Popigay Rivers and a mountain ridge between the Olenek and Anabar Rivers (which he named after Vasily Pronchischev). He also carried out geological surveys in the basins of the following rivers: Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma. During one year and two days the expedition covered 25,000 km, of which 4,200 km were up the rivers, carrying out <b>geodesic</b> <b>surveys</b> en route. Owing to the difficulties of the expedition and his hard work, the Russian Academy of Sciences awarded Eduard v. Toll with the N.M. Przhevalsky Large Silver Medal.|$|R
40|$|In many cases, a {{flood wave}} has a {{pronounced}} transforming {{effect on the}} channel, and {{the knowledge of the}} watercourse longitudinal and lateral profiles is of great importance. To obtain data meeting these requirements with adequate accuracy, we alternated the conven-tional geodesic methods with sonar-based approaches – ADCP – and with results from the CroSolver software, constructed for obtaining bathymetric information. We compare results achieved from two approaches for preparing geometric data for hydrodynamic models. The respective approaches are considered as possible replacements for the costly conventional geodesic methods. The proposed methods use either data available from the continual monitoring of surface water courses (i. e., discharge measurements), which can capture precisely the lateral channel profile within the entire longitudinal profile, or a robust sonar-based system. Results obtained from the conducted studies show that our statement about a possibility to synthesize the ALS data with data from hydrological measurements or ADCP sonar in preparing watercourse computational geometry, is valid. A very good agreement was achieved between lateral profiles (determined inundation areas) prepared by using the CroSolver software or the ADCP sonar with lateral profiles established by <b>geodesic</b> <b>surveying...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen Maser is the {{extremely}} high-performance time and frequency standard, which all terms of performance are excellent. It has {{played an important}} role in the fields of the fundamental theory, navigation, radar, <b>geodesic</b> <b>survey,</b> astronomical observation, communication etc. The traditional Hydrogen Maser has extremely high-performance time and frequency standard, but it is too big for space use. With the development of the space science technology, compact and portable hydrogen maser with high performance is in great demand. The main content of this thesis is to design a positive feedback circuit of the Q-enhanced hydrogen maser with a stable loaded Q and a stable feedback phase. This thesis first gives a brief introduction to the theory of the compact hydrogen maser and the Q-enhanced hydrogen maser. And then introduce the principle of the PID controller. Based on the theoretical analysis, it computes the parameters of demanded components and makes selections accordingly. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 give a detailed account of hardware and software design process. After many times of test and a long time of verification, we give the final test results of the system as well as analysis in Chapter 5. The results indicate that the newly designed system has accomplished prospective purpose, and some parameters has surpassed prospective index. At last, the thesis gives some of my suggestions about the followed improvement of the system. 随着经济的发展以及卫星技术的进步，近年来卫星导航系统在全球越来越广泛的应用。我国也建立了具有自主知识产权的区域性卫星导航系统，北斗卫星导航定位系统。为了进一步建立北斗卫星导航定位系统，性能更高、重量更轻、工作更稳定的原子频标不可或缺。现在北斗系统的星载频标为铷钟，其性能指标还有一定的不足，选用性能指标更好的小型氢原子频标是目前重要的研究课题。 本文基于现代控制理论与先进的电子技术设计了一种具有腔Q值及反馈环路相位稳定特性的Q增强型氢钟的正反馈电路；使Q增强型氢钟能够长期稳定的工作并进一步向实用化方向发展，成为真正可以使用的高性能、体积小、重量轻的工程化原子频标。 本文首先分析了Q增强型氢钟正反馈电路的基本工作原理，并对PID控制器原理进行了阐述。在第三章和第四章详细介绍了硬件和软件的设计过程。在对整个电路进行反复的调试以及检测后，在第五章给出系统的测试结果和分析，测试结果达到预期目标。文章最后给出了未来设计改进的一些想法...|$|E

Law 10. 267 establishes that every and any land public register, either for sale, purchase, dismemberment, rememberment or parceling can’t be made without having the area vertices geo-referenced to the Brazilian Geodesic System with precision better than 50 cm. Geo-referenced surveys are based on measurements of different natures with the objective to determine angles, distances and positions. It is important to understand that every measurement performed by the man can contain mistakes, not mattering the kind of technology used. Therefore, there is the necessity of scientific criterion application for the survey performance and confirmation of parameters determined. The mistakes propagate themselves in the execution of topographic and <b>geodesic</b> <b>surveys,</b> affecting, for example, the determination of frontier coordinates and consequently their correspondence with the reality.

Introduction Reflections with respect to points and curves and, more generally, with respect to submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds are generalizations of reflections with respect to linear subspaces of a Euclidean space. The reflections with respect to points and curves have been studied by different authors. It turns out that their properties strongly influence the curvature of the manifold and that one can characterize certain classes of manifolds (e. g., locally symmetric spaces and real space forms) by using properties of the reflections with respect to their points or their <b>geodesics.</b> For a <b>survey</b> of results of this type, we refer to [4], [14].

40|$|Different {{approaches}} are compared to formulation {{of quantum mechanics}} of a particle on the curved spaces. At first, the canonical, quasi-classical and path integration formalisms are considered for quantization of geodesic motion on the Rimannian configurational spaces. A unique rule of ordering of operators in the canonical formalism and a unique definition of the path integral are established and, thus, a part of ambiguities in the quantum counterpart of geodesic motion is removed. A geometric interpretation is proposed for non-invariance of the quantum mechanics on coordinate transformations. An approach alternative to the quantization of <b>geodesic</b> motion is <b>surveyed,</b> which starts with the quantum theory of a neutral scalar field. Consequences of this alternative approach and the three formalisms of quantization are compared. In particular, the field theoretical approach generates a deformation of the canonical commutation relations between coordinates and momenta of a prticle. A possible cosmological consequence of the deformation is presented in short. Key words: quantum mechanics, Riemannian space, geodesic motion, deformation. Comment: 31 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{presenting}} a critical overview of the XVIIIth century documents stored in Archives of RAS (ff. 3 and 20 – manuscripts by Lomonosov) and RSAAD (f. 248 – documents of the Senate). This period is rich in the documental base; methodological views by V. N. Tatitschev and M. V. Lomonsov are {{the core of the}} article. The analyzed sources are divided into three groups: enactions on the issues relating to mapping, geodesy and frontier surveying; civil letters; authorial instructions. The choice of sources is caused by both their capacity to be unexceptionable material in the course of reconstructing historic and cultural landscapes and {{by the fact that they}} concern, firstly, requirements for writing place-names on Russian maps, and secondly, gathering techniques of place-names. It is of vital importance to deduce how the attitude of surveyors, geodesists and scholars in general towards the problem of gathering and processing geographical names changed during fledging years of Russian cartography. The article concludes that the Geographical Department of the Russian Empire (having been responsible for all the <b>geodesic</b> and <b>surveying</b> procedures at that time) didn’t manage to solve the problem of developing commonly used principles of writing place-names on maps, and in fact delegated complete control over it to map-makers. This yielded, as a result, to the “free will” in marking place-names onto maps. The latter in its turn caused the occurrence of multiple linguistic mistakes on Russian maps of the XVIIIth century. It became a reason for reexamination of the whole cartographical perspective later, in the XIXth century. However the problem of place-names standardization has become the real focus of scientific research only since late 1930 s. ...|$|R
