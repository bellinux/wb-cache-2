50|$|The <b>gravity</b> <b>process</b> {{begins by}} {{preheating}} the mold to 150-200 °C (300-400 °F) {{to ease the}} flow and reduce thermal damage to the casting. The mold cavity is then coated with a refractory material or a mold wash, which prevents the casting from sticking to the mold and prolongs the mold life. Any sand or metal cores are then installed and the mold is clamped shut. Molten metal is then poured into the mold. Soon after solidification the mold is opened and the casting removed to reduce chances of hot tears. The process is then started all over again, but preheating is not required because {{the heat from the}} previous casting is adequate and the refractory coating should last several castings. Because this process is usually carried out on large production run work-pieces automated equipment is used to coat the mold, pour the metal, and remove the casting.|$|E

40|$|How high-mass stars form {{remains unclear}} currently. Calculation {{suggests}} that the radiation pressure of a forming star can halt spherical infall, preventing its further growth when it reaches 10 M_. Two major theoretical models on the further growth of stellar mass were proposed. One model suggests the mergence of less massive stellar objects, {{and the other is}} still through accretion but with the help of disk. Inflow motions are the key evidence of how forming stars further gain mass to build up massive stars. Recent development in technology has boosted the search of inflow motion. A number of high-mass collapse candidates were obtained with single dish observations, mostly showed blue profile. The infalling signatures seem to be more common in regions with developed radiation pressure than in younger cores, which opposes the theoretical prediction and is also very different from that of low mass star formation. Interferometer studies so far confirm such tendency with more obvious blue profile or inverse P Cygni profile. Results seem to favor the accretion model. However, the evolution tendency of the infall motion in massive star forming cores needs to be further explored. Direct evidence for monolithic or competitive collapse processes is still lack.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} model of spacecraft motion was developed {{based on the}} assumption that the net torque vector due to crew activity and rocket thruster firings is a statistically stationary Gaussian vector process. The process had zero ensemble mean value, and the components of the torque vector were mutually stochastically independent. The linearized rigid-body equations of motion were used to derive the autospectral density functions of the components of the spacecraft rotation vector. The cross-spectral density functions of the components of the rotation vector vanish for all frequencies so that the components of rotation were mutually stochastically independent. The autospectral and cross-spectral density functions of the induced gravity environment imparted to scientific apparatus rigidly attached to the spacecraft were calculated from the rotation rate spectral density functions via linearized inertial frame to body-fixed principal axis frame transformation formulae. The induced <b>gravity</b> <b>process</b> was a Gaussian one with zero mean value. Transformation formulae were used to rotate the principal axis body-fixed frame to which the rotation rate and induced gravity vector were referred to a body-fixed frame in which the components of the induced gravity vector were stochastically independent.

Fossil, especially sub recent landslides can show us unstable and potentially dangerous areas to which we should pay attention today. A unique insight into different slope processes in nature is certainly Rebrnice area, where you can research the characteristics of the fossil landslides while observing the activity of the recent landslidess. The slope deposit in the Rebrnice area were described and mapped by many authors but nobody has covered the transport mechanisms and depositional processes of quaternary slope deposit in detail. This doctoral thesis presents the study of slope deposit elaborated with the geologicalgeomorphological approach. With the visual interpretation of the shaded digital elevation model and indicator of surface roughness, which are calculated from the data of airborne laser scanning in the combination of geological mapping, we can in most cases clearly identify the form of the prevalence and surface characteristics of individual sedimentary bodies. On the basis of the lithological, stratigraphic and architectural characteristics of the slope deposit 16 facies were separated, indicating the final articles of diverse sedimentary processes within complex and often interlaced and interdependent transport mechanisms.

40|$|The {{development}} of economically feasible and environmentally benign processes {{for the production}} of second generation biofuels is an ongoing effort. The production of bio-ethanol from wood (spruce) using high gravity (high solids content) fermentation is one process concept that is currently under development. Such a process will lead to lower water use in the process, and consequently to lower energy use. However, high gravity conditions have adverse effects on the micro-organisms and high yields are thus not guaranteed. All this will affect the environmental impact of the process. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact of the process along its development path. The main objective of the LCA is to help improve the process under development from an environmental point of view. The LCA is {{based on the results of}} lab experiments that were done for the high gravity fermentation process using pretreated spruce as the feedstock. These experiments focused on the process configuration and detoxification strategies in order to increase yields. A spreadsheet model was set up that used the experimental data in order to calculate the mass and energy balances of the system under study, from the harvesting of the wood until the produced ethanol leaves the plant (cradle-to-gate). The results of the mass and energy balances were subsequently used in the LCA model in order to calculate the environmental impact of the ethanol production. The outcomes of the LCA for all the process variants studied were compared in order to identify the weak and strong points of the process. This information can then be used for further {{development of}} the technology. This poster presents the results of the LCA based on the lab experiments for this wood-based high <b>gravity</b> <b>process</b> under development. Comparisons are made with wood-based ethanol production using a fermentation process at lower solids content, and with ethanol production using first-generation feedstocks and technology.

The study region is bounded in the south by the Capbreton canyon. The northern area, which shows a smooth morphology, is characterised by small-scale deformations due to sediment creep or low-amplitude slide processes. The deformations are associated with mini listric-like faults that bound packets of sediments in which the deposit geometry is typical of constructional sediment waves. These sediment waves result from the interaction of depositional and <b>gravity</b> deformation <b>processes.</b> In the southern area, closer to the canyon, wave-like structures are still present but mostly of smaller size.

The age of the sliding event responsible for the formation of the depression observed today could be middle to upper Quaternary.

A set of confined sediment drifts (the “Kveithola Drift”) is {{located in the}} inner part of the trough. We provide {{for the first time a}} detailed morphological, seismostratigraphic, lithological and sedimentological insight into this sediment drift. The PARASOUND data show that the drift is mainly well-stratified, characterized by sub-parallel reflections of moderate to high amplitude and good lateral continuity. The reflectors show an abrupt pinch-out on the northern edge where a distinct moat is present, and a gradual tapering to the south. Internally we identify the base of the drift and four internal horizons, which we correlate throughout the drift. Two units display high amplitude reflectors, marked lensoidal character and restricted lateral extent, suggesting a relatively larger contribution of <b>gravity</b> <b>processes</b> to the drift growth. Facies typical for contourite deposition are found in the sediment cores, with strongly bioturbated sediments and abundant silty/sandy mottles that contain shell fragments. These characteristics suggest a strong control by a bottom current flowing along the moat on the northern edge of the drift. Brine-enriched shelf water (BSW) produced during winter and flowing westward in the moat, is suggested to be responsible for the genesis of the Kveithola Drift. The formation of BSW is inferred to have started around 13 cal. ka BP, the onset of drift deposition, suggesting that conditions leading to atmospheric cooling of the surface waters and/or the presence of coastal polynyas and wind have persisted on the western Barents Shelf since that time. The units which formed under a larger influence of <b>gravity</b> <b>processes</b> (dated to the Younger Dryas and to 8. 9 - 8. 2 cal ka BP) indicate that bottom current activity was reduced during these two climatically colder periods, possibly due to expanded grounded and sea ice cover over the Barents SeaPeer Reviewe...|$|R

During this period, the most probable natural event able to trigger a turbidity current was the violent storm which affected the French Atlantic coast on 27 December 1999.
