40|$|Abstract. Beef {{carcasses}} undergoing rapid pH fall {{while the}} loin muscle temperature is still high {{are described as}} heat-shortened, heat-toughened or ‘high rigor temperature ’ carcasses, with subsequent negative effects on quality traits. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the occurrence of high rigor temperature in beef carcasses across Australia and to identify the causative factors. Datawascollectedover 4 – 5 daysat eachof sevenbeefprocessingplants from 1512 beef carcasses. Thebeef carcasses were from both grass- and grain-fed cattle ranging in days on grain feeding from 0 (grass-fed) to 350 days and the category of cattle ranged from veal to ox and cow. Data collected on the day of slaughter included the duration of electrical inputs at the immobiliser, electrical stimulation and <b>hide</b> <b>puller,</b> longissimusmuscle pH and temperature decline, hot carcass weight and P 8 fat depth. At grading, ultimate pH, eye muscle area, wetness of the loin surface and colour score were also collected. The temperature at pH 6 was calculated and if it was> 35 C, the carcass was defined as ‘high rigor temperature’. Modelling of the data was conducted using GLMM and REML. The occurrence of high rigor temperature across all seven beef processing plants was 74. 6 % ranging from 56 to 94 %between beef processing plants. Increasing days in the feedlot and heavier carcass weights were highly correlated and both caused an increase in the predicted temperature at pH 6 and in the% high rigor temperature (P < 0. 05 for both). Longer duration of electrical inputs at the <b>hide</b> <b>puller,</b> fatter grass-fed cattle and fattermale (castrate) carcasses had a higher temperature at pH 6 and higher%high rigor temperature. Modelling showed that if the time to reach pH 6 in the longissimusmusclewas 65 v. 105 min, the%high rigor temperature carcasses reduced from 9...|$|E
40|$|The beef {{industry}} has made tremendous strides in reducing pathogen contamination on carcasses. Multiple antimicrobial interventions have been validated {{for their use}} during harvesting. Information in regards to cross-contamination with pathogens in the post-harvest environment is limited. Surrogate microorganisms for enteric pathogens are commonly used to validate antimicrobial interventions and might allow for the simulation of cross-contamination through the post-harvest environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how the post-harvest environment impacts the direct and indirect transmission of pathogens. This was achieved by using fluorescent protein-marked surrogate strains of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp. from inoculated carcasses to the adjacent ones and to the equipment and facility in three different abattoirs. Thirteen hide-on carcasses were inoculated using a gelatin-based slurry containing three nonpathogenic fluorescent protein-marked strains of E. coli biotype I. In order to determine direct and indirect cross-contamination, inoculated and adjacent carcasses were sampled (300 cm 2) during the harvesting process at different stages: after hide opening (AHO), prior to evisceration (PE), after evisceration (AE), after splitting (AS), and after final intervention (AFI). Environmental samples consisting of the floor, walls, and air were tested as well as personal equipment including gloves, boots, and aprons. Equipment including hand knives, air knives, meat hooks, <b>hide</b> <b>puller</b> and split saw were also sampled. Results showed evidence of cross-contamination between inoculated carcasses and the adjacent non-inoculated ones for all abattoirs. Although this occurred in all abattoirs, surrogate counts on carcasses were below detectable levels (< 1. 4 log CFU/cm 2) after antimicrobial interventions. Surrogates were found in low levels for all environmental samples. However surrogate counts from equipment such as knives, split saws, meat hooks, and <b>hide</b> <b>puller</b> were more frequently detected (15 percent) than those found on the floor, air and walls samples (10 percent). In the case of aprons, boots, and gloves, the prevalence of countable surrogate samples was 7 percent...|$|E

2500|$|The {{snapping}} is {{used for}} hunting (hence the alternative name [...] "pistol shrimp"), {{as well as for}} communication. When hunting, the shrimp usually lies in an obscured spot, such as a burrow. The shrimp then extends its antennae outwards to determine if any fish are passing by. Once it feels movement, the shrimp inches out of its <b>hiding</b> place, <b>pulls</b> back its claw, and releases a [...] "shot" [...] which stuns the prey; the shrimp then pulls it to the burrow and feeds.|$|R

50|$|Hide glue also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the glue begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may glue the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide glue, and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide glue starts to gel, {{at which point the}} glue becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the <b>hide</b> glue <b>pulls</b> the joint together as it hardens.|$|R

50|$|The word flesh-hook is {{relatively}} modern.

It may also have been used as a tool to prod animals. The use of this flesh-hook in the Bronze-age can only be speculated.|$|R

50|$|Baillargeon's {{research}} on causal reasoning in infants furthered understanding concerning Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Piaget's experiments {{on the development}} of a concept of object permanence in infants required the children to manually search for the <b>hidden</b> object by <b>pulling</b> a cover off to reveal the object. Baillargeon argues that Piaget's finding regarding infants' failure to understand object permanence until 8-12 months old was rooted in a lack of motor ability as opposed to inadequate cognitive development. In an effort to account for infants' lack of motor skills, Baillargeon's studies of object permanence measure infants' fixation times on impossible versus possible events.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not the}} politest way of {{welcoming}} a visitor. It increased Trevor's suspicions. The man was afraid. A {{great idea}} darted into his mind. Why not {{go straight to the}} point and have it out with him here and now? He had the League's letter about the bat in his pocket. He would confront him with it and insist on searching the study there and then. If Rand-Brown were really, as he suspected, the writer of the letter, the bat must be in this room somewhere.

50|$|The {{next step}} is stretching/drying. This is time sensitive, {{and has to be}} done from start to finish without stopping. The drying <b>hide</b> is {{continuously}} <b>pulled</b> and stretched in all directions, which lubricates the fibers of the hide with the oil of the dressing, and ensures that the fibers stay lubricated. This may be done on a rack with a stretching tool, or by hand. Often the hide is stretched against a steel cable or a rounded steel or wooden blade (with care not to cut the hide). This must be done until the hide is completely dry and no longer cool to the touch or else the finished buckskin will be stiff, and will have to be dressed and stretched over again.|$|R

He motivates the remaining passengers to reinforce all the windows in the cabin to help prevent further break-ins by the werewolves. Paul is killed by the werewolf when it manages to break into the train, however it is killed by all of the other passengers fighting together. However, its deathcries manage to alert the rest of its nearby pack, who are now also drawn to the train. Billy offers to help repair the train, and is accompanied by Matthew to act as a lookout. However, Matthew is distracted by calls for help, and wanders into the forest, only to be confronted and killed by three werewolves just when he discovers the half eaten body of Nina up in a tree. Billy manages to repair the train enough so that Joe can start the train. However, with the werewolves circling the train, Billy <b>hides</b> by <b>pulling</b> himself up into the undercarriage as the train starts moving. Kate is thrown out of the train by Adrian and killed by the werewolves. While trying to hold on, Billy accidentally pulls on the fuel line, which disables the train again.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was going}} to London, he gravely {{informed}} me, on a matter of indescribable interest to him. It was a secret for the present, but he hoped to tell it me soon; it had made a great difference already {{in the way in}} which he looked at the slanders spoken of him in Thorpe Ambrose; he was too happy to care what the scandal-mongers said of him now, and he should soon stop their mouths by appearing in a new character that would surprise them all. So he blundered on, with the firm persuasion that he was keeping me quite in the dark. It was hard not to laugh, when I thought of my anonymous letter on its way to the major; but I managed to control myself--though, I must own, with some difficulty. As the time wore on, I began to feel a terrible excitement; the position was, I think, a little too much for me. There I was, alone with him, talking in the most innocent, easy, familiar manner, and having it in my mind all the time to brush his life out of my way, when the moment comes, as I might brush a stain off my gown. It made my blood leap, and my cheeks flush. I caught myself laughing once or twice much louder than I ought; and long before we got to London I thought it desirable to put my face in <b>hiding</b> by <b>pulling</b> down my veil.|$|R

50|$|The {{first man}} in Mamu {{creation}} stories was Ngagangunu, {{who set up}} camp after coming from the east, beyond the sea to the Herbert River. Troubled by a boil on his leg, he squeezed it, and a child sprang out, which, as the first human, also took {{the name of his}} father, Ngagangunu signifying 'thigh-born'. Lacking milt, he fed the child with the blood of the hearts of kangaroos and wallabies. Two sisters came upon the campsite while he was out hunting, and suckled the child, qujickly hiding up a tree when they heard the elder Ngagangunu returning. He got the child to suck the blood of a wallaby's heart, but having just been fed breast milk, he vomited the white milk, as Ngagangunu immediately observed. Aroused, he crept about the surrounding bushland wielding a large erection, searching for the female culprits. His mighty penis made the younger sister break out in uncontrolled laughter, revealing their <b>hiding</b> place. He <b>pulled</b> them down from the tree and tried to copulate with both, unsuccessfully. For her found himself poking, nothing.|$|R

Kristen orders that Brady and Theresa's blood be drawn {{in order to find}} a suitable donor. Melanie (Molly Burnett) begins investigating and eventually fits the clues together and reveals to Brady that Theresa was pregnant, he is the father, and that Kristen has stolen the baby. Kristen is informed that Theresa is a suitable match for the baby and orders her henchman, Clint (Lucas Kerr) to bring her to her. Brady sets out to find Kristen. He gets her location from Victor. Despite his objections, Melanie decides to stowaway on Brady's private plane, providing backup in his confrontation with Kristen. When Brady confronts Kristen with the allegation that she's stolen his child, she vehemently denies it. Brady searches the castle and leaves empty handed. Melanie sneaks into the castle and finds the baby in a secret room. Kristen catches Melanie and uses her to lure Brady back to the castle. Kristen presents the baby as Daniel Jonas'. Unsure if Kristen is telling the truth, Brady demands a paternity and maternity test. Kristen takes Brady and Melanie captive. Thinking that she's being taken on a luxury vacation, Theresa arrives at the castle with Clint. Kristen drugs Theresa and has her taken to the baby's room for the bone marrow procedure. Kristen gives Brady one last look at his child and leaves him with Melanie to be executed. Kristen goes to leave the castle with the baby and finds Marlena, who accidentally grabbed hold of the wrong address to find Paul (Christopher Sean) and John, at her doorstep.
