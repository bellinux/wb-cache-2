5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} mentions of Marchington the place is in an manuscript held in the British National Archives; A.D. 951. King Eadred to Wulfhelm, miles; grant of land at Marchington, Staffs. Later on Marchington is mentioned in the Domesday book where it is listed amongst the lands given to Henry de Ferrers by the King. The land consisted of {{four and a half}} square leagues of woodland and meadow; 40 acre of pasture and work for more than seven ploughs. It was worth one hundred shillings. The lands remained in the ownership of the de Ferrers family as part of the earldom of Derby until the failure of the rebeilion of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl. After his death in 1279, his widow, Eleanor, failed in a legal case to prove that she had a <b>dower</b> <b>interest</b> in the land. The lands were then held by the king's brother, Edmund, 1st Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
5000|$|In 1346/7 Theobald was sued in {{the name}} [...] "de Gorges" [...] by Elizabeth, widow of his uncle Ralph, 2nd Baron Gorges (d.1331), for the manor of Knighton. Judgement was given in her favour, but, as she had no issue by Ralph, the manor reverted to Theobald by 1362. On the death of Theobald in 1380, the manor of Knighton, less a <b>dower</b> <b>interest</b> of 1/3, passed {{successively}} to his sons Sir Randolf (Ralph?) (d.1382), Bartholomew (d.1395/6) and Thomas (d.1404), all of whom chose to use the Gorges family name alone. Theobald's widow Agnes, presumably {{the mother of the}} 3 sons, died in 1400, when her customary dower share of 1/3 reverted to Thomas. Thomas left a son John, who died in 1413 aged only 15, leaving his 10-year-old brother Theobald as heir. In 1462 Sir Theobald Gorges was in possession of Knighton, and probably died without issue as the manor of Knighton reverted via the Russell family to John Haket (d.1498) of Wolverton, Isle of Wight, 1st cousin & heir of Thomas Russell (d.1431) son of Sir Maurice Russell (d.1416).|$|E
50|$|Within {{two years}} Lena Steingut had engaged {{a lawyer to}} seek support from Simon pending divorce. Steingut agreed but objected to the {{allegations}} of cruelty, telling all that his wife (at six feet, almost 14 inches taller than him) regularly beat him. A reconciliation occurred and the couple had another son, Edward (born April 20, 1900; he went to Commercial High School in Brooklyn). But at a high society ball in 1901, Simon had a jealous outburst. Lena retaliated by hiring detectives who eventually discovered Simon’s relations with a singer (“Blond Cora” Brown) who Lena sued for $100,000 and then instituted divorce proceedings on May 22, 1902. Testimony was taken {{in the beginning of}} 1903, before Justice Hall. The Sun claimed that the action was a “shock” to the East Side, which looked on their marriage as a “model.” The divorce decree became absolute on April 16. Like the earlier one, it also prohibited Steingut from remarrying, but he claimed he could remarry in New Jersey. Four months later, just {{as he was about to}} fulfill his promise by marrying an “actress” with “a position at the Metropolitan Opera,” he learned that a divorced wife still had a <b>dower</b> <b>interest</b> in any real estate he purchased. He vowed to have this law changed. Divorce reform was a legislative goal for his son Irwin as well.|$|E
50|$|From the 1270s Hawise {{began to}} take more a {{prominent}} role in the management of the family estates, in part perhaps because she was much younger than her aging, though still active, husband Gruffudd. Around 1270 she took personal control of her brother Hamon's manor of Church Stretton, Shropshire, while he went on crusade, and ultimately assumed full responsibility for the manor in her own right when Hamon died on crusade. She was a figure of family authority, seemingly central to the arrangements made both for her children's marriages and for the future of her husband's patrimonial lands. In providing for the family after his death, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn made sure his Hawise's dower was preserved. In 1277 he issued a charter to his wife granting her <b>dower</b> <b>interests</b> then included the township of Buttington, the commotes of Deuddwr and Caereinion and pastures in Cyfeiliog and Arwystli. Certain of these territories had also been held in dower by her mother-in-law Margaret Corbet.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{photograph}} of the {{last will and testament}} of Robert Fuller Fitz, Southern California, 1932. “and bequeath, in fee, the whole of my estate to my next heirs-at-law, including such devisees, legatees, their successors in interest and such contestants, according to the laws of succession then in force of the state of my last residence, anything to the contrary in this will notwithstanding. Each and all of the provisions made in this will for my wife are in lieu of any and all rights or claims and estates she may have in our community property, if any there be (I consider that practically all of my estate is my sole and separate property), or in my separate estate by reason of any right of <b>dower</b> or other <b>interest.</b> Should she elect to claim or receive any part of our community property, or any part of my estate (exclusive, however, of a family allowance during probate of this my will) otherwise than under and pursuant to the terms of this will, she shall receive no benefits or real or personal property hereunder; and each and all of the provisions herein made for her shall thereupon lapse and become null and void, and the property or interest which she might otherwise have been entitled to receive under this will, shall go to the other beneficiaries hereunder as above provided, to the exclusion of my wife. I thus require her to take an election because it is my firm belief that she will be better provided for if she elects to receive the provisions of this will. I nominate and appoint the Title Insurance & Trust Company, of Los Angeles, California, a California corporation, to be the executor hereunder, and I request that it as executor and my trustees, or any administrator or trustee acting hereunder, shall be exempt from giving surety or sureties upon their bond as such. I hereby authorize my said executor and the trustees hereunder, to sell and convey any or all of my estate, real or personal, without license of court, free and discharged of all trusts, and without any liability upon the part of the purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money.

40|$|Renunciation of her {{deceased}} husband 2 ̆ 7 s will entitles a widow to {{a specified}} {{percentage of the}} husband 2 ̆ 7 s net estate (or a <b>dower</b> <b>interest)</b> in lieu of any benefits she would otherwise have received under the will. The size of the dissenting widow 2 ̆ 7 s share differs among the several states, but the normal range is from one third to one half of her husband 2 ̆ 7 s net estate. In some jurisdictions the widow 2 ̆ 7 s share is determined, {{in whole or in}} part, according to the portion to which she would be entitled if her husband had died intestate, but in these jurisdictions the widow 2 ̆ 7 s share generally cannot exceed a specified percentage of the estate. The property of the decedent that is subject to the widow 2 ̆ 7 s dissent is described by such terms as 2 ̆ 2 the net estate, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 the surplus after payment of debts, 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 remainder of the personal property. 2 ̆ 2 Whatever language is employed, the thrust of the statutory provisions is to protect a widow by giving her an election to take, in lieu of her husband 2 ̆ 7 s testamentary gifts, a specified share of his real and personal property remaining after payment of funeral expenses, administrative expenses, and other claims against the estate...|$|E
