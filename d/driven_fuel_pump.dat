Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine <b>driven</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E

40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on single-cylinder test engines to determine the performance characteristics of four types of combustion chambers designed for aircraft oil engines. Two of the combustion chambers studied were bulb-type precombustion chambers, the connecting orifice of one having been designed to produce high turbulence by tangential air flow in both the precombustion chamber and the cylinder. The other two were integral combustion chambers, one being dome-shaped and the other pent-roof shaped. The injection systems used included cam and eccentric <b>driven</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> and diaphragm and spring-loaded fuel-injection valves. A diaphragm type maximum cylinder pressure indicator was used in part of these investigations with which the cylinder pressures were controlled to definite valves. The performance of the engines when equipped {{with each of the}} combustion chambers is discussed. The best performance for the tests reported was obtained with a bulb-type combustion chamber designed to give a high degree of turbulence within the bulb and cylinder. (author) ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMeasurement of the static-pressure distribution {{over the surface}} of a rotor disk was attempted using pressure sensitive paint (PSP). A uniform stress, high speed rotor disk, fitted with a shock generator, was built, installed and operated at speeds in excess of 20, 000 RPM by a Hamilton Standard turbine <b>driven</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b> A once per revolution trigger signal was converted to a transistor to transistor logic (TTL) format and used to gate an intensified charged coupled device (CCD) video camera. Multiple low intensity level camera exposures were integrated and captured to produce a single usable image. Ten captured images were averaged to increase the image's signal to noise ratio and the result was used to produce an image ratio with respect to a static reference condition. Finally, a pseudo coloring process was used to develop a color image that related intensities to both temperature and pressure distributions in accordance with the Stern-Volmer relation. Paint stripping and temperature dependence prevented the measurement of pressure at transonic speeds.

50|$|Germany {{had very}} active rocket {{development}} {{before and during}} World War II, both for the strategic V-2 rocket and other missiles. The V-2 used an alcohol/LOX liquid propellant engine, with hydrogen peroxide to <b>drive</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> The alcohol was mixed with water for engine cooling. Both Germany and the United States developed reusable liquid propellant rocket engines that used a storeable liquid oxidizer with much greater density than LOX and a liquid fuel that would ignite spontaneously on contact with the high density oxidizer. The German engine was powered by hydrogen peroxide and a fuel mixture of hydrazine hydrate and methyl alcohol. The U.S. engine was powered by nitric acid oxidizer and aniline. Both engines were used to power aircraft, the Me-163B Komet interceptor {{in the case of}} the German engine and RATO units to assist take-off of aircraft {{in the case of the}} U.S. engine.|$|R

5000|$|Fuel is {{injected}} by a constant flow injection system. There is an engine <b>driven</b> mechanical <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> and about 42 <b>fuel</b> nozzles. The <b>pump</b> can flow 100 usgal L per minute at 7500 rpm and [...] fuel pressure. In general 10 injectors {{are placed in}} the injector hat above the supercharger, 16 in the intake manifold and two per cylinder in the cylinder head. Usually a race is started with a leaner mixture, then as the clutch begins to tighten as the engine speed builds, the air/fuel mixture is enriched. As the increased engine speed builds up pump pressure, the mixture is made leaner to maintain a predetermined ratio {{that is based on}} many factors, especially race track surface friction. The stoichiometry of both methanol and nitromethane is considerably greater than that of racing gasoline, as they have oxygen atoms attached to their carbon chains and gasoline does not. This means that a [...] "fueler" [...] engine will provide power over a very broad range from very lean to very rich mixtures. Thus, to attain maximum performance, before each race, by varying the level of fuel supplied to the engine, the mechanical crew may select power outputs barely below the limits of tire traction. Power outputs which create tire slippage will [...] "smoke the tires" [...] and as a result the race is often lost.|$|R

40|$|Component {{sound quality}} is an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. One component noise that causes complaints is the gear rattle that originates in the front-of-engine gear train which <b>drives</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> and other accessories. The rattle is caused by repeated tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the driving gears. These impacts generate a broadband, impulsive noise that is often perceived as annoying. In most previous work, the overall sound quality of diesel engines has been considered without specifically focusing on predicting the perception of gear rattle. Gear rattle level has been quantified based on angular acceleration measurements, but those measurements can be difficult to perform. Here, the emphasis was on developing a metric based on subjective testing of the perception of gear rattle. In the first part of the present work, a method to simulate gear rattle noise and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. That procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle within the total engine noise signal. The simulations were then used in a psychoacoustic test that was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increase in annoyance due to the presence of gear rattle noise. Forty subjects participated in the threshold detection tests and a paired comparison annoyance test. The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared to those of a more general population. The subjects with diesel engine experience were found to be better at detecting gear rattle noise and found rattle more annoying than the other subjects, particularly at high rattle levels. Current work is focused on development of metrics that accurately reflect human responses to gear rattle...|$|R

50|$|As engines {{moved away}} from carburetors and towards fuel injection, {{mechanical}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> were replaced with electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> because <b>fuel</b> injection systems operate more efficiently at higher fuel pressures (40-60 psi) than mechanical diaphragm pumps can generate.

50|$|In the APU, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{boosted the}} {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox.

The gearbox drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was <b>driven</b> by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
