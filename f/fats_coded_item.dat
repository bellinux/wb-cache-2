Agreement was high across the 28 items. The four raters reached consensus on 16 <b>items</b> (consensus <b>coding),</b> and three raters agreed on 22 <b>items</b> (majority <b>coding).</b> The remaining <b>items</b> were considered to substantively require both elevation and shape. To understand the effect of instruction type on item-type, items for which three or more raters agreed (majority coding) were used in the analyses (findings were substantively the same when analyses were restricted to the 16 consensus <b>coding</b> <b>items).</b> The three raters <b>coded</b> 13 <b>items</b> as elevation and nine items as shape. For ease of comparison, we conducted the item-type analyses on the proportion of items correct.|$|R

Subtopic analysis resulted {{in a total of}} 959 <b>coded</b> <b>items,</b> exclusive of gender and age variables, which were analyzed separately. It found that statements concerning the environment and ecology of children's block play accounted for 37. 12 percent, references concerning block play and school curriculum accounted for 25. 34 percent, references to block play and child development accounted for 22. 42 percent, and references to the developmental stages of children's block play accounted for 15. 12 percent of the <b>coded</b> <b>items.</b> Comparisons between the topics addressed by empirical and non-empirical studies are reviewed.

40|$|Purpose – The {{intent of}} this article is to show the direct {{outcomes}} of an inventory project, which served as the catalyst for collection development improvements. Design / methodology / approach- An inventory project was undertaken with a major emphasis on the outcomes derived from the inventory. Findings- Several types of problems were discovered, such as missing items, incorrect information (call numbers, collection <b>codes,</b> <b>item</b> types, etc…), damaged materials, and weaknesses in the collection, which resulted in major improvements and changes in the development of the collection. Originality / value- The results of the inventory project improved the accessibility of the collection to patrons by correcting many inconsistencies involving the shelving of materials, online records, call numbers, collection <b>codes,</b> <b>item</b> types, and bar codes. The location of missing items as well as identified areas of strengths and weaknesses assisted with collection development activities. The results of the project also provided an opportunity to hire a consulting firm to further assess the collection, which led to additional funds for supporting the collection. The single major benefit of the inventory process was it provided the catalyst for instigating major changes in the curriculum collection development of the Teaching Resources Center...|$|R

50|$|Idaszak and Drasgow {{provided}} a corrected {{version of the}} Job Diagnostic Survey that corrected {{for one of the}} measurement errors in the instrument. It had been suggested that reverse scoring on several of the questions was to blame for the inconsistent studies looking at the factors involved in the Job Diagnostic Survey. Following a factor analysis, Idaszak and Drasgow found six factors rather than the theorized five characteristics proposed by the Job Characteristics Theory. Upon further investigation, they were able to show that the sixth factor was made up of the reverse <b>coded</b> <b>items.</b> The authors rephrased the questions, ran the analysis again, and found it removed the measurement error.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The Cardiac Infarction Injury Score (CIIS) is an {{electrocardiogram}} {{classification system}} that was developed to identify ischaemic heart disease. As well as being of diagnostic value, the CIIS may also be of prognostic value. DESIGN [...] The prognostic value of the CIIS for mortality of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease was assessed in a 28 year follow up study of 3091 apparently healthy middle aged men and women (Dutch Civil Servants Study). RESULTS [...] The rates of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease mortality during the first 15 years of follow up were significantly higher in {{men and women with}} a CIIS of > 10 than in those with a CIIS of < or = 0 (rate ratio of coronary heart disease mortality 2. 9 (95 % confidence interval 1. 5 to 5. 8) for men and 5. 6 (2. 0 to 15. 5) for women). Coronary heart disease mortality was also higher in men with a CIIS of 1 - 10 than in men with CIIS of < or = 0. When individuals with major Minnesota <b>code</b> <b>items</b> were excluded, the associations were weaker and no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION [...] These results indicate that a high CIIS is a risk indicator for coronary heart disease mortality in the general population. Classification of electrocardiograms by means of the CIIS seems to be equivalent to classification by a combination of Minnesota <b>code</b> <b>items.</b> Because CIIS <b>coding</b> is simpler and can be performed by computer it may be more efficient than the Minnesota code for classifying cardiac injury in epidemiological studies...|$|R

40|$|This article gives {{a survey}} of the {{possible}} interpretations of word synonymy, which is relevant within the framework of a theory of denotation, but not in a theory of meaning (connotations, registers). Word synonymy dealing with <b>coded</b> <b>items</b> and sentence synonymy dealing with free items are of no interest to linguists. What allows meaning to be assessed is the coded → uncoded relation, in which the analytical uncoded item is the interpretant (Ch. S. Peirce).

40|$|In most cited food {{composition}} {{studies and}} tables, the proximate system measures protein as total nitrogen (N) (determined by Kjeldahl or Dumas method) multiplied by a specific factor. A factor of 6. 25 {{is used for}} determining total protein from total N (Jones, Munsey, & Walker, 1942). Although more expensive, it is considered more accurate to base protein content of foods on amino acid data (Greenfield & Southgate, 2003). A study on the nutrient composition of beef analysed the full amino-acid profile of fifteen retail cuts from three age groups and six <b>fat</b> <b>codes,</b> as well as determined total nitrogen content to determine proximate protein composition. For all cuts, the correlation coefficient of total amino acids to protein (N × 6. 25) was 0. 635. This indicates a poor correlation for predicting actual protein content (as determined by total amino acid count), based on the nitrogen factor of 6. 25. On average, the sum of amino acids per cut amounted to 91 % of total determined protein (N × 6. 25) for the same cut. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{investigate}} the relations among voluntary disclosure, earnings quality, {{and cost of}} capital. We find that firms with good earnings quality have more expansive voluntary disclosures (as proxied by a self-constructed index of <b>coded</b> <b>items</b> found in 677 firms' annual reports and 10 -K filings in fiscal 2001) than firms with poor earnings quality. In unconditional tests, we find that more voluntary disclosure {{is associated with a}} lower cost of capital. However, consistent with the complementary association between disclosure and earnings quality, we find that the disclosure effect on cost of capital is substantially reduced or disappears completely (depending on the cost of capital proxy) once we condition on earnings quality. Extensions probing alternative proxies show that our findings are robust to measures of earnings quality and cost of capital, but not to other measures of voluntary disclosure. In particular, we find opposite relations for voluntary disclosure measures based on management forecasts and conference calls, and we find no relations for a press release based measure.

Three cuts (shoulder, loin and leg) from the left side were cooked in order to determine the nutrient composition thereof. Nutrients showing the greatest differences between raw and cooked treatments, were protein, total fat, C 16 : 0 saturated fatty acid (SFA) and C 18 : 1 n 9 c monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). Moisture losses due to cooking resulted in an increase in the protein and cholesterol concentrations of the cooked cuts. Iron content was lower in the cooked loin cut but increased in the cooked leg cut when compared to the corresponding raw cuts. The vitamin B content of all three cooked lamb cuts was lower, although not significantly so, than that of the corresponding raw cuts.
