Greimas 2 ̆ 7 s method is using two methods, they are actancial scheme and the functional structure. The methods used to facilitate the author to determine the storyline and different points of view, so the author will know what makes Watashi interested in Rokuzoo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>life</b> from Haru no Tori.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalization}} of the Standard Model (SM) by adding two real gauge-singlets S 1, <b>S</b> 2.

They are allowed to interact with each other as well. We find that by introducing two different scalar fields, the model is less vulnerable to experimental constraints. In this paper, we consider the effects of a heavy scalar (M 1 >MH) on the electroweak phase transition. And we present configurations that produce a strong first order EWPT...|$|R
