25|$|The {{increased}} {{distance between}} the <b>downcomers</b> reduced the interaction of aerated slurry discharging from adjacent <b>downcomers.</b> This interaction could reduce overall cell recovery by causing particles collected by bubbles in the downcomer to detach in the pulp tank.|$|E
25|$|The AISE valves were {{developed}} to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual <b>downcomers</b> become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build {{up in the air}} distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the <b>downcomers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Separate <b>downcomers</b> {{were used}} by most designs, even after Yarrow's {{experiments}} had demonstrated that circulation could still take place amongst the heated tubes alone. Again, the Admiralty boiler (which omitted <b>downcomers)</b> {{was the culmination of}} this approach, placing the superheater within the tube bank, so as to encourage the necessary temperature difference.|$|E
25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the <b>downcomer</b> and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the <b>downcomer</b> is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the <b>downcomer.</b> The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the <b>downcomer,</b> meaning that the pressure inside the top of the <b>downcomer</b> is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the <b>downcomer</b> by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the <b>downcomer</b> contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the <b>downcomer</b> that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|R
40|$|Gas holdup and {{superficial}} liquid velocity in the <b>downcomer</b> and riser are {{studied for}} an external loop airlift reactor with a downcomer-to-riser area ratio of 1 : 16.

These results are compared to a bubble column operated with similar operating conditions. Gas holdup in both the riser and <b>downcomer</b> are found to increase with increasing superficial gas velocity. Results show that riser gas holdup varies slightly with <b>downcomer</b> configuration, while a considerable variation is observed for <b>downcomer</b> gas holdup.

40|$|Gas holdup and {{superficial}} liquid velocity in the <b>downcomer</b> and riser are {{studied for}} an external loop airlift reactor with an area ratio of 1 : 16. Two <b>downcomer</b> configurations are investigated {{consisting of the}} <b>downcomer</b> open or closed to the atmosphere. Experiments for these two configurations are carried out over a range of superficial gas velocities from UG = 0. 5 to 20 cm/s using three aeration plates with open area ratios of 0. 62, 0. 99 and 2. 22 %. These results are compared to a bubble column operated with similar operating conditions. Experimental {{results show that the}} gas holdup in the riser does not vary significantly with a change in the <b>downcomer</b> configuration or bubble column operation, while a considerable variation is observed in the <b>downcomer</b> gas holdup. Gas holdup in both the riser and <b>downcomer</b> are found to increase with increasing superficial gas velocity. Test results also show that the maximum gas holdup for the three aerator plates is similar, but the gas holdup trends are different. The superficial liquid velocity is found to vary considerably for the two <b>downcomer</b> configurations. However, for both cases the superficial liquid velocity {{is a function of the}} superficial gas velocity and/or the flow condition in the <b>downcomer.</b> These observed variations are independent of the aerator plate open area ratio. When the <b>downcomer</b> vent is open to the atmosphere, the superficial liquid velocity is initially observed to increase with increasing superficial gas velocity until the onset of choking occurs in the <b>downcomer.</b> Increasing the superficial gas velocity beyond the onset of choking increases the effect of choking and decreases the superficial liquid velocity. Once maximum choking is reached, the superficial liquid velocity becomes independent of the superficial gas velocity. When the <b>downcomer</b> vent is closed to the atmosphere, the superficial liquid velocity is initially observed to decrease with increasing superficial gas velocity as choking in the <b>downcomer</b> is immediately present. Once maximum choking occurs, the superficial liquid velocity once again becomes independent of the superficial gas velocity...|$|R

25|$|Three industrial-size single {{downcomer}} Jameson Cells {{were sold}} by Xstrata Technology to Shell Canada in 2007 {{for a large}} scale pilot plant project and eight 500mm <b>downcomers</b> were sold to Syncrude Limited in 2008.

25|$|Two {{additional}} Cells {{were installed}} at MIM Holdings' Collinsville Coal operations in 1990. These had 10 <b>downcomers</b> each.|$|E
25|$|The cell was 3m high, {{twice the}} height of the early Cells used in MIM's lead–zinc concentrators, as it was thought that {{additional}} residence time would enhance recovery. It used a single <b>downcomer.</b> The <b>downcomer</b> was used to contact the electrolyte with air and the droplets of the organic extractant attached themselves to the air bubbles created in the <b>downcomer.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model developed by Nellist et al. (1987) was adopted in this continuous two dimensional spouted bed dryer (2 DSB) configuration. The {{objective of this}} research was to predict air temperature, grain temperature, absolute humidity and moisture content during the drying process in 2 DSB. In simulation, spouted bed was divided into two regions which were spout and <b>downcomer</b> regions. Air and grains in spout and <b>downcomer</b> were assumed to be moving with co- and counterflow principles. During experiments, drying air temperature at 80 oC and different paddy initial moisture contents (at 41 % db, 36 % db and 30 % db) were used. Based on data, the air temperature profiles in spout region showed that air temperature dropped significantly with the axial positions while <b>downcomer</b> regions resulted fluctuated value. The average deviation of the air temperature in the spout was less than 4. 5 % and within <b>downcomer</b> was less than 4. 2 %. Grain temperature and absolute humidity in spout region increased slowly whilst decreasing in steps in <b>downcomer</b> regions with axial position. The moisture content decreased both in spouted and <b>downcomer</b> regions. Moisture reduction in spout region was higher than <b>downcomer</b> regions because of the high air flow rate in spout region...|$|R
25|$|Improvements to {{this early}} design {{included}} {{a focus on}} the weight and wear of the <b>downcomer.</b> The <b>downcomer</b> was originally built with polyurethane-lined steel, and then changed to a high-density polyethylene ("HDPE") construction with seven elements.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of this work, in 1989 MIM ordered four {{full-scale}} Cells, two for the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator and another two for the new Hilton lead–zinc concentrator to be built at the Hilton Mine, located about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa. The Mount Isa cells had diameters of 1.9m, with three <b>downcomers</b> each, while those at Hilton were 1.3m in diameter and had two <b>downcomers</b> each.|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through <b>downcomers</b> to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the <b>downcomers</b> is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the <b>downcomers</b> and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E

40|$|To {{monitor the}} gas and solid streams in a <b>downcomer</b> of a J-valve in a CFB, the {{simultaneous}} measurement technique using the oxygen gas tracer, the hot particle tracer and the pressure drop was developed. By using this novel measurement technique, the dependence of the solid flow on the gas flow in the moving bed in the <b>downcomer</b> of J-valve was investigated. The pressure profile and the pressure balance in the J-valve {{as well as the}} CFB were measured. It was clarified that the circulating mass flux in a CFB or solid flow in a J-valve was governed by the pressure drop in the <b>downcomer</b> of the J-valve. The pressure drop in the <b>downcomer</b> of the J-valve was well estimated using the modified Ergun’s equation. To quantitatively control the circulating rate of the solid particles in the CFB, the monitor and tuning of the superficial gas velocity in the <b>downcomer</b> of the J-valve was important...|$|R
40|$|The Jameson cell is a {{relatively}} new flotation device that has been successfully used in several applications, ranging from mineral recovery to de-oiling dairy effluents. The cell comprises a plunging jet bubble column (<b>downcomer)</b> which discharges in a separation tank. The effect of operating variables on Jameson cell performance, e. g., gas holdup in the <b>downcomer</b> and interaction between the <b>downcomer</b> and separation tank, was investigated in this thesis. Gas holdup in the <b>downcomer</b> of the Jameson cell was determined using conductivity measurements with ring-shaped electrodes installed in the interior wall of the <b>downcomer.</b> The Maxwell model was used to calculate the gas holdup from the conductivity measurements. In both two-phase and three-phase tests, the conductivity signal was also shown to be able to detect process disturbances (e. g., changes in flow regime). Interaction between the <b>downcomer</b> and the separation tank was studied by altering the level in the separation tank. When gas flowrate was not controlled, the level affected the gas flowrate, pressure, pool level/free jet length, mixing zone length, and gas holdup in the <b>downcomer.</b> A pressure technique was used to determine the mixing zone length. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on the froth/pulp interface position in the separation tank was also studied. Although no relationship could be drawn between gas flowrate and separation tank level, froth flooding or loss of froth interface was observed at a superficial gas rate (with respect to the separation tank) $ ge$ 1. 2 cm/s...|$|R
40|$|The <b>downcomer</b> {{for solids}} recycle {{is a key}} {{component}} in circulating fluidized beds. In the case of fast fluidization, the solids circulation rate through the <b>downcomer</b> is quite large compared with that in the conventional cyclone dipleg, resulting in {{a certain amount of}} gas flow entrained by downflow of solids, which changes the behavior of the gas-solid flow. The entrained gas flow rate in the <b>downcomer</b> incorporating a riser was determined by using a gas tracer technique. The entrained gas rates for different particle properties, solids circulation rates as well as aeration gas rates were measured and a hydrodynamic correlation was established. The transition in the flow pattern was also observed. These results are expected to provide a basis for the design of the <b>downcomer...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler {{design is}} characterised by {{its use of}} {{straight}} water-tubes, without <b>downcomers.</b> Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank.|$|E
25|$|The Jameson Cell {{has been}} adopted by Shell Canada and Syncrude for {{floating}} bitumen in the oil sands industry (see Bitumen flotation). Syncrude bought an additional eight 500mm <b>downcomers</b> for its plant in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The high {{intensity}} zone within the Jameson Cell is the <b>downcomer.</b> It is largely external and {{separated from the}} flotation tank. This, together with operation of the <b>downcomer</b> under vacuum, rather than at elevated pressure {{and the absence of}} moving parts, allows ready access to the {{high intensity}} zone for measurement and analysis. Experimentation was conducted allowing measurements of recovery for residence times of between 20 milliseconds and ten seconds within the <b>downcomer</b> of a Jameson Cell. The affect of aeration rate on the recovery of different particle sizes was also studied...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{pressurized}} water reactor (PWR), the ECCS injects liquid into the hot and/or cold leg of the reactor. The cold leg flows through a <b>downcomer</b> {{on the outside of}} the core, before flowing up through the core. The core barrel and the reactor vessel wall form a cylindrical shell that is referred to as the <b>downcomer.</b> [...] In the cold leg, boiling in the <b>downcomer</b> creates an upward flow of steam that can reverse the flow of liquid water coming in through the cold leg. The flooding rate in a PWR is pressure dependent.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler could thus {{dispense}} with separate external <b>downcomers.</b> Flow was entirely within the heated watertubes, upwards within {{those closest to}} the furnace and downwards through those in the outer rows of the bank.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, a {{full-scale}} plant was commissioned at Newlands in the 1988–89 financial year, with six rectangular Cells (1.5m × 3.5m) {{installed in a}} two-stage arrangement. The cells {{in the first stage}} had seven <b>downcomers,</b> while those in the second had six.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, flat-bottomed cell design {{to allow it to}} sit on the ground and large (500mm diameter) <b>downcomers</b> that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer.|$|E
2500|$|The slurry is {{introduced}} {{at the top}} of the <b>downcomer</b> as a jet that draws in air through a second pipe to form a stable two-phase mixture (see Figure 3). The plunging slurry jet shears and then entrains the air. The target minerals, with their collector-coated surfaces, attach to the bubbles and this mixture travels down the <b>downcomer,</b> driven by hydrostatic forces, before it is discharged into the tank portion of the Jameson Cell (see Figure 4). The <b>downcomer</b> is designed to provide high-intensity mixing of the air and the slurry to generate a dense foam of fine bubbles and maximise the contact between the target mineral particles and the bubbles. The probability of particle–bubble contact is [...] "virtually 100%" [...] with a slurry residence time in the <b>downcomer</b> of 5–10 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the hydrodynamics of an external-loop airlift membrane reactor (ELAMR). The ELAMR was operated in two modes: without (mode A) and with bubbles in the <b>downcomer</b> (mode B), depending on the liquid level in the gas separator. The influence of the gas distributor’s geometry and various alcohol solutions on the hydrodynamics of the ELAMR was studied. Results for the gas holdup and the <b>downcomer</b> liquid velocity are commented with respect to an external-loop airlift reactor of the same geometry but without the membrane in the <b>downcomer</b> (ELAR). Due to the presence of the membrane in the <b>downcomer,</b> acting as the local hydrodynamic resistance, the gas holdup in the riser of the ELAMR increases maximally by 16 %, while the liquid velocity in the <b>downcomer</b> decreases up to 50 %. The values of the gas holdup and liquid velocity predicted by the application of empirical power law correlations and a feed forward back propagation neural network (ANN) are in very good agreement with experimental values...|$|R
25|$|During this period, the orifice {{diameter}} {{was increased}} from the 28mm design used in 1990 to 34mm with the Mark II model and 38mm in 1997. This, {{together with the}} larger Mark II <b>downcomer</b> diameter, allowed the slurry flow per <b>downcomer</b> to be doubled from 30m3/h in 1990 to 60m3/h in 1997.|$|R
25|$|The {{assumption}} was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated <b>downcomers.</b> In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the steam drum to the water drum. These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them.|$|E
25|$|The {{circulation}} in a Yarrow boiler depended on a temperature {{difference between the}} inner and outer tube rows of a bank, and particularly upon the rates of boiling. Whilst this is easy to maintain at low powers, a higher pressure Yarrow boiler will tend to have less temperature difference and thus will have less effective circulation. Some later and higher-pressure boilers were fitted with external <b>downcomers,</b> outside the heated flue area.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} superheater was to increase the temperature differential between inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation. The two water drums were often linked by unheated <b>downcomers,</b> to allow this flow between the drums. This effect was later encouraged in the Admiralty boiler, where the tubes of a bank were curved apart to leave space for a superheater, whilst retaining the single water drum.|$|E
