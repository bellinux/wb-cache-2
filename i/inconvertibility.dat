An inconvertible paper which is legal tender is universally admitted to be money; in the French language the phrase papier-monnaie actually means <b>inconvertibility,</b> convertible notes being merely billets à porteur. An instrument which would be deprived of all value by the insolvency of a corporation can not be money in any sense in which money is opposed to credit.

50|$|During 1995-1998 {{monetary}} policy was highly expansionary. Net domestic credit of the National Bank of Belarus was increasing {{at the rate}} of over 100 percent from 1996 till mid-1998 as a consequence of numerous presidential decrees and resolution of the Council of Ministers instructing NBB to extend credits. Since no external sources were available for covering state budget deficit, the NBB emission activity provided its financing. Also, through authorized banks serving governmental programs, the NBB extended preferential targeted loans to state-owned enterprises. The list of credited enterprises is prepared by the government and sometimes depends on the ad-hoc strategies of development. In 2000, Belarus managed to unify its currency exchange rates, tightened its {{monetary policy}}, and partially liberalized the foreign currency market. Starting from the period of an administrative peg of the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble in 1995, the monetary policy was based on administrative regulation of interest rates. In November 1995, administrative limitations of the inter-bank credit market activity were initiated and still remain in force. In spite of the Central Bank Law passed in 1994 guaranteeing its independence, President Lukashenko has a power to nominate and dismiss the Chairman of the NBB. and to formulate monetary and foreign exchange policy. Over the past years, preferential credits, administrative price setting, and decline of the interests rate spread below 15 percentage points {{in the second quarter of}} 1997 resulted in damaging consequences to enterprises and especially banks. As the process of exhaustion of the Central Bank's hard currency reserves exhibits a dangerous tendency, government introduced restrictions on currency transactions. These have resulted in <b>inconvertibility</b> of the Belarusian ruble for the current transactions since March 1998.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Belgian {{monetary and}} exchange rate policies {{at the time}} of Bretton Woods. It sheds light on the groping adjustment process by which internal economic policies are hit by or adapt to the external constraints. In 1944, an ambitious monetary reform laid down the economic policy objectives that remained in force for two decades, namely price stability and strong currency. However, we point out different incompatibilities between these objectives and the economic context of the 1950 s and 1960 s that could have negative consequences on Belgian economic growth?. More precisely, the long lasting European currencies <b>inconvertibility</b> (1944 - 1958) contradicted the orthodox approach of the monetary policy favoured by the Central Bank. When total convertability was finally achieved, the huge increase of capital movements led to a progressive loss of the monetary policy autonomy, despite the setting up of a two-tier exchange market, which can be viewed as an institutional innovation responding to new constraints.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 157 - 165. This thesis {{analyses}} the impediments of inconvertible currencies on intra-regional trade {{within the}} Eastern and Southern African region. Currency <b>inconvertibility</b> is a non-tariff trade barrier which limits and distorts international trade expansion. Therefore, alternative arrangements {{that may be}} used in order to remedy this problem are considered. Exchange rate misalignment is identified as a major cause of currency <b>inconvertibility.</b> It is shown that the implementation of macroeconomic policies and exchange rate regimes which are not complementary cause exchange rate misalignment resulting in balance of payments disequilibria leading to currency <b>inconvertibility.</b> Since the preconditions for transformation to full currency convertibility have not been met by most countries in the region this thesis suggests a mechanism that will enable the use of local currencies for intra-regional trade (partial currency convertibility). The most viable arrangement under the prevailing conditions in the Eastern and Southern African region is the reserve fund to which member countries contribute a fraction of their international reserves. This contribution will be determined according to the levels of intra-regional trade in which they engage. This arrangement will guarantee that even if a member state cannot honour its payments' obligation {{it will be able to}} draw on the facility to make payment. The advantages of this facility are that it will guarantee that payments for intra-regional trade will be made and that the contributions by member countries will be more affordable than the other arrangements as well as its potential for assisting in creating closer economic relations in the region. The thesis concludes, however, that member countries should be encouraged to move towards full currency convertibility and hence an arrangement for purposes of intraregional currency convertibility should be strictly transitionary...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a dynamic portfolio model under currency <b>inconvertibility</b> which rationalizes the recent Egyptian experience of real exchange rate appreciation and currency diversification following {{the increase in}} oil exports and the partial financial liberalization that took place after 1976.

The effects of various official exchange rate policies on the temporary equilibrium values of the premium and the real wage and on the steady-state values of asset stocks are examined. A review of the Egyptian experience shows that as the model suggests the official devaluation of 1979 was ineffective against the "Egyptian disease" so that little can be expected from the 1981 devaluation.

40|$|Beginning in the mid- 1990 s, a {{long string}} of {{economic}} crisis brought many emerging economies to their knees. A significant factor in many of these crisis – including Mexico (1994), Thailand and Indonesia (1997), and Argentina (2002) – was an unsustainable exchange rate regime characterized by limited to no flexibility. These crisis were all asso-ciated with significant suffering and social dislocation. In response to these crises, many economists examined ways in which developing economies could protect themselves from these fluctuations. Among the policies that attracted attention were those capable of re-ducing fluctuations in the real exchange rate (capital controls or currency <b>inconvertibility</b> as in China), or avoiding a buildup in imbalances that might lead to a crisis by introducing greater flexibility into the exchange rate regime. In this paper, we seek to use standard tools from the macroeconomics literature on the welfare costs of economic fluctuations first introduced by Lucas (1987) to gauge the welfare costs of terms-of-trade fluctuations with occasional crises.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the macroeconomics of currency <b>inconvertibility,</b> {{building on the}} role of relative prices in a portfolio balance model. The relationship between black markets for foreign exchange and smuggling is first analyzed from the perspective of an individual importer. According to the portfolio view, the black market rate behaves like the financial rate in a dual market. The premium of the black marlet rate over the official rate is thus related to the probability of success in smuggling and the tariff. Then the black market is analyzed using a simple three-good,two-asset general equilibrium model. Under the assumption of regressive exchange rate expectations, the portfolio view is contrasted with a monetary approach to the black market. The short-run and long-run effects of monetary and exchange rate policies on relative prices are assessed. Different assumptions about expected returns are contrasted, but emphasis is placed on the perfect foresight case. Unless expectations are static, official exchange rate policy has to adjust to the private valuation of foreign exchange, as stressed in the conclusion. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{function of}} the α-inc allele (an α mating-type allele that is insensitive to the {{function of the}} homothallic gene system) was investigated by means of protoplast fusion. The fusion of protoplasts prepared from haploid strains of α-inc HO HMα HMa and α ho hmα HMa gave rise mainly to nonmating clones (58 of 64 isolates) and a few clones (six of 64 isolates) showing α mating type. Thirty of the 58 nonmating clones showed the diploid cell size and 28 clones had a larger cell size. Tetrad analysis of the nonmating clones with diploid cell size indicated that they were a/α-inc diploid; the normal α allele in α/α-inc cells was preferentially switched to an a allele. This observation further indicated that the HO/ho HMα/hmα HMa/HMa genotype is effective for the conversion of the α to a and that the <b>inconvertibility</b> of the α-inc allele is due to the insensitivity of the mating-type allele to the functional combination of the homothallic genes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we chart the {{geography}} of the gold standard. We highlight the late date of the move to gold and the variety of transition strategies. Whether {{a country with a}} currency convertible into specie operated a gold, silver or bimetallic standard at mid-century depended not so much on whether it was rich or poor as on the monetary standard of the foreign country or countries to which its transactions were linked. When it came to the distinction between specie convertibility and <b>inconvertibility,</b> however, domestic economic conditions came into play. In particular, there was a strong correlation between economic development, as proxied by the level of per capita incomes, and possession of a convertible currency. Most countries went onto the gold standard between the 1870 s and {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century. We enumerate the factors propelling this transition and analyse variations in its timing. Factors shaping the course of this transition include the level of economic development, the magnitude of reserves relative to world specie markets, whether reserves were concentrated at the central bank, and the presence or absence of imperial ties.
