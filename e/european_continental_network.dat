5000|$|Scheidt & Bachmann had {{initially}} gained {{experience in the}} design and manufacture of self-service ticket machines during the 1990s when the FAA-2000 system, popular on <b>continental</b> <b>European</b> railway <b>networks,</b> was developed. [...] By the early 2000s a refined design, marketed as FAA-2000/TS, had been launched. Its modern touch-screen technology, flexible and easily customisable interface and ability to accept cash or card payments made it a popular choice with transport operators in urban areas including Boston, New York City, Seattle, Cologne, Copenhagen and Dublin. [...] A version of this newer design with the codename FAA-2000/TS (ATOC) was put on trial in August 2003 at Twickenham, a South West Trains station. In conjunction with the redesign and rebuilding of the station forecourt area, two Ticket XPress machines—numbered 2000 and 2001—were built into a wall next to the main station entrance.|$|R
