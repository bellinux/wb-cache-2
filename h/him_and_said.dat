5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> Garza admitted {{he had received}} US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

25|$|Vance asked Davidson to {{describe}} his fictitious band and their music. Initially, Davidson said that the Cruisers sounded like Dion and the Belmonts, but when they meet Frank, they have elements of Jim Morrison and The Doors. However, Davidson {{did not want to}} {{lose sight of the fact}} that the Cruisers were essentially a Jersey bar band, and he thought of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The filmmaker told Vance to find him someone that could produce music that contained elements of these three bands. Davidson was getting close to rehearsals when Vance called <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he had found the band--John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band from Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|At the Committee of Imperial Defence meeting {{after the}} Agadir Crisis the First Sea Lord Admiral Arthur Wilson {{said that in}} the event of war the Navy planned to land the Army on the Baltic Coast. Nicholson asked Wilson whether the Admiralty had maps of German {{strategic}} railways (to show how the Germans could rush reinforcements to invasion spots), and when Wilson said it was not the Admiralty’s business to have such maps, Nicholson openly rebuked <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that if the Navy “meddled” in military matters they needed not just to have such maps but to have studied them. Prime Minister H.H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army’s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France.|$|E
25|$|Delbono {{was forced}} to {{announce}} his resignation as mayor on 25 January 2010 following the revelation {{that he was being}} investigated for crimes such as embezzlement, fraud and aggravated abuse of office. The investigation followed Delbono's former assistant's claim that he had spent public money on her the pair had been having an affair. Investigators subsequently questioned Delbono about the purchase of a property near St. Julian's, Malta. Delbono denied all the allegations made against <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that resigning as mayor {{was the right thing to}} do. He has announced that he will return to lecturing and is working to clear his name. His resignation was confirmed on 28 January following the approval of an emergency budget, the election to appoint Delbono's successor must take place by 28 March 2010.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1997, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Edward Ferns sentenced 28-year-old Anthony Gabriel Rodriguez, 22-year-old Manuel Rosales, Jr., and 18-year-old Hugo David Gomez to 54 {{years and}} eight months {{to life in}} state prison. At that point, 17-year-old Augustin Lizama was to be retried. During the {{sentencing}} of the three convicted murderers, Margaret Fregoso, Rodriguez's grandmother, defended <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that people outside of the court speculated that the Kuhen automobile traveled through the neighborhood so one or more occupants could purchase recreational drugs. Robynn Kuhen, the mother of Stephanie Kuhen, said that her family {{was trying to find}} a shortcut home and said that Fregoso's statements were not true. The defense in the trial suggested that the Kuhen family knew the layout of the area and would not have found themselves lost in their car. On Friday, August 29, 1997, Lizama agreed to a plea bargain in which he received a conviction for assault.|$|E

25|$|For years, Watterson battled against {{pressure}} from publishers to merchandise his work, {{something that he}} felt would cheapen his comic. He refused to merchandise his creations {{on the grounds that}} displaying Calvin and Hobbes images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue Calvin and Hobbes with a new artist. Watterson's position eventually won out {{and he was able to}} renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.|$|E

500|$|One {{example of}} his dogged pursuit of {{excellence}} is that while in high school, Scheyer refused to leave the gym one night until he made 50 consecutive free throws.

He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E

[...] Maeser responded [...] "no such thing, it's only the building .... The academy lives on." [...] Maeser turned the devastating fire into a lesson on pride. He had a dream that inspired the construction of new buildings for the Academy. The school struggled financially for some time, and Maeser pondered going elsewhere. He had a dream, or what he called a vision, in which he saw [...] "Temple Hill filled with buildings—great temples of learning," [...] which inspired him to stay at the Academy.|$|E

Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel in front of police officers. Several Arsenal players were held back, one of whom was Henry, incensed that Ferdinand claimed the man-of-the-match award.

Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No, it's been changed. We're going this way."

500|$|The {{book has}} been seen as widely {{influential}} within the genre of fantasy. Margaret Atwood has called A Wizard of Earthsea one of the [...] "wellsprings" [...] of fantasy literature, illustrating Le Guin's influence within the genre. A Wizard of Earthsea has been compared to major works of high fantasy such as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The notion that names can exert power is also present in Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away; critics have suggested that that idea originated with Le Guin's Earthsea series. Novelist David Mitchell, author of books such as Cloud Atlas, described A Wizard of Earthsea as having a strong influence on <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that he felt a desire to [...] "wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin".|$|E
