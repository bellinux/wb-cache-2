25|$|The first {{offshore}} wells {{drilled in}} the Beaufort used artificial islands as drilling platforms, {{but this was}} a winter drilling system, and was only practical in shallow water. In the mid-1970s, the introduction of a fleet of reinforced drillships extended the drilling season to include the 90 to 120 ice-free days of summer. This also enabled the industry to drill in the deeper waters of the Beaufort Sea. By the mid-1980s, variations on artificial island and <b>drilling</b> <b>vessel</b> technologies had extended both the drilling season and the depth of water at which the industry could operate. They had also reduced exploration costs.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} with a scaled pilot facility {{were carried out}} to compare the relative bulk transfer performance of three special devices for applications to drilling systems.

40|$|Abstract only availableThis {{project is}} aimed at {{creating}} a high pressure consolidation device that will successfully measure consolidation properties of sediment samples taken from the Nankai Trench {{off the coast of}} Japan. The main difference between the proposed device and current consolidation devices are the pressure range and cross-sectional area of the machine. An improved consolidation device would allow for more accurate results as the pressure would be closer to that at the ocean's floor, and sample sizes could be much larger due to the larger area of the loading apparatus. This consolidation device could also be used on the deep-sea <b>drilling</b> <b>vessels</b> that produce these samples, and consolidation tests could begin immediately after drilling, rather than months later. The development of a high pressure testing apparatus could measure consolidation properties of deep-sea sediments more accurately than any currently used consolidation device.
