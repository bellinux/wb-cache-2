40|$|The article {{examines}} the role and employment of the public-policy exception in private international law {{from the perspective of}} the law applicable to contractual obligations. To begin with, prerequisites for recourse to the public-policy clause are investigated, to illustrate why this <b>exceptional</b> <b>clause</b> is likely to come into play rather infrequently, as indeed should be the case. The article then analyses the relativity of ordre public, exploring three dimensions to be considered in the courts’ use of the public-policy exception in a particular case. In summary, the author concludes that, notwithstanding its highly restrictive application criteria and, therefore, infrequent application, dispensing with the public-policy exception would be unthinkable even within the domain of international contracts. The regulation of public policy in the Rome I Regulation constitutes an abstract and flexible instrument, thereby allowing appropriate response to the issues of a changing society...|$|E
40|$|In a contract, <b>exceptional</b> <b>clauses</b> specify {{sanctions}} {{that come in}} force when the primary obligations are not fulfilled. An important aspect of exception handling is their resolution: determining which particular exception clause should be enforced when a violation is detected. This paper presents a specification and resolution technique for electronic contracts {{that can be used}} by a third party exception resolution service. © 2009 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

40|$|Most Favoured Nations {{principle}} {{require the}} WTO members {{for not doing}} discrimination to products from other WTO members for both tariff bound products and non tariff bound products. This principle {{is the heart of}} GAIT, GATS dan TR/Ps. Thing that relevant in term of implementation of the principle is like product application which is examined in certain cases either in the panel level or in the Appelate Body level. Nevertheless, there are <b>exceptional</b> <b>clauses</b> for not applying the principle. They are Article XX, XX/, XXIV dan XXV(5) in which Article XX(b) and (g) are often used by WTO members as a reasonable grounds to protect human, animal, plant life or health and to protect exhaustable natura...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} how the EU {{legal order}} deals with cases where Member States deem that {{the principle of}} necessity justifies a deviation from EU law. It analyses the various <b>exceptional</b> <b>clauses</b> laid down in primary and secondary EU law, and discusses the tensions which their application may raise {{in the context of}} the Union’s idiosyncratic constitutional order. It assesses the broad powers with which national courts are endowed, and highlights the dynamic nature of the Union’s approach to accommodating potential deviations. Finally, it focuses on an area at the core of national sovereignty, namely defence, and outlines the gradually shifting approach to its economic aspects which the Union institutions have developed over the years...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{starts with}} {{reviewing}} the debates on patent in access to medicines {{in the context}} of globalization of TRIPS regime. It then looks at the issue of resistance related to patent theories, mechanism and the linkage with social movement during law reform processes. Accordingly, the 2005 revision of Patent Act in India and the 2008 revision of Patent Law in China are chosen as the backdrops for comparison. The choice of patentability doctrine and the <b>exceptional</b> <b>clauses</b> to promote research use would be the major aspects of comparison, both having been influenced by civil society actions at different degrees in both countries. The paper intends to draw the conclusions that while strong technocratic influences remain, both countries’ law makers have started walking out of the closed discourse of patent law reform via interacting with societal concerns {{in the context of}} improving access to medicines...|$|R
25|$|The 1998 {{redevelopment}} caused controversy {{when the}} club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat prices would be increased to corporate rates, with {{the option of}} paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections. Half of these fans were 'bondholders', who had paid £500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years. Some fans resisted, and after two high-court cases and a Save Our Seats campaign, the club was allowed to move the fans, under an <b>exceptional</b> circumstances <b>clause.</b> As a gesture of goodwill, the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit.|$|R
50|$|Inversion in Old English {{sentences}} with {{a combination}} of two verbs could be described in terms of their finite and non-finite forms. The word which participated in inversion was the finite verb; the verb which retained its position relative to the Object was the non-finite verb. In most types of Modern English clause, there are two verb forms, but the verbs are considered to belong to different syntactic classes. The verbs which participated in inversion have evolved to form a class of auxiliary verbs which may mark tense, aspect and mood; the remaining majority of verbs with full semantic value are said to constitute the class of lexical verbs. The <b>exceptional</b> type of <b>clause</b> is that of declarative clause with a lexical verb in a Present simple or Past simple form.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{variation and}} change in Old English word order from the ninth century {{to the beginning of}} the twelfth century, with special emphasis on the position of the verb. It is demonstrated that variation in surface word order is primarily a reflex of synchronic variation in underlying phrase structure. ^ A structural analysis of Old English syntax is presented, and it is argued that variation in the surface position of the inflected verb is best explained by the hypothesis of alternating INFL-medial and INFL-final phrase structure, with obligatory transformational movement of the verb to INFL. This variation in underlying structure exists not only at the level of the speech community, but also within the usage of individuals. It is shown that in the general case, the verb-second phenomenon in Old English reflects verb movement to clause-medial INFL in both matrix and subordinate clauses, rather than verb movement to COMP limited to matrix clauses, as in Modern German and Dutch. In addition, evidence is provided for alternating OV and VO phrase structure during the Old English period. Verb movement to INFL, together with processes of postposition, syntactic cliticization of both pronouns and adverbs, verb (projection) raising, and further verb movement from INFL to COMP in a restricted set of <b>exceptional</b> matrix <b>clause</b> types, derives the attested word order patterns of Old English. The results of a quantitative study of the underlying position of INFL demonstrate that the frequency of INFL-medial phrase structure increases during the Old English period at the same rate in both matrix and subordinate clauses, supporting the hypothesis of identical structures and processes in the two clause types. Finally, the above analysis of Old English is used as a basis for suggesting the nature of the syntactic changes that occur during the Middle English period. ...|$|R
