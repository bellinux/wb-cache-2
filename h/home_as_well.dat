5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds {{as indicators of}} both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall.

Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Since 1905, Windsor Park {{in south}} Belfast has been Linfield's home ground. In the initial {{years after the}} club was formed in 1886, Linfield had to change grounds several times for various reasons such as housing development.
