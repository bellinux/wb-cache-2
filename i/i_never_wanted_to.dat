They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, [...] "I remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me—just her tone. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be {{on the wrong side}} of her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so at the time of the Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E

[...] Shortly after, she comments that [...] "For me, the movement {{needs to be}} something bigger than just a record. For me, a movement is something that represents, like, taking over the world." [...] Cyrus notably avoids specifically naming her former television series Hannah Montana, instead calling it [...] "my show" [...] when flashback pictures of her earlier career was shown, presumably to distance herself from the franchise. However, she commented that after its conclusion [...] "I made one movie, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it again. I want to make music {{for the rest of}} my life."

Slant Magazine listed [...] "Secret" [...] as the 42nd [...] "Best Singles of the 1990s", stating that its [...] "one of the most organic-sounding singles of Madonna's career, taking its sweet time to get where it's going and not giving up too much along the way. The arrangement gets off on being withholding, and, at least for one glorious single, so does Madonna: When she sings, [...] "You knew all along/What <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] she sounds positively rapturous. Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 30 on his list of [...] "Best Madonna Songs", stating [...] "its slinky R groove made 'Secret' something special, even if it's not remembered for an accompanying scandal or bawdy 'moment'. We {{like to talk about}} her ability to produce controversy and headlines, {{but at the end of}} the day, here's what Madonna makes best: pop music". Louis Virtel of The Backlot listed the song at number 14 on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", calling it [...] "meditative, moving" [...] and [...] "sexy as hell". Rooksby concurred that [...] "its a good track" [...] but felt that the time could have been reduced from five minutes, which made it a little long.

500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by David Fincher and filmed in April 1989, at Culver Studios in Culver City, California. It was produced by Gregg Fienberg, under Propaganda Films, with editing by Scott Chestnut, principal photography by Mark Plummer, and Vance Lorenzini as the production designer. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] music video {{was inspired by the}} Fritz Lang classic film Metropolis (1927), and featured an epigraph {{at the end of the}} video from the film: [...] "Without the Heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind". The video marked the first appearance of the Shep Pettibone remix of the song. It had a total budget of $5million ($ million in [...] dollars), which made it the most expensive music video in history at the time it was made, and currently the third most expensive of all time. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] had its world-premiere on May 17, 1989, on MTV and was an MTV exclusive for three weeks, being aired every hour on the music channel. The concept of the video was to portray Madonna as a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them—played by model Cameron Alborzian—as her date. When Fincher explained this concept to Madonna, she was intrigued and decided to portray a masculine persona. She was dating actor Warren Beatty at that time, and asked him to play the part of a slave working at a factory; Beatty politely refused, saying later that [...] "Madonna wanted the video as a show case of her sexual prowess, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a part of it." [...] She then thought about Metropolis and of its scenes displaying factory workers and a city with tall skyscrapers. Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In Madonna 'Talking': Madonna in Her Own Words, she commented about the development of the video.|$|E
