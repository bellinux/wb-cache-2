40|$|There is {{considerable}} diversity among <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> and program availability in the United States.

The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs".

40|$|The {{identification}} of gifted African American students {{is one of}} the most pressing issues in gifted education. According to national statistics, African American children comprise 17 % of total public school enrollment, yet only 8. 4 % of all children served in <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> were African American. Thus for every 200 students from the total public school enrollment, there will be approximately 1 African American student represented in <b>gifted</b> <b>programs,</b> underscoring the critical need for authentic and appropriate identification instruments and systems for these children. ^ Underrepresentation of racial or ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged children in <b>programs</b> for <b>gifted</b> students has not changed considerably in public schools over the last 4 decades. Among the many factors that contribute to the lack of {{identification of}} gifted African American youngsters, the one most commonly cited by researchers concerns the construct of giftedness as defined by intelligence and other standardized tests. The use of an IQ or standardized ability test as the primary means for the nomination and placement of children in <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> has not effectively facilitated the identification of students from economically disadvantaged background or those representing culturally diverse populations. Therefore, researchers are currently reexamining identification procedures to include multiple sources and criteria. Improving the process of identification for populations traditionally underrepresented in <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> will facilitate access to educational services and programs that will appropriately foster the talents of these children. ^ This qualitative study identified the characteristics of high ability African American urban elementary students as these traits were manifested in the home, school, and community environments.

40|$|In three {{different}} studies {{upper secondary school}} head teachers’ characterization and identification of mathematical giftedness was investigated. A survey study (Paper II) explored the conceptions held by 36 randomly selected upper secondary school head teachers in mathematics. An interview study (Paper III) investigated the conceptions held by three purposively selected head teachers working at the longest running <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> in mathematics in Swedish upper secondary schools. A third study (Paper IV) looked for creativity, the characteristic head teachers’ most frequently associated with giftedness, in the admission tests used at the cutting-edge programs in mathematics in upper secondary school. As compared to theoretical models, {{results showed that the}} head teachers collectively expressed nuanced characterizations of mathematical giftedness and the identification thereof. This was especially demonstrated by the head teachers at the <b>gifted</b> mathematics <b>programs.</b> Still, for individual head teachers, {{there is a need to}} further their knowledge about the different abilities contributing to manifestations of mathematical giftedness. This would increase the possibility to identify and develop the mathematical abilities of an even greater number of mathematically promising students. Krutetskii’s (1976) structure of mathematical abilities manifested by capable mathematics students was used as a framework for the content analysis in the first two studies, and Lithner’s (2008) framework for creative and imitative reasoning was used in the third study. In a fourth study (Paper V) the representation of different student groups at five purposively selected <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> in upper secondary school was investigated. Findings from this comparative study of demographical factors – gender, geographical origin, and highest education of parents – were complemented by findings from the interview study where the cognitive, as well as personal and social, characteristics of students participating at three <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> were expressed. Results from the interview study indicated that students participating at the <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> showed signs of mathematical giftedness that are not necessarily connected to schoolhouse giftedness. Both mathematically gifted students who were individualists and reluctant to participate in traditional school mathematics, and those who were hardworking and ambitious, were recognized. Participating students had special needs, such as to approach mathematical tasks in their own way and learn how to communicate mathematics in written solutions, connected to their giftedness that call for special education. The demographical study showed that it is mostly males with highly educated parents who have found their way to <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> in mathematics. In sum, results indicate that the head teachers at the <b>gifted</b> <b>programs</b> acknowledge that there are gifted mathematics students with special educational needs at their <b>gifted</b> <b>programs.</b> There is also a call for the development of complementary educational activities to reach a greater number and variety of gifted students...|$|R
