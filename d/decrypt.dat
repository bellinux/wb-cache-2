5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a proof of concept, BackupHDDVD is severely limited in its ability to produce fully functional copies of commercial discs. Early versions were unable to properly <b>decrypt</b> discs which used the in-movie experience technology. New versions work around this limitation by excluding interactive content from decrypted copies. The utility cannot process HD DVD navigation functionality which enables menus, chapters, secondary audio tracks and subtitles, so these features are inaccessible in copies created by BackupHDDVD. Most versions provide no validation for keys and will still attempt to <b>decrypt</b> a disc's contents with an incorrect key, resulting in corrupt files.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to <b>decrypt</b> files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help <b>decrypt</b> files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E
50|$|Decryption {{requires}} <b>decrypting</b> {{the final}} block first, then restoring the stolen ciphertext to the penultimate block, which canthen be <b>decrypted</b> as usual.|$|R

5|$|An attack {{may also}} reveal private keys of {{compromised}} parties, which would enable attackers to <b>decrypt</b> communications (future or past stored traffic captured via passive eavesdropping, unless perfect forward secrecy is used, {{in which case}} only future traffic can be decrypted if intercepted via man-in-the-middle attacks).|$|E
5|$|Proponents of Magic Lantern {{argue the}} {{technology}} would allow {{law enforcement to}} efficiently and quickly <b>decrypt</b> messages protected by encryption schemes. Unlike a predecessor, Carnivore, implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, which would necessitate a court order.|$|E
5|$|The AACS LA {{announced}} on April 16 {{that it had}} revoked the decryption keys associated with certain software high-definition DVD players, which {{will not be able}} to <b>decrypt</b> AACS encrypted disks mastered after April 23, without an update of the software.|$|E
50|$|When PURPLE {{was broken}} by the U.S. Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS), several {{problems}} arose for the Americans: who would get the <b>decrypts,</b> which <b>decrypts,</b> how often, under what circumstances, and crucially (given interservice rivalries) who would do the delivering. Both the U.S. Navy and Army were insistent they alone handle all <b>decrypted</b> traffic delivery, especially to highly placed policy makers in the U.S. Eventually, after much toing and froing, a compromise was reached: the Army {{would be responsible for}} the <b>decrypts</b> on one day, and the Navy the next.|$|R

5|$|Written by an {{anonymous}} programmer using the handle Muslix64, BackupHDDVD is distributed {{with none of}} the cryptographic keys necessary for decryption. Users wanting to use the software to <b>decrypt</b> a protected disc's contents must obtain the appropriate keys separately, a task with which neither the original author nor his or her versions of BackupHDDVD assist.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to <b>decrypt</b> a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to <b>decrypt</b> the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2006, {{a person}} using the alias muslix64 {{published}} a utility named BackupHDDVD and its source code on the DVD decryption forum at the website Doom9. BackupHDDVD {{can be used}} to <b>decrypt</b> AACS protected content once one knows the encryption key. muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them is not difficult.|$|E
50|$|A secure {{cryptoprocessor}} is {{a dedicated}} computer on a chip or microprocessor {{for carrying out}} cryptographic operations, embedded in a packaging with multiple physical security measures, which give it a degree of tamper resistance. Unlike cryptographic processors that output <b>decrypted</b> data onto a bus in a secure environment, a secure cryptoprocessor does not output <b>decrypted</b> data or <b>decrypted</b> program instructions {{in an environment where}} security cannot always be maintained.|$|R
50|$|Axis {{occupation}} {{forces in}} Yugoslavia used radio communication extensively. In addition to German Abwehr, Sicherheitsdienst, Luftwaffe, Naval, railway, Army group and High Command messages, GC&CS intercepted and <b>decrypted</b> Yugoslav partisan communications with Comintern {{and with the}} Soviet Union. Cairncross first in Hut 3, then later at MI6 HQ, had access to raw <b>decrypts.</b> Communications from Comintern to Tito supplying some of this intelligence strongly suggests that he passed <b>decrypts</b> concerning Yugoslavia to the KGB.|$|R
50|$|Central Bureau at 21 Henry Street, Ascot, in Brisbane <b>decrypted</b> a Japanese Army Air/Ground signal {{intercepted by}} 51 Wireless Section in Darwin that {{contained}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's itinerary {{for an upcoming}} trip to Rabaul. Admiral Yamamoto, was the Commander in Chief of the Combined Japanese Fleet, {{the architect of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor. Central Bureau reportedly sent the <b>decrypted</b> message to FRUMEL where it was reportedly translated by a U.S. Navy linguist. Although Central Bureau may have <b>decrypted</b> the message, the interception of his flight was based on <b>decrypts</b> of Japanese naval messages by FRUPAC/Station HYPO in Hawaii, FRUMEL, OP-20-G in Washington and Station AL on Guadalcanal. Major Lasswell USMC in Hawaii <b>decrypted</b> the Japanese Naval message first and Captain Layton (Pacific Fleet Intelligence in Hawaii) gave it to Admiral Nimitz who authorized a shootdown attempt after determining from ComNavAirSoPac that it could be done with by one of his Army Air Corp units on Guadalcanal.|$|R
5|$|To <b>decrypt</b> Enigma messages, {{three pieces}} of {{information}} were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and <b>decrypt</b> all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can <b>decrypt</b> the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
25|$|Files and folders are <b>decrypted</b> {{before being}} copied to a volume {{formatted}} with another file system, like FAT32. Finally, when encrypted files are copied over the network using the SMB/CIFS protocol, the files are <b>decrypted</b> {{before they are}} sent over the network.|$|R
50|$|The {{messages}} were <b>decrypted</b> by a PURPLE analogue machine at OP-20-G and {{passed to the}} SIS for translation from Japanese, early {{on the morning of}} December 7. Army Colonel Rufus S. Bratton and Navy Lieutenant Commander Alvin Kramer independently inspected the <b>decrypts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Russian {{text of the}} Cyrillic Projector {{was finally}} <b>decrypted</b> and {{translated}} in English in 2003 after Elonka Dunin [...] "led the charge", with the ciphertext independently <b>decrypted</b> by Frank Corr and Mike Bales, and plaintext translation from Russian provided by Dunin.|$|R
5|$|This {{equation}} can {{be solved}} by the Euclidean algorithm, as described above. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the RSA algorithm, which is widely used in electronic commerce; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to <b>decrypt</b> the message. Note that although the RSA algorithm uses rings rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error-correcting codes; for example, {{it can be used}} {{as an alternative to the}} Berlekamp–Massey algorithm for decoding BCH and Reed–Solomon codes, which are based on Galois fields.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{continues}} to struggle in deciphering an encrypted Starfleet {{message that they}} previously obtained through the Hirogen relay system (""). Neelix (Ethan Phillips) returns to Voyager with a guest, Arturis (Ray Wise), who helped him obtain supplies. Arturis learns of the encoded message and offers to help <b>decrypt</b> it. He is successful, and finds that the message is from Starfleet Command, with a nearby set of coordinates where their means of getting back home can be found. Though {{the rest of the}} crew is elated at this news, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) remains cautious, given that the Borg have never been able to assimilate Arturis' species. Voyager arrives at the provided coordinates to find an unmanned Starfleet vessel, the Dauntless, of unknown design. Aboard, they find the ship uses quantum slipstream technology, which will allow them to arrive back in the Alpha Quadrant within a few months.|$|E
5|$|In the Baltic, Magdeburg {{fired the}} first {{shots of the}} war against the Russians on 2 August, when she shelled the port of Libau. She participated in a series of bombardments of Russian {{positions}} until late August. On the 26th, she participated in a sweep of the entrance to the Gulf of Finland; while steaming off the Estonian coast, she ran aground off the island of Odensholm and could not be freed. A pair of Russian cruisers appeared and seized the ship. Fifteen crew members were killed in the brief engagement. They recovered three intact German code books, one of which they passed to the British. The ability to <b>decrypt</b> German wireless signals provided the British with the ability to ambush German units on several occasions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland. The Russians partially scrapped Magdeburg while she remained grounded before completely destroying the wreck.|$|E
30|$|Our {{experiments}} {{show that}} the quality of <b>decrypted</b> regions is good for H. 264 encoded videos with QP of up to 26. The same set of experiments were repeated and the upper bounds for QP to ensure acceptable quality for <b>decrypted</b> regions is QP of 6 for H. 263 and MPEG- 4 and 3 [*]Mbps for MPEG- 2. The experiments {{show that the}} video has to be recorded with good quality in order to preserve the quality of <b>decrypted</b> regions.|$|R
30|$|False {{acceptance}} rate and error rejection rate: The false {{acceptance rate}} (FAR) is {{the probability that}} the wrong key correctly <b>decrypts</b> the original image.

50|$|Each file is {{encrypted}} in blocks, {{and this}} option controls what size those blocks are. Each time a single byte is read the entire block it {{is contained in}} must be <b>decrypted.</b> Likewise, for each write the block must be <b>decrypted,</b> altered, and re-encrypted.|$|R
5|$|On December 18, 2006, a video {{which showed}} BackupHDDVD {{being used to}} <b>decrypt</b> and copy the film Full Metal Jacket to a hard drive was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. Two days after the video was uploaded, the initial version of the utility along with its source code and documentation was uploaded to a file hosting service. A link to the file was then posted by the utility's creator on the forums of Doom9, a website devoted to DVD backup. The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained. The author elaborated in another forum post, claiming that keys could be obtained by exploiting the necessity {{for them to be}} held in memory to allow playback in player software.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to <b>decrypt</b> them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these keys. The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to <b>decrypt</b> the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E
