25|$|Typically not {{diagnosed}} {{until late}} childhood or later, Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome usually presents {{itself with a}} combination of central nervous system features (midbrain), ophthalmic features (retina), and facial features. The degree of expression of the syndrome's components varies both clinically and structurally. Common symptoms that lead to diagnosis are headaches, retro-orbital pain and <b>hemianopia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ophthalmic}} {{features of}} the Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome occur as retinal arteriovenous malformation (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs that are categorized depending on {{the severity of the}} malformation. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient’s malformation is missing a connecting capillary. The missing capillary is meant to serve as a link between an artery and a vein; without it, edemas, hemorrhages, and visual impairments can result. Category three, the most severe, occurs when the patient’s malformations are so severe that the dilated vessels cause no distinction between artery and vein. When the symptoms are this severe, the patient has a significantly increased risk of developing vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions cause a wide range of symptoms including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic degeneration and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous <b>hemianopia.</b> Homonymous <b>hemianopia</b> typically presents unilaterally, but bilateral cases have been reported as well.|$|E
2500|$|When Cushing's {{syndrome}} is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offers equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates {{the effects of}} cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50 nmol/l (1.81µg/dl) would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late-night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels {{may need to be}} ascertained. [...] Performing a physical examination to determine any visual field defect may be necessary if a pituitary lesion is suspected, which may compress the optic chiasm, causing typical bitemporal <b>hemianopia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} ability of the {{multifocal}} pattern visual evoked potential (mVEP) to detect field loss in neurological lesions affecting the visual pathway from the chiasm to the cortex. Method: The mVEPs recorded in the clinic were retrospectively reviewed for any cases involving central neurological lesions. Recordings had been performed with the AccuMap V 1. 3 objective perimeter, which used an array of four bipolar occipital electrodes to provide four differently oriented channels for simultaneous recording. 19 patients with <b>hemianopias</b> were identified. Of these there were 10 homonymous <b>hemianopias</b> with hemifield type loss, two bitemporal <b>hemianopias,</b> and seven homonymous <b>hemianopias</b> with quadrantanopic distribution. A comparison with subjective field results and CT/MRI findings was done to determine the relation between the two methods of visual field mapping and any relation with the anatomical location of the lesion and the mVEP results. Results: In all hemianopic type cases (12) the defect was demonstrated on the mVEP and showed good correspondence in location of the scotoma (nine homonymous and two bitemporal). The topographic distribution was similar but not identical to subjective testing. Of the seven quadrantanopic type <b>hemianopias,</b> only four were found to have corresponding mVEP losses in the same areas. In the three cases where the mVEP was normal, the type of quadrantanopia had features consistent with an extra-striate lesion being very congruous, complete, and respecting the horizontal meridian. Conclusions: The mVEP can detect field loss from cortical lesions, but not in some cases of homonymous quadrantanopia, where the lesion may have been in the extra-striate cortex. This supports the concept that the mVEP is generated in V 1 striate cortex and that it may be able to distinguish striate from extra-striate lesions. It implies caution should be used when interpreting “functional” loss using the mVEP if the visual field pattern is quadrantic. 6 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Prompt visual {{recovery}} {{is usually the}} norm with immediate administration of systemic steroid therapy [46, 53, 54]. Among the optic neuritis patients, 36 % of cases had simultaneous systemic and ocular manifestations, suggesting direct involvement of the virus [53]. Other neurological signs reported are bilateral external ophthalmoplegia, incongruous homonymous <b>hemianopias</b> [54] suggestive of optic tract lesions, and upper motor neuron facial palsy. Some other rare ocular manifestations that have been reported include exudative retinal detachment and central retinal artery occlusion [49].|$|R

40|$|Quantitative perimetric {{studies in}} two {{patients}} with involvement of a {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (caused by astrocytoma in one and a small arteriovenous malformation in the other) revealed strikingly incongruous defects in the contralateral homonymous fields of vision. The patterns of these <b>hemianopias</b> were analysed and correlated anatomically in terms of established patterns of retinal projections within the six cellular laminae of the geniculate nucleus. Incongruous wedge-shaped field defects recorded in the patient with the astrocytoma are unique and appear to be pathognomonic of focal geniculate disease in the dorsal crest of the nucleus...|$|R
30|$|A kind of “controlled perimetry of the fundus” is also possible, e.g., {{the small}} semi-circle will {{disappear}} when projected onto the optic disc (see Figure  5). Since {{the projection of}} the Goldmann V-stimulus on the fundus is {{much smaller than the}} “small semi-circle” this method can be applied as a broad assessment only of e.g. <b>hemianopias.</b> For the examiner, however, the illuminated area, appears at a uniform level of brightness, which can be modulated by the slit lamp potentiometer. Outside this area the non illuminated fundus structures are practically invisible, which hampers orientation on the retina.|$|R

Most had localised low density lesions withing {{the distribution of the}} posterior cerebral artery. The location of the lesion (deduced from a separate anatomical study of postmortem brain cut in the plane of the CAT scanner) was correlated with visual field defects. Lesions giving rise to quadrantic defects were smaller than those causing total hemianopias; lower quadrantic defects tended to occur in superior cuts and vice versa. Macular sparing was associated with survival of the occipital pole in some instances. Bilateral cases had a higher prevalence of associated defects...|$|R

40|$|The 4 -m {{confrontation}} {{visual field}} test {{has been successfully}} used at the Mayo Clinic {{for many years in}} addition to the standard 0. 5 -m confrontation visual field test. The 4 -m confrontation visual field test is a test of macular function and can identify small central or paracentral scotomas that the examiner may not find when the patient is tested only at 0. 5 m. Also, macular sparing in homonymous <b>hemianopias</b> and quadrantanopias may be identified with the 4 -m confrontation visual field test. We recommend use of this confrontation visual field test, in addition to the standard 0. 5 -m confrontation visual field test, on appropriately selected patients to obtain the most information possible by confrontation visual field tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{consistency}} of the major positive component (P 100) of the full-field pattern-reversal response provides a clinically valuable and objective means of detecting visual field defects. Its normally symmetrical distribution about the midline of the occipital scalp results from the summation of two highly asymmetric half-field responses, each of which shows the positive component well lateralised with a widespread distribution on the ipsilateral side. Stimulation of each eye in patients with bitemporal and homonymous <b>hemianopias</b> results in two characteristic patterns of asymmetry, named 'crossed' and 'uncrossed' respectively, in which the major positivity is consistently recorded on the side ipsilateral to the preserved half field. Recordings from a patient after occipital lobectomy confirm the authors' previous suggestion that although the major positive component is recorded from the ipsilateral scalp the typical asymmetric half-field response is generated in the contralateral hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Two {{people with}} homonymous right <b>hemianopias</b> were tested {{on a number}} of {{measures}} of non-conscious and conscious perception of shape in the blind field. Experiment 1 examined preparatory manual adjustments in grasping objects. Both subjects performed well above chance not only in three-dimensional location but also in preforming the hand to the shape, size and orientation of objects. In Experiment 2 single upper-case letters were briefly exposed in the blind field, and subjects made forced choices among 6 alternatives in the sighted field. Performance improved over blocks of trials and was above chance, but not dramatically. In Experiment 3 single upper-case words were briefly presented in the blind field, and subjects chose which of two words exposed after in the intact field was semantically closer. In Experiment 4 subjects had to give the meaning of single ambiguous words (e. g. BANK) presented both visually in the intact field and auditorily. Each ambiguous word was preceded by a single upper-case word briefly presented in the blind field, biasing each meaning on different blocks of trials (e. g. MONEY and RIVER). In Experiment 3, although results were in the appropriate direction, they were not consistently well above chance. By contrast, i...|$|R

40|$|Looking {{forward to}} another {{exciting}} year of Clinical Ophthalmology Welcome {{to the first}} edition of Clinical Ophthalmology of 2008. This is our second year of publication after an extremely busy first year. We continue to get a huge number of submissions and this has accelerated now that the journal is almost completely open access. The reasons for this acceleration may be wider access of published articles from the journal or may simply be a result of the number of excellent articles that continue to be rejected by the more established journals. The latter often cite lack of print space as a reason for this rejection – something that we at Clinical Ophthalmology will never do. If our peer reviewers feel an article is good enough, then it will be published. As a testament to this excellence you can browse the current edition and, whatever your interests are, you will be sure to find at least one paper that catches your eye. For an up-to-date review of the role of ranibizumab in age-related macular degeneration treatment turn to the review by Spitzer and colleagues (2008).

50|$|Hemianopsia or <b>hemianopia</b> is {{a visual}} field loss {{on the left}} or right side of the {{vertical}} midline. It can affect one eye but usually affects both eyes. Homonymous hemianopsia, or homonymous <b>hemianopia,</b> is hemianopic visual field loss {{on the same side of}} both eyes. Homonymous hemianopsia occurs because the right half of the brain has visual pathways for the left hemifield of both eyes, and the left half of the brain has visual pathways for the right hemifield of both eyes. When one of these pathways is damaged, the corresponding visual field is lost.|$|E
50|$|Hemianopsia, or <b>hemianopia,</b> is a {{decreased}} {{vision or}} blindness (anopsia) {{in half the}} visual field, usually {{on one side of}} the vertical midline. The most common causes of this damage are stroke, brain tumor, and trauma.|$|E
