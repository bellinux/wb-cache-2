Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life <b>is</b> <b>precious,</b> but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
25|$|Guanajuato has {{the fourth}} lowest {{number of people}} who can speak an {{indigenous}} language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are Chichimeca Jonaz, Otomi and Nahuatl. The two most important indigenous groups are the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Otomi, both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall <b>is</b> <b>precious</b> and the diet includes foods such as pitayas, Myrtillocactus geometrizans (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and agave. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.|$|E

He also stated that the people they met in rural India were not previously familiar with Lohan.|$|E

2500|$|The {{whole idea}} of {{treating}} ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial. [...] A common objection is that life <b>is</b> <b>precious</b> or priceless, but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless under the assumptions of any branch of economics. [...] Reducing human bodies to financial values is {{a necessary part of}} every branch of economics and not always in the direct terms of insurance or wages. [...] Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services. [...] In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks. [...] Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.|$|E
2500|$|He {{returned}} to the Shire for Bilbo's [...] "eleventy-first" [...] (111th) birthday party in , bringing many fireworks for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, put on the Ring and disappeared, Gandalf strongly encouraged his old friend to leave the Ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo became hostile and accused Gandalf of trying to steal the Ring—which he called [...] "my precious", much as Gollum had done. (Isildur, who earlier possessed the ring and was destroyed by it, had written that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>precious</b> to me".) Alarmed, Gandalf impressed on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admitted that the Ring had been troubling him, and leaving it behind for Frodo, he departed for Rivendell. Though Bilbo would never be entirely free of the desire for the Ring, {{he was the first}} of its bearers to give it up willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{discussing}} the promotional trailers lauded the show's animation style and its musical soundtrack. The trailers prompted enthusiastic anticipation {{for the series}} premiere. When the first episode premiered at RTX, it was popular with attendees {{to the point that}} seating was full at all three screenings. Amanda Rush, writing for Crunchyroll, noted the anime and Western influences of the series, and praised it as [...] "quick-witted, exciting, lovely to look at" [...] saying fans of anime would enjoy it. The Yakima Herald-Republic called it [...] "thrilling" [...] and [...] "captivating" [...] and praised its [...] "beautiful" [...] 3D character animation. The Austin Chronicle described the premiere as making Oum the [...] "rock star" [...] of Rooster Teeth. The series has reportedly contributed to a 9% increase in views for Rooster Teeth's official YouTube channel. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis praised the series for its clever use of fairytale elements, fun and enjoyable dialogue, and the fighting choreography, but was critical about the short nature of the episodes, stating that, [...] "The biggest drawback in doing a micro-series... is that there <b>is</b> <b>precious</b> little time for good characterization". He was also critical of the technical issues of the animation, mentioning that the animation is good when the audience is unable to see the character's feet. He ends by saying that [...] "RWBY is a good first step into a world of possibilities." ...|$|E
