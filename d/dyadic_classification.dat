40|$|Classification {{trees are}} one of the most popular types of classifiers, with ease of {{implementation}} and interpretation being among their attractive features. Despite the widespread use of classification trees, theoretical analysis of their performance is scarce. In this paper, we show that a new family of classification trees, called <b>dyadic</b> <b>classification</b> trees (DCTs), are near optimal (in a minimax sense) for a very broad range of classification problems. This demonstrates that other schemes (e. g., neural networks, support vector machines) cannot perform significantly better than DCTs in many cases. We also show that this near optimal performance is attained with linear (in the number of training data) complexity growing and pruning algorithms. Moreover, the performance of DCTs on benchmark datasets compares favorably to that of standard CART, which is generally more computationally intensive and which does not possess similar near optimality properties. Our analysis stems from theoretica...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a family of {{computationally}} practical classifiers that converge to the Bayes error at near-minimax optimal rates {{for a variety of}} distributions. The classifiers are based on <b>dyadic</b> <b>classification</b> trees (DCTs), which involve adaptively pruned partitions of the feature space. A key aspect of DCTs is their spatial adaptivity, which enables local (rather than global) fitting of the decision boundary. Our risk analysis involves a spatial decomposition of the usual concentration inequalities, leading to a spatially adaptive, data-dependent pruning criterion. For any distribution on  ¢¡¤£¦¥¨ § whose Bayes decision boundary behaves locally like a Lipschitz smooth function, we show that the DCT error converges to the Bayes error at a rate within a logarithmic factor of the minimax optimal rate. We also study DCTs equipped with polynomial classification rules at each leaf, and show that as the smoothness of the boundary increases their errors converge to the Bayes error at a rate approaching ©����¦�� �, the parametric rate. We are not aware of any other practical classifiers that provide similar rate of convergence guarantees. Fast algorithms for tree pruning and adaptation are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} multi-scale tree-based {{approaches to}} image segmentation, using Rissanen's coding theoretic minimum description length (MDL) principle to penalize overly complex segmentations. Images are modelled as Gaussian random fields of independent pixels, with piecewise constant mean and variance. This model captures variations in both intensity (mean value) and texture (variance). Segmentation thus amounts to detecting {{changes in the}} mean and/or variance. One algorithm {{is based on an}} adaptive (greedy) rectangular recursive partitioning scheme. The second algorithm is an optimally-pruned "wedgelet" decorated dyadic partitioning. We compare the two schemes with an alternative constant variance <b>dyadic</b> CART (<b>classification</b> and regression tree) scheme which accounts only for variations in mean, and demonstrate their performance on SAR images. 1...|$|R
40|$|Conference paperIn this paper, using a coding theoretic approach, we {{implement}} Rissanen's {{concept of}} minimum description length (MDL) for segmenting an image into piecewise homogeneous regions. Our image {{model is a}} Gaussian random field whose mean and variance functions are piecewise constant across the image. The image pixels are (conditionally) independent and Gaussian, given the mean and variance functions. The model is intended to capture variations in both intensity (mean value) and texture (variance). We adopt a multi-scale tree based approach to develop two segmentation algorithms, using MDL to penalize overly complex segmentations.

40|$|Many complex multi-target {{prediction}} {{problems that}} concern large target spaces are characterised by {{a need for}} efficient prediction strategies that avoid the computation of predictions for all targets explicitly. Examples of such problems emerge in several subfields of machine learning, such as collaborative filtering, multi-label <b>classification,</b> <b>dyadic</b> prediction and biological network inference. In this article we analyse efficient and exact algorithms for computing the top-$K$ predictions in the above problem settings, using a general class of models that we refer to as separable linear relational models. We show how to use those inference algorithms, which are modifications of well-known information retrieval methods, {{in a variety of}} machine learning settings. Furthermore, we study the possibility of scoring items incompletely, while still retaining an exact top-K retrieval. Experimental results in several application domains reveal that the so-called threshold algorithm is very scalable, performing often many orders of magnitude more efficiently than the naive approach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} new feature extraction algorithms on the T-ray response of normal human bone cells and human osteosarcoma cells. One {{of the most}} promising feature extraction methods is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). However, the classification accuracy is dependant on the specific wavelet base chosen. Adaptive wavelets circumvent this problem by gradually adapting to the signal to retain optimum discriminatory information, while removing redundant information. Using adaptive wavelets, classification accuracy, using a quadratic Bayesian classifier, of 96. 88 % is obtained based on 25 features. In addition, the potential of using rational wavelets rather than the standard <b>dyadic</b> wavelets in <b>classification</b> is explored. The advantage it has over dyadic wavelets is that it allows a better adaptation of the scale factor according to the signal. An accuracy of 91. 15 % is obtained through rational wavelets with 12 coefficients using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier. These results highlight adaptive and rational wavelets as an efficient feature extraction method and the enormous potential of T-rays in cancer detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the class {{construction}} of the most non-linear Boolean bent-functions of any length  N  = 2 k  (k  = 2, 4, 6 …), {{on the basis of their}} spectral representation – Agievich bent squares. These perfect algebraic constructions are used as a basis to build many new cryptographic primitives, such as generators of pseudo-random key sequences, crypto graphic  S -boxes, etc. Bent-functions also find their application in the construction of  C -codes in the systems with code division multiple access (CDMA) to provide the lowest possible value of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)   k  = 1, as well as for the construction of error-correcting codes and systems of orthogonal biphasic signals. All the numerous applications of bent-functions relate to the theory of their synthesis. However, regular methods for complete class synthesis of bent-functions of any length   N   = 2 k   are currently unknown. The paper proposes a regular synthesis method for the basic Agievich bent squares of any order   n, based on a regular operator of <b>dyadic</b> shift. <b>Classification</b> for a complete set of spectral vectors of lengths (l   = 8, 16, …) based on a criterion of the maximum absolute value and set of absolute values of spectral components has been carried out in the paper. It has been shown that any spectral vector can be a basis for building bent squares. Results of the synthesis for the Agievich bent squares of order   n   = 8 have been generalized and it has been revealed that there are only 3 basic bent squares for this order, while the other 5 can be obtained with help the operation of step-cyclic shift. All the basic bent squares of order   n   = 16 have been synthesized that allows to construct the bent-functions of length   N   = 256. The obtained basic bent squares can be used either for direct synthesis of bent-functions and their practical application or for further research in order to synthesize new structures of bent squares of orders   n   = 16, 32, 64, … </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study {{of some of}} the {{principal}} social categories of the Rotinese, a population of approximately 100, 000 living in the Timor area of Eastern Indonesia. Roti, the home land of the Rotinese where over 70, 000 Rotinese still live, is a small island with a relatively high populatian density. Unlike other islands in Indonesia, Roti, the southernmost island of the archipelago is a dry land with few natural springs and subject to an irregular and inadequate monsoon rain. Because of this lack of water, the Rotinese are tappers of the lontar or palmyra palm (Borassus flabellifer L.). Yet they also cultivate rice, which is for them a prestige food, in both wet and dry rice fields, as well as a variety of mixed crops, including millet, sorghum and maize in well-fenced fields and gardens and they keep herds of water buffalo, sheep, goats, and horses which roam freely on unfenced land. Traditionally, the island of Roti is divided into eighteen self-ruling domains. From the early records of the Dutch East India Company, it is evident that most of these domains have existed as independent states for well over 250 years. In modern Indonesia, these same domains remain the administrative units of the island. Each domain is governed by its own Lord, who together with the lords of the various clans that make up the domain, presides at a flourishing court and makes decisions based upon the customary usage of that domain. Discourse and dispute are the first loves of the Rotinese. Rotinese society is hierarchical, with fixed classes of nobles and commoners. Nobles are ranked in status and belong to one of two clans, the clan of the Male-Lord and the clan of the Female or Sister-Lord. The Male-Lord who presides at court is the highest noble of the domain and is its political head, but he shares his temporal power with a Female-Lord or Lord-fetor. A dignitary, the Head of the Earth, of a commoner clan, traditionally regarded as the oldest clan of the domain, is the Male-Lord's ritual superior and, at court, is the traditional authority on customary usage. Each named clan recognized at court is distinguished by its separate traditions, rights, and privileges. Clans are compared to trees and like trees are of different size. Noble clans with their named lineages (or 'branches') are far more differentiated than are commoner clans. Some clans are highly exogamous for reasons of status or size; some are preferably exogamous; while other clans, not larger than small lineages, are strictly exogamous. A child's membership within his lineage is established by his father's payment of his mother's bridewealth. A woman, for whom bridewealth is not paid, contributes children to her brother's lineage. Marriage on Roti is not prescriptive, but the Rotinese do have alliances (described as the 'tying' of various kinds of bonds) and they do have preferred forms of cross-cousin marriage. The clans of the Male and Female Lords should, it is felt, be joined in alliance but each domain has its own special alliances between particular groups. Women, ranked according to the status of their lineage and their clan, are accorded different levels of bridewealth and are exchanged among descent groups to the formation of alliances. Alliances, once established, endure for three generations and the former wife-givers, a person's matrilateral affines, are his obligationary ritual protectors throughout his life. A person's a matrilateral affines are spoken of as the 'roots' by which a person grows and prospers; these all important relations are described by a variety of metaphors involving the imagery of planting and growing. The prefatory remarks outline some of the problems considered in the thesis: the concern with the control of water and women; the equation frequently drawn between women, water, and the moon; the distinction between marriageable and unmarriageable women; the categories of male and female as used to order society; the problem of <b>dyadic</b> and triadic <b>classification</b> and the pervasive metaphor of plant and tree. Chapter I is a general introduction, describing the island of Roti and ita political divisions, the distribution of the population and the linguistic position of Rotinese with its many dialects. The Botinese, in fact, possess two languages: an ordinary language and a ritual or poetic language. The ritual language, used on formal occasions, is based on an ordered pairing of all words and expressions. This language of dualism with its established corpus of chants and sayings is a collective expression of Rotinose wisdom. On the basis of statements in both ordinary and ritual language, Chapter I offers an analysis of the primary co-ordinates of the symbolic order and of the Rotinese concepts of order and perfection. Chapter II is a study of Rotinese modes of livelihood: the classification of the 'nine seeds' or crops of the Botinese, the male and female lontar palm, the various sacrificial corporations that organise work in the fields and the annual agricultural cycle. The lontar palm is given special attention because of its crucial importance to subsistence and also because of the symbolism it provides. Chapter II includes a discussion of the use of fencing in the establishment of land ownership or membership in a field corporation. The structure of the sacrificial corporations that control water is shown to be analogous to the structure of power and authority in the domain. The first half of Chapter III provides an examination of Rotinese ideas about the structure of the domain: the nature of social classes, the place of ritual authority, the division of temporal power, the structure of the court and the quality of 'maleness' which hierarchically orders the society. The second half of this chapter considers in detail the organization of a single domain, that of Termanu. A summarry is made of the principal legends of each clan and the rights and privileges these legends are said to validate. The ideal structure of the domain is compared with the actual existing organisation. The first half of Chapterr IV offers an analysis of the subdivisions of the clan: the lineages that regulate marriage and the individual property holding houses found scattered wherever there is sufficient water to maintain a household. The role of women and the incorporation of clients is also discussed. The second half of this chapter again deals with the domain of Termanu: the subdivisions of its clans and lineages. Detailed data are provided on the incorporation of a single client line and on a village area of the domain. Chapter V is an examination of marriage and alliance among the Rotinese. Agnatic relations are distinguished from affinal relations, particularly the matrilateral relations of the former wife-givers. Rotineae ideas on marriage are discussed as is the all important ritual role of the mother's brother. Finally the Rotinese relatioship terminology is considered as a system of reference, address and sentiment. Onoe appendix gives the ritual names of the island of Roti and its domains, while another appendixc gives two variant legends which argue the ritual ownership of a source of water in Baä, a small domain of central Roti. The thesis includes a comprehensive bibliography of Roti and a brief additional bibliography of other works used in the preparation of the thesis. </p...|$|R
