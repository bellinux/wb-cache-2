An important question therefore is how the law {{can deal with the}} regulation of new health risks in the future and thus, how an adequate balance between the precedence of economic interests and the precedence of social health and safety can be determined ex ante, in order to prevent new social health problems, and a new booming of tort law, from arising. In this respect it is important to stress that he causation of damage, even of <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damage,</b> as such is not wrongful. The causation of <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damage</b> only becomes wrongful, if insufficient precautions were taken. The question then is: how much precaution is required and, more specifically, what is the criterion to determine how much precaution is required in a concrete case? In my view, an answer to this question must predominantly consist of the separation of the regulation issue (including the enforcement of regulatory measures) and the compensation issue, so that both questions are no longer interlinked. The asbestos jurisprudence has shown that tort law apparently is flexible enough, given new or changing external developments or bottlenecks, to generate new solutions for damage problems that would be out of its reach when applying regular tort law, but also that the degree to which tort law is allowed room to develop such solutions and thus move outside its own parameters, strongly depends on the presence and of scope of other compensation mechanisms (e. g. social security). The existence of social security can temper the development of a social compensation issue. In order to retain the rationality and realism of tort law and social security law, regulators should therefore be prepared to formulate new answers {{in order to deal with}} new social risks (viz. the answer of the industrial accident and occupational disease insurance at the beginning of the last century in order to deal with the old social risks), with an eye to exercising a tempering influence on the use of tort la...|$|E
40|$|The greater Paris region faces a {{significant}} {{risk of flooding}} due to potential spill-over from the Seine and the Marne. Because the last major flood occurred in 1910, the event has faded in the collective memory. Consequently, the population and the public authorities have difficulty imagining that such a catastrophe might repeat itself. In parallel, widespread urban expansion into flood zones has considerably aggravated the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damage</b> if an event of a comparable intensity were to hit the region. In response to this situation, the EPTB Seine Grands Lacs – a public territorial basin establishment– decided {{to take action to}} reduce this risk. It began by commissioning a study from the OECD on flood risk prevention in the Seine Basin. This study was presented in January 2014 and highlighted the considerable risk of flooding in or near Paris, which could, affect a total of nearly 5 million people, cause up to € 30 billion in direct damage and affect up to 400. 000 jobs. It also put forward 14 recommendations that are being implemented by the public authorities, at either the national, basin or local level. The EPTB launched in partnership with the government a second initiative for which it steers and coordinates a coherent, balanced, relevant and gradual programme of 78 flood prevention actions. As a new post- 2015 framework for disaster risk reduction was adopted in Sendai in March 2015 taking in account lessons learned during the 2005 - 2015 period, gaps identified and future challenges, this paper addresses the question of the impact of this new international framework on the implementation of the flood prevention of Paris region. One of the main points developed is the necessity to increase public awareness, to enhance disaster preparedness for effective response and to “build back better” in recovery rehabilitation and reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY. Oil and gas {{exploitation}} and production in Nigeria, {{particularly in the}} Niger Delta region, is awash with pollution incidents with its attendant impact {{on the health of}} locals as well as <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damage</b> on the biodiversity of the region. Owing to this development, victims of environmental pollution have repeatedly instituted legal actions against transnational corporations (TNCs) and the Federal Government with a view to recovering damages and enforcing rights via statutory claims (which basically reflects traditional English common law rules on liability). Notwithstanding, it is observed that such claims have not availed victims of pollution with the basic reliefs sought, and this is seemingly traceable to the ‘economic interest’ which government retains in oil and gas activities, the technicalities in proving negligence on the part of TNCs; as a vast majority of oil pollution incidents are caused by ‘acts of third parties’, and under such scenarios, TNCs will only be liable where they neglect to protect oil facilities, and the lack of direct legal provisions to provide for fundamental rights to a clean environment, although even before Nigeria attained her independence in 1960 the Oil Pipelines Act of 1955 addressed some oil-related environmental problems. These challenges, amongst others have prompted victims of environmental pollution in Nigeria, in recent years, to seek for legal redress in foreign jurisdictions. The current research opted for turnaround in the environmental justice system by considering whether there is any legal nexus between environmental pollution and breach of fundamental rights (‘rights to a healthy environment’) of the people, and whether such right will generate an absolute liability against TNCs? It is recognised that ‘fundamental rights’ which are found in the Nigerian Constitution have higher status over other rights as contained in statutes, and where these rights are violated, liability will be either strict or absolute as the case may be; this is pursuant to findings in the current research that the defence of ‘act of third parties’ and others may not be sustained in fundamental rights enforcement proceedings, and owing to this, victims of environmental pollution incidents in Nigeria {{will be able to get}} adequate redress and secure higher standards of environmental quality. This conclusion is reached through a close examination of legal instruments, case-law and opinions of experts in Nigeria and a limited number of other jurisdictions...|$|E
50|$|In modern tort law, {{application}} of economic analysis to assign liability for damages was popularized by Judge Learned Hand of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in his decision, United States v. Carroll Towing Co. 159 F.2d 169 (2d. Cir. 1947). Judge Hand's holding resolved simply that liability could {{be determined by}} applying the formula of B < PL, where B = the burden (economic or otherwise) of adequate protection against <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damages,</b> P = the probability of damage (or loss) occurring and L = {{the gravity of the}} resulting injury (loss). This decision flung open the doors of economic analysis in tort cases, thanks in no small part to Judge Hand's popularity among legal scholars.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this text}} is {{to prove that the}} {{licensing}} procedure is not framed within a real environmental protection. It stems in a procedure that prompts its managers to terminate it and to grant a permission lacking substantial content and a thorough evaluation of its consequenoces. Citizenship participation and previous consultation to indigenous people are barely obstacles which are perceived as opposition between “majorities” pursuing the country’s development, on one hand, the econeoliberal or eco-capitalist ideology whose purpose is to preserve the environment, {{and on the other hand}} those minorities who are against this. Generally speaking, the procedure does not follow the regulations of environmental law and is exempt of liability in the hypothesis of <b>foreseeable</b> <b>damages.</b> Somehow, it leads to an inconstitutional situatio...|$|R

40|$|Natural hazards, human-induced accidents, and {{malicious}} acts {{have caused}} great losses and disruptions to society. After September 11, 2001, critical infrastructure protection {{has become a}} national focus in the United States {{and is likely to}} remain one for the <b>foreseeable</b> future. <b>Damage</b> to our infrastructures and assets could be mitigated through pre-disaster planning and actions. We have developed a systematic methodology to assess and rank the risks from these multiple hazards in a community of 20, 000 people. It is an interdisciplinary study that includes probabilistic risk assessment, decision analysis, and expert judgment. Scenarios are constructed to show how the initiating events evolve into undesirable consequences. A value tree, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is used to capture the decision maker’s preferences about the impacts on the infrastructures and other assets. The risks from random failures are ranked according to their Expected Performance Index, which is the product of frequency, probability, and consequence of a scenario. Risks from malicious acts are ranked according to their Performance Index as the frequency of attack is not available. ...|$|R
