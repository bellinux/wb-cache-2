As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E

On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run homer {{in the bottom of}} the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} examine in vivo anticancer {{efficacy}} of scorpion venom, 80 female albino mice were inoculated with i.p. injection of 106 EAC cells in a volume of 0.2  ml. These mice were randomly divided into five groups (10 or 20 mice/group). After 48  h of tumor inoculation, mice were treated i.p. with A. amoreuxi venom or cisplatin <b>every</b> other <b>day</b> according to the following scheme: Group I: normal mice saline-control group (normal control): ten normal mice were injected i.p. with 0.2  ml physiological saline (0.9  g/dL) <b>every</b> other <b>day</b> <b>for</b> 13  days. Group II: EAC-bearing mice control group (EAC control): 20 EAC-bearing mice injected with 0.2  ml physiological saline <b>every</b> other <b>day</b> <b>for</b> 13  days. Group III: EAC-bearing mice venom-treated group: 20 EAC-bearing mice treated with A. amoreuxi venom (1 / 5 LD 50; 0.22  mg/kg) <b>every</b> other <b>day</b> <b>for</b> 13  days.

Group V: A. amoreuxi venom-treated group: ten normal mice treated with 1 / 5 LD 50 (0.22  mg/kg) of A. amoreuxi venom <b>every</b> other <b>day</b> <b>for</b> 13  days. The animals with ascitic tumor were weighed every 3  days. Total experimental period was 25  days and at 14 th day, 6 mice in each group were anesthetized and sacrificed to (1) evaluate anti-tumor activity of scorpion venom and (2) to conduct hematological, biochemical and histopathological assay. The remaining mice in Group II–Group IV (n =  14 mice/each group) were kept alive to estimate the mean survival time (MST) and percent increase in life span (% ILS).|$|R
