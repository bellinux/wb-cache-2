40|$|Examination of the <b>humpback</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus gibbus (Perciformes: Lutjanidae), from Lizard Island off the Great Barrier Reef and Rasdhoo Atoll, Maldives {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a new species of Lobosorchis (Digenea: Cryptogonimidae), L. polygongylus n. sp. Lobosorchis polygongylus n. sp. is distinguished from the type-and only other species, L. tibaldiae by the combination of body size, oral spine number (60 - 81 in L. polygongylus, 47 - 56 in L. tibaldiae) and number of testes (13 - 25 in L. polygongylus, 9 in L. tibaldiae). Bayesian inference analysis using data from the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS 1 and ITS 2), 5. 8 S and the large subunit (LSU) nuclear ribosomal DNA of L. polygongylus, L. tibaldiae and species of Beluesca, Caulanus, Chelediadema, Neometadena, Latuterus, Retrovarium and Siphoderina was performed to explore phylogenetic relationships of species of Lobosorchis with other cryptogonimid taxa. Despite the significant morphological differences between Lobosorchis polygongylus and L. tibaldiae, these two species differed consistently by only 5 base pairs (bp) over the entire ITS region (3 bp in ITS 1, 0 bp in 5. 8 S and 2 bp in ITS 2) and 1 bp in the LSU rDNA regions examined. The ITS 2 rDNA region was sequenced from metacercariae obtained from the fins, flesh or body cavities of a number of fishes belonging to the Blenniidae, Pomacentridae and Tetraodontidae and analysed using minimum evolution analysis with L. polygongylus and L. tibaldiae. This {{revealed the}} presence of two additional genotypes (putative Lobosorchis sp. A and B), which consistently differed from L. polygongylus by 1 and 4 bp, L. tibaldiae by 1 and 4 bp and from each other by 3 bp over the ITS 2 dataset. Although these genetic differences are relatively small, when evaluated in light of the differences observed between L. polygongylus and L. tibaldiae (which are morphologically quite distinct) and differences seen in other congeneric cryptogonimid taxa, the ITS 2 rDNA data alone suggest that at least two more species of Lobosorchis are present at Lizard Island. These data also suggest that the ITS 2 rDNA region alone is suitable for resolving operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the species level within the Cryptogonimidae based on what was observed in this and other cryptogonimid systems. A morphological description of metacercariae of L. tibaldiae obtained from two species of Pomacentridae at Heron Island, off the Great Barrier Reef is also provided...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} study, {{it still}} {{is not clear whether}} artificial reefs produce new fish biomass or whether they only attract various species and make them more vulnerable to fishing mortality. To further evaluate this question, the size and age of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) were sampled from April to November 2010 at artificial reefs south of Mobile Bay off the coast of Alabama and compared with the age of the artificial reef at the site of capture.

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} nature of direct and {{indirect}} species interactions is a critical pre-cursor to successful resource management. In the northern Gulf of Mexico fisheries ecosys-tem, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus campechanus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are two commercially harvested species within a larger reef fish complex. These two species share similar habitats and diets; however, {{little is known about}} how these species partition habitat and dietary resources.

Field data from multiple gear types demonstrates that <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> and vermilion snapper frequently cohabited reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and Pianka’s niche overlap indices suggest significantly overlapping diets.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{evaluated}} mercury (Hg) {{contamination in}} juvenile <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus campechanus (, 250 mm total length) {{as an indicator}} of Hg pollution on the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) continental shelf. Specifically, we examined the effects of fish size, commercial shrimp trawling, and habitat type on total Hg concentrations and stable nitrogen isotope ratios (d 15 N; a proxy for trophic position) in <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Red snapper Hg concentrations and d 15 N values were positively and significantly correlated with fish size. In addition, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected over trawled habitats had significantly higher Hg concentrations and d 15 N values than did <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected from similar, nontrawled habitats. Red snapper also exhibited habitat-specific differences in Hg concentrations and d 15 N values, but differences were size dependent and generally small. Our study suggests that the Hg concentrations of juvenile <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in the northern GOM are elevated in areas where commercial shrimp trawling occurs, possibly due to increases in both <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> trophic position and bioavailable Hg in trawled areas. Additional studies are needed to determine whether Hg concentrations are elevated in fish from trawled areas in other marine ecosystems.

40|$|I am steadfast {{against any}} change {{at this time}} for {{recreational}} fisherman. First and foremost {{we need to know}} how many anglers targeting <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> there really are. In my opinion there is dire need for a <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> tag or stamp to be issued with a state fishing license or available at sporting goods, bait camps, marinas, or some readily available source and most anglers {{would be willing to pay}} a reasonable fee for it. Then and only then can we get a real number of anglers targeting <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> With that you would have the information to gather your catch information as you could get addresses, phone numbers, email or other contact for the real snapper anglers. From this you could do creel surveys at the marinas, bait camps, boat ramps, or do phone email surveys.

40|$|As {{a highly}} {{targeted}} species, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> have been overfished since the 1970 ?s. Inadequate {{monitoring and reporting}} of discard rates impedes regulatory measures which are in place to allow <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> populations to reach a healthy, sustainable level. This study documented the relationship between morphometric measurements and otolith analysis of <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught from a recreational headboat fishing exclusively in the GOM?s EEZ of the upper Texas coast. The collected data of this research show that of the 594 <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught within the sample group, 76 % of the fish were discarded; analysis of the lengths of these discarded fish show that 15. 5 % were of regulation size (16 inches) or larger, clear evidence that high-grading is occurring. The effort for {{the total amount of}} <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> caught by each individual angler within the sample group was measured to determine on average, approximately two <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> were caught per person, per hour. The size distribution ranged from 16 to 32 inches with a mean total length of 21. 32 inches for retained fish while discarded fish ranged from 5. 5 to 22. 5 inches with a mean of 14. 23. Weight distribution ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 5 pounds with a mean of 5. 81 pounds for retained fish and 0. 20 to 6 pounds with a mean of 1. 57 pounds for discarded fish. Age distribution ranged from 3 to 14 years of age; <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> can live over 50 years, however relatively none (2. 42 %) older than 10 years were present in the sample, demonstrating a highly truncated population. Because fecundancy increases with age in females, longevity extends reproduction potential for <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Management of reef fishes, and <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in particular, are difficult due to variances in growth rates and habitat use, complex population structure, and increasing reproduction levels with maturity. Recommendations for management include implementing an educational outreach program, reducing effort and discard rates, lowing rates of exploitation, and creating a marine reserve. Future research should address the entire Texas coast population of for-hire vessels (charter and headboats) to obtain data on discard rates and age distribution of <b>red</b> <b>snapper...</b>|$|R
