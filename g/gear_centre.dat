Currently rigid Landing Gear models are used to simulate dynamic ground manoeuvres using the software MSC ADAMS/View. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how flexibility in Landing Gear can affect aircraft performances on ground operations. Two different ways of representing flexibility have been considered during this work: Beam model and mnf model. The comparison against the beam model has been done on the A 350 XWB. The comparison against the mnf model has been done on A 320. This is due to model availability within Airbus. Simulations show little differences in terms of turning performances.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} in non-circular gears design, based on the mathematical description of the meshing progress. The teeth profiles are generated by numerical integration of a differential equation, which describes the contact point displacement, {{along the line of}} action, {{as a function of the}} pitch lines shape and of the pressure angle. In the typical arrangement, a pair of non-circular gears is used to drive a slider-crank mechanism, whose cursor follows a prescribed law of motion, thus working as a function generator. A procedure of inverse kinematics is illustrated, to determine the variable transmission ratio and then the pitch curves, once given the geometry of the slider-crank mechanism and the distance between the <b>gears</b> <b>centres</b> of rotation. An application of the method is described, where the ram of a mechanical press is driven according to a cinematically optimized law of motion. First step is the pitch lines synthesis, starting from the prescribed output curve. The teeth profiles are then generated on the primitives previously determined. A virtual analysis is performed to validate the method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of linear and angular {{misalignments}} on static contact parameters in a gear pair, taken at various points during the gear meshing cycle. The parameters of interest include {{the degree to which}} the load is shared among the teeth in contact (load sharing ratio (LSR)), the reaction forces at the <b>gear</b> <b>centres</b> and the static transmission error (STE), which can be thought of as the energy stored in the system. The LSR and STE are frequently used in vibratory models of gearboxes to model the coupling between gears and have considerable effects on the system response. In the current work, these parameters are calculated through the analysis of a 3 D spur gear model in the finite element package ABAQUS (TM), where a gear pair is subjected to a known torque at various rotational positions to include regions of single and double tooth contact. It is shown that the introduction of misalignment usually has an effect on the system; however, substantial axial and yaw misalignment are required before non-negligible forces develop. It is also shown that pitch misalignment is the most influential with regard to the reaction moments and transmission error, whereas radial misalignment is more influential in the decomposition of the normal contact force into vertical and horizontal forces...|$|R
25|$|The {{inferior}} planet mechanism {{includes the}} sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For {{each of the}} three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the <b>gear's</b> <b>centre</b> and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, {{out in front of the}} front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.|$|R

40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. nominal transmitted torque under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous centre distance between the <b>gears.</b> <b>Centre</b> distance variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the active tooth height. Furthermore after a change in centre distance, the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of centre distance variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in centre distance (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} centre distance. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} years a great range of {{computer}} aided tools has been generated to support the development process of various products. The goal of a continuous data flow, needed for high efficiency, requires powerful standards for the data exchange. At the FZG (<b>Gear</b> Research <b>Centre)</b> of the Technical University of Munich {{there was a need}} for a common gear data format for data exchange between gear calculation programs. The STEP standard ISO 10303 was developed for this type of purpose, but a suitable definition of gear data was still missing, even in the Application Protocol AP 214, developed for the design process in the automotive industry. The creation of a new STEP Application Protocol or the extension of existing protocol would be a very time consumpting normative process. So a new method was introduced by FZG. Some very general definitions of an Application Protocol (here AP 214) were used to determine rules for an exact specification of the required kind of data. In this case a product model for gear units was defined based on elements of the AP 214. Therefore no change of the Application Protocol is necessary. Meanwhile the product model for gear units has been published as a VDMA paper and successfully introduced for data exchange within the German gear industry associated with FVA (German Research Organisation for Gears and Transmissions). This method can also be adopted for other applications not yet sufficiently defined by STEP. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{experimental data}} {{have demonstrated the}} severity of idling gear rattle depends {{not only on the}} amplitude, but also the phase of an external sinusoidal forcing. One possible explanation for this is in small tooth profile errors. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis, by deriving an equation of motion incorporating an error function and losses at the mesh interface, values of which are obtained from experimental data. By solving the equations of motion, theoretical gear rattle trajectories are obtained. Theoretical and experimental trajectories are then compared, by way of time domain plots as well as via contour plots linking the amplitude of backlash oscillation to the amplitude and phase of input forcing. For most profile error functions, good agreement is achieved between the model and experimental data. In the case where the profile errors are dominated by misalignment between the <b>gear</b> and shaft <b>centres</b> agreement is less good and suggestions of areas of further study required for model refinement are proposed. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At the FZG (<b>Gear</b> Research <b>Centre,</b> Munich, Germany) a {{research}} project was carried out to analyze {{the influence of the}} hypoid offset on the load capacity of bevel gears by systematic theoretical and experimental investigations. For the experimental investigations two types of bevel gears were designed, one for the pitting tests and one for the tooth root tests. The results of the tooth root tests showed as expected an increasing load capacity with higher offsets. In contrast the pitting tests showed an increasing, but after reaching a maximum, a decreasing load capacity with higher offsets. Regarding the test results a new calculation method was developed that is based on a loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA). The method is able to consider the local stresses on the flank and in the tooth root. The local strength values are derived out of the standard ISO 6336 for the calculation of helical gears. For bending the local geometry of the tooth root is considered to adopt the strength values of helical gears to bevel and hypoid gears. As a result the local safety factors might be calculated along the face width of pinion and wheel. For pitting the local sliding conditions are taken into account in order to appraise the local lubrication conditions as well as the risk of crack initiations due to shear stresses and higher contact temperatures. The recalculation of the test showed for both types of failure a good correlation between the test results and the calculated values...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a material-physically based model for calculating the load capacity of gears {{taking into account}} the different stress conditions in the tooth root and on the tooth flank and considering decisive material properties due to different heat treatment processes. The basis of the model is a local comparison of the occurring stresses and the available strength values in the gear volume. The complex stress condition on the tooth flank is illustrated. On the flank occurs a three dimensional stress condition with a rotating principal stress system. Furthermore the influences of residual stresses and from the contact of technical rough surfaces on this stress condition are discussed. Especially the described complex stress condition on the tooth flank requires the definition of an adequate criterion of failure. For this purpose a variant of the Schubspannungsintensitätshypothese (SIH) is proposed. The applicability of the proposed model is verified with numerous results of experimental investigations. Some of the calculations are presented here. Altogether there is a good agreement between the test results and the calculated results especially for the amount of the fatigue limit, the kind of damage (e. g. tooth root breakage, pitting and tooth breakage in the region of the flank) and the position of the beginning of the damage in the material at and below the surface. The calculation model is successfully used at the <b>Gear</b> Research <b>Centre</b> (FZG, TU Munich) in several research projects and currently will be refined more in detail for the damage type of tooth breakage in the region of the gear flank...|$|R

50|$|Where the RC30 {{had used}} roller {{bearings}} on the camshafts, the RC45 used more conventional plain bearings. The RC30 {{had used a}} piston with one compression ring and oil control ring to reduce friction. This was very effective for racing but resulted in increased oil consumption in the road-going bikes. The RC45 changed to the more conventional two compression ring system, also with an oil control ring.

One huge change in engine architecture was the change from <b>centre</b> <b>gear</b> drive mechanism to crank/camshaft drive, which was located {{on the end of}} the crankshaft (another NR750 follow on). This reduced the number of engine crankshaft bearings by one and camshaft bearings by four with an associated reduction in friction.

Rolls-Royce also developed the flame traps for the inlet manifold, used to prevent a backfire causing an explosion in the highly compressed fuel/air mixture in the manifold. The flame trap was a feature not previously used on car engines, due to the relatively low amounts of supercharging then in use, but it was by then a necessity on high-powered piston aero engines such as the Merlin and Griffon.

The two <b>gears</b> have different <b>centres</b> of rotation, so the pin must {{move back and forth}} in the slot.

The rapidly expanding Educare preschool project in the rural area ot Keiskammahoek in Ciskei was investigated as an example ot community-based low-cost preschool education. A final sample of 41 children who had attended Educare Centres were matched to a control group on age, sex, primary school (where possible), and breadwinner's occupation. The Abbreviated Aptitude Test for School Beginners (standardised on Xhosa-speaking school beginners) {{was used to test}} tor {{significant differences between the two}} groups six to seven weeks atter school entry.

On a subjective rating scale for general-linguistic development and socio-emotional adjustment, no significant difference between means of the experimental and control groups was found. The experimental group's tailure to perform better than the control group, could be ascribed to various reasons, amongst others, the possible shortcoming that the pairs were not matched on intelligence, severe lack ot equipment in Educare Centres, large numbers of children in the majority of groups, uniform programmes for a wide age range, irregular attendance ot children, the low level of training of supervisors and poor home conditions. Scholastic abilities of school beginners in the Keiskammahoek District, as tested, were poor. Results deviated grossly from standardised norms.
