2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2011, Tyler worked with {{the other members of}} Aerosmith on the band's next studio album, {{scheduled}} for release in the spring of 2012. In September 2011, he starred as the inspiration for Andy Hilfiger's fashion line, [...] "Andrew Charles". [...] Tyler developed a signature scarf collection called [...] "Rock Scarf" [...] for Andrew Charles. On October 22, 2011, Tyler set off for an 18-date Aerosmith tour across Latin America and Japan. On October 25, it was reported by TMZ that Tyler slipped in his hotel shower in Paraguay and injured his face, including losing several teeth. Tyler was rushed to the hospital, and the scheduled show was postponed for the following night. When he did finally perform after the opening song, he proudly displayed his broken tooth which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> string around his neck. He then removed his sunglasses to reveal a nasty black eye. The tour wrapped up on December 10 in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> long fur-lined coat, and {{he carried}} a fifty-dollar suit case that he put down on the seat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word,--not {{even that}} he was coming. But I saw him {{as he left the}} chambers, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bright hat and a new coat." ...|$|E
25|$|Later, Al-Maqrizi tells a {{story in}} which Muqawqis, ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to {{describe}} Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{episode of}} Date My Playlist on MTV.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{large number}} of {{advisory}} boards in India since 2006: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{class to}} the Rovers, and no mistake!" [...] was Spouter's comment. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair of long whiskers, a linen duster, farm boots, {{and a big}} straw hat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so. Of course <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slouch hat, drawn {{down over}} his eyes, and an unusual suit of clothing, but I am pretty certain it was Merwell." ...|$|E
60|$|Hearing voices {{coming from}} the sitting-room, Halliday talking to Libidnikov, {{he went to the}} door and glanced in. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> silk wrap of a {{beautiful}} bluish colour, with an amethyst hem.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> {{recorded}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} labels, including RCA, Vox, Fidelio, Arabesque, Vanguard and Biddulph.|$|R
50|$|He {{is married}} to Theresa Moritz, with whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> collaborated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of books.|$|R
50|$|In 1814, Holm {{established}} a shipyard at Wilders Plads which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> obtained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lease.|$|R
60|$|But it so {{happened}} that {{about three weeks}} later Blinks came home to his residence in an obvious state of excitement. His face was flushed and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> silly little round cap with a glazed peak.|$|E
60|$|At {{a quarter}} past seven {{on the next}} morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> suit of the villainously fitting, {{ready-made}} clothes {{and a pair of}} the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{once more}} remembered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair of burst canvas shoes, {{as well as}} old duck {{trousers}} cobbled with sail twine, and a man-o'-war cap that had grown shapeless with the rain. He also realized that his companion was quite aware of it too.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> collaborated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{articles}} on plural descriptions with Alex Oliver.|$|R
50|$|Sejal Shah is an Indian cinematographer. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} Bollywood films and adverts.|$|R
50|$|There were {{allegations}} in 2004 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> carried <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{affair with a}} female prison warder.|$|R
60|$|Fred's rod bent like a willow wand. His {{eyes seemed}} to flash, and his lips were tightly pressed together, for he felt that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> very large fish. Suddenly it darted up stream, and did what the large fish seldom do--leaped quite out of the water.|$|E
60|$|He {{came into}} my room in that modest, Prussian way that he has, {{clicking}} his heels together, his head very erect, his neck tightly gripped in his forty-two centimeter collar. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Pickelhaube, or Prussian helmet, which he removed with a sweeping gesture and laid on the sofa.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Nicholson, father. At least, I am {{almost certain}} that it was him. It was {{too dark to see}} his face. I could see the outline of his head against the window, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cap with a cock's feather which I had noticed the man wore." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cappella musical theatre {{projects}} including [...] "Street" [...] and [...] "Our World".|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> been <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{advisory}} {{member for}} present Project (CABE and A&B) and the Scottish Arts Council.|$|R
50|$|Jonibek Murodov gave concerts {{all around}} the world and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> world tour since 2007.|$|R
6000|$|VOLTAIRE'S DRESS. [...] "On the {{two days}} I saw him, he wore white cloth shoes, white woollen stockings, red breeches, with a nightgown and {{waistcoat}} of blue linen, flowered, and lined with yellow. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> grizzle wig with three ties, and over it a silk nightcap embroidered with gold and silver." ...|$|E
60|$|Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> broad-brimmed, conical hat, {{beneath the}} shadow of which a wild visage was indistinctly seen, {{floating}} away, as it were, into a dusky wilderness of mustache and beard. His eyes winked, and turned uneasily from the torches, like a creature to whom midnight would be more congenial than noonday.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> long {{frock coat}} that reached nearly to his knees. He was leading a little {{procession}} of very heavy men in morning coats, upstairs towards the private luncheon rooms. They moved like a funeral, puffing as they went. I had seen company directors before and I {{knew what they}} were at sight.|$|E
50|$|During {{this time}} {{his passion for}} the local {{experience}} did not restrict itself to music. Not only did he often spend the little money that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> extensive collection of first editions by local authors, he rarely missed the opening night of any locally penned play. It was perhaps this uniquely SA philosophy that allows many important actors, writers and musicians to quote him as an influence.|$|R
50|$|Of {{somewhat}} similar standing is the Diocesan Administrator (formerly called a Vicar Capitular) elected to govern a diocese during a vacancy. Apart from certain limitations {{of nature and}} law, <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a diocesan bishop. Occasionally an Apostolic Administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} select committees, {{and has been}} a member of the Treasury Select Committee since 2001.|$|R
60|$|It was not, indeed, {{until three}} o'clock {{that he saw}} Nicholson coming along. He was more gaily dressed {{than he had been}} on the {{previous}} day. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> green cloth coat with gold braid round the cuffs, an embroidered waistcoat, yellow breeches, top boots, and three-cornered hat. He was riding at foot pace.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So it is,' said Martin. 'Very true. There was {{a fellow}} only {{a week or so}} ago--a Mr Tigg--who {{borrowed}} all the money <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> promise to repay it in a few days. It was but half a sovereign, to be sure; but it's well it was no more, for he'll never see it again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, I {{goes to a}} livery {{stable and}} hires a buggy on my looks. I drove out to the Plunkett farm and hitched. There was a man {{sitting on the front}} steps of the house. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> white flannel suit, a diamond ring, golf cap and a pink ascot tie. 'Summer boarder,' says I to myself.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> taken <b>on</b> <b>a</b> role as {{co-host of}} a monthly live soccer/football talk show called Diski Nites in Cape Town.|$|R
50|$|Since then <b>he</b> <b>has</b> worked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{wide range}} of titles from 2000 AD to Warrior and various Marvel UK titles.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of a Hopi Indian boy from a wealthy family, ca. 1900. From the abdomen up. He is wearing rich wampum necklaces (Navajo jewelry) and a warrior's headdress (a cloth wrapped around his head). <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dark shirt. A twisted cloth band is tied across his forehead. His dark hair is shorn at shoulder length. His left hand is <b>on</b> his hip. <b>A</b> cracked adobe wall is visible behind him...|$|R
