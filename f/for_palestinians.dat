25|$|Almost a {{year after}} the Gaza War a group of Neturei Karta members crossed into Gaza as part of the Gaza Freedom March to {{celebrate}} Jewish Shabbos to show support <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in the Hamas ruled enclave.|$|E
25|$|The BBC also faced {{criticism}} for not airing a Disasters Emergency Committee aid appeal <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> who suffered in Gaza during 22-day war there in late 2008/early 2009. Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal, but rival Sky News did not.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the {{proposals}} argue that making unilateral demands on Israel will not promote negotiation and a just peace. Furthermore, disinvestment, it is claimed, would hurt Palestinians more than any other, as all of the Israeli factories located beyond the Green Line employ Palestinian workers, providing 70,000 jobs <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians.</b>|$|E

25|$|Then on 9 April 1948, about 120 Lehi and Irgun fighters, {{acting in}} {{cooperation}} with the Haganah, attacked and captured Deir Yassin. The attack was at night, the fighting was confused, and many civilian inhabitants of the village were killed. This action had great consequences for the war, and remains a cause celebre <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> ever since.|$|E
25|$|Nazareth {{was in the}} {{territory}} allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In {{the months leading up}} to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the town became a refuge <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> fleeing the urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa and Baysan before and during the Haganah's capture of those cities on 18 April, 22 April and 12 May 1948, respectively.|$|E
25|$|From the {{perspective}} of the PLO, Israel responded to the disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt for the lives and safety of Palestinians. <b>For</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.|$|E
40|$|The {{returns to}} {{schooling}} <b>for</b> <b>Palestinian</b> {{men in the}} West Bank and Gaza Strip declined sharply from 1981 to 1987 but recovered slightly from 1987 to 1991. This article examines {{the degree to which}} these returns were associated with the demand <b>for</b> <b>Palestinian</b> labor. Contrary to previous research, the current study finds that labor demand and not just the increased schooling of Palestinians determined the returns to schooling. Specifically, increased demand <b>for</b> unskilled <b>Palestinian</b> labor in Israel and decreased demand <b>for</b> <b>Palestinian</b> workers in other Arab states combined to explain one-fifth to one-quarter of the decline in the wage gap from 1981 to 1987.

(Priority is given to holders of degrees in various {{scientific}} fields, and exception made <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> who are excluded unless married to a Saudi national, because of Arab League instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship.)

25|$|Abnaa el-Balad {{rejected}} the idea of working within Israel's parliamentary institution, the Knesset. By forming a network of local groups, they hoped to gain power and empower the community {{through the use of}} local municipal councils and popular activities. The movement's programme centered around self-determination <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> inside Israel, explicit support for the PLO, and the eventual establishment of a single democratic state in all of Palestine from the river to the sea.|$|E
25|$|According to The New York Times, {{many in the}} Arab world, {{including}} Egyptians, Palestinians, Lebanese and Jordanians, {{point to}} Sharon's visit {{as the beginning of}} the Second Intifada and derailment of the peace process. According to Juliana Ochs, Sharon's visit 'symbolically instigated' the second intifada. Marwan Barghouti said that although Sharon's provocative actions were a rallying point <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> the Second Intifada would have erupted even had he not visited the Temple Mount.|$|E

25|$|According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Israel {{would have}} {{withdrawn}} from 63 settlements. According to Robert Wright, Israel would only keep the settlements with large populations. Wright states that all others would be dismantled, {{with the exception}} of Kiryat Arba (adjacent to the holy city of Hebron), which would be an Israeli enclave inside the Palestinian state, and would be linked to Israel by a bypass road. The West Bank would be split in the middle by an Israeli-controlled road from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, with free passage <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> although Israel reserved the right to close the road to passage in case of emergency. In return, Israel would allow the Palestinians to use a highway in the Negev to connect the West Bank with Gaza. Wright states that in the Israeli proposal, the West Bank and Gaza Strip would be linked by an elevated highway and an elevated railroad running through the Negev, ensuring safe and free passage <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> This highway would be under the sovereignty of Israel, and Israel reserved the right to close the highway to passage in case of emergency.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} the Government of Israel is to {{condition}} the access of Palestinians {{who live in the}} Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage from the Palestinian Authority. In January 2009, following the war, the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients, and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region. This decision was protested by human rights organizations.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{during the}} First Intifada, Ofer Prison and Ktzi'ot Prison were rebuilt, and Megiddo Prison stopped {{accepting}} Israeli military prisoners and changed its designation as a full-fledged incarceration facility <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> Smaller detention facilities {{were built in}} the bases near Dhahiriya, Tulkarem, etc. A special department in the corps headquarters was created to deal with Palestinian prisoners, and a special forces unit called Force 100 was founded to deal with rebellions in the prisons, and operated until 2006. A professional course for jailors who worked in these prisons was also created.|$|E

25|$|No Arab country except Jordan has to date assimilated a {{significant}} population of Palestinian refugees, nor given them full citizenship, and many rely on economic {{aid from the}} UN or persons in other countries. It is the position of most Arab governments not to grant citizenship to the Palestinian refugees born within their borders; this policy is {{in part due to}} the wishes of these Arab states <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> to be allowed {{to return to their homes}} within Israel, in part due to these states wishing to relieve themselves of the refugees.|$|E
25|$|In the West Bank, {{collection}} of rainwater {{is a very}} limited resource in addition to tanker truck water <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> who lack connection to the water grid, notably in rural areas. However, Israeli authorities control even the {{collection of}} small quantities of rainwater. According to the 2009 report Troubled Waters by Amnesty International, some 180,000–200,000 Palestinians living in rural communities {{have no access to}} running water and the Israeli army often prevents them from even collecting rainwater. The Israeli army frequently destroys small rainwater harvesting cisterns built by Palestinian communities who have no access to running water, or prevents their construction.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians may {{not work}} in {{a large number of}} professions, such as lawyers and doctors. However, after {{negotiations}} between Lebanese authorities and ministers from the Palestinian National Authority some professions <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> were allowed (such as taxi driver and construction worker). The material situation of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is difficult, and they are believed to constitute the poorest community in Lebanon, as well as the poorest Palestinian community {{with the possible exception of}} Gaza Strip refugees. Their primary sources of income are UNRWA aid and menial labor sought in competition with Syrian guest workers.|$|E

On 25 October 2012, Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced that their respective political parties, Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu, had merged and would run together on a single ballot in Israel's 22 January 2013 general elections.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{attaches}} {{great importance}} to the finding of a just and final settlement to the Arab–Israeli conflict and supports initiatives to further the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, through {{the role of the}} Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process through its involvement in support of the Quartet (EU, US, Russia, UN), its programmes of humanitarian and other assistance <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, by virtue of the commitments entered into by Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the EU in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plans, as well as through programmes for civil society and people-to-people contacts.

25|$|A 2012 report jointly {{issued by}} aid {{organizations}} Save the Children and Britain's Medical Aid <b>for</b> <b>Palestinians</b> found that 10 percent of Gaza children under five had stunted growth due to malnutrition and that 68 percent of pre-school children and 58 {{percent of children}} of school age suffered from anaemia. The report stated that the five-year blockade of Gaza Strip, which has prevented importation of necessary supplies and materials, as well as Israel's Gaza War bombing of infrastructure, has led to water being severely contaminated by fertilizer and human waste. Diseases like typhoid and diarrhea, spread by contaminated water, have doubled in {{children under the age}} of 3, which has long-term health implications. Open sewage is a problem and in 2012 three children drowned in pools of it.|$|E
