5|$|With Hákon's passing Alexander III {{seized the}} initiative, and oversaw {{a series of}} invasions into the Isles and {{northern}} Scotland. Recognising this <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in royal authority, Magnús Óláfsson submitted to Alexander III within the year, and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles. The following year, Magnús died without a legitimate heir to succeed him, and {{proved to be the}} last ruling king of the Crovan dynasty. In 1266, Alexander III pacifically secured the Hebrides and Mann from Hákon's son and successor, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1280), by way of the Treaty of Perth.|$|E
5|$|Many castles still {{retained}} a defensive role. Castles in England, such as Chepstow and York Castle, were repaired and garrisoned by the king. As military technologies progressed {{the costs of}} upgrading older castles could be prohibitive – the estimated £30,000 required for the potential conversion of York in 1682, approximately £4,050,000 in 2009 terms, gives a scale of the potential costs. Castles played a minimal role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, although some fortifications such as Dover Castle were attacked by mobs unhappy with the religious beliefs of their Catholic governors, and the sieges of King John's Castle in Limerick formed part of the endgame {{to the war in}} Ireland. In the north of Britain security problems persisted in Scotland. Cromwellian forces had built a number of new modern forts and barracks, but the royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie and Ruthven Castle, also continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s; after the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt. In Ireland tower houses and castles remained in use until after the Glorious Revolution, when events led to a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in land ownership and a boom in the building of Palladian country houses; in many cases using timbers stripped from the older, abandoned generation of castles and tower houses.|$|E
25|$|The 1850 census saw a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> {{in the way}} {{information}} about residents was collected. For the first time, free persons were listed individually instead of by head of household. There were two questionnaires: one for free inhabitants and one for slaves.|$|E

25|$|The Kremlin's {{willingness}} to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental paradigm change in international relations, which until 1989 had {{been dominated by}} the East-West divide running through Berlin itself.

25|$|The Palaeolithic period, {{literally}} the “Old Stone Age”, {{is an ancient}} cultural level of human development characterized {{by the use of}} unpolished chipped stone tools. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic {{is directly related to the}} development of behavioural modernity by hominids around 40,000 years BP. To denote the great significance and degree of change, this <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic is sometimes called the Upper Palaeolithic Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Avner Offer’s and Gabriel Söderberg’s The Nobel factor: {{the prize}} in economics, social democracy, {{and the market}} turn (Princeton University Press 2016) argues {{that there has been}} a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in the {{dominant}} macroeconomic theories among the academia, and that the creation of the Nobel in 1969 was the cause of this, as it enhanced the prestige of free market ideology and conferred upon it the status of science.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, the American Medical Association adopted {{its first}} code of ethics, with this being based {{in large part}} upon Percival's work. While the secularized field {{borrowed}} largely from Catholic medical ethics, in the 20th century a distinctively liberal Protestant approach was articulated by thinkers such as Joseph Fletcher. In the 1960s and 1970s, building upon liberal theory and procedural justice, much of the discourse of medical ethics went through a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> and largely reconfigured itself into bioethics.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the workers}} on Garfield's first project, many workers at Grand Coulee Dam had brought dependents with them. The unions soon forced the Kaiser Company {{to expand its}} plan to cover dependents, which {{resulted}} in a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> from industrial medicine into family practice and enabled Garfield to formulate some of the basic principles of Kaiser Permanente. It was also during this time that Henry Kaiser personally became acquainted with Garfield and forged a friendship which lasted until Kaiser's death.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War precipitated a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in UN and {{multilateral}} peacekeeping. In a new spirit of cooperation, the Security Council established larger and more complex UN peacekeeping missions, often to help implement comprehensive peace agreements between belligerents in intra-State conflicts and civil wars. Furthermore, peacekeeping came to involve more and more non-military elements that ensured the proper functioning of civic functions, such as elections. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations was created in 1992 to support this increased demand for such missions.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in the United States, average retail (at the pump) prices, {{including}} {{federal and}} state fuel taxes, of B2/B5 were lower than petroleum diesel by about 12cents, and B20 blends {{were the same as}} petrodiesel. However, as part of a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in diesel pricing, by July 2009, the US DOE was reporting average costs of B20 15cents per gallon higher than petroleum diesel ($2.69/gal vs. $2.54/gal). B99 and B100 generally cost more than petrodiesel except where local governments provide a tax incentive or subsidy.|$|E

He focused on experimentation, guitar effects, tape looping, rhythm sequencing and sampling while developing his sixth studio album Propaganda, Chromosomes, Silicon. He sought a harder-hitting sound and headed a direction which was more into industrial music and alternative rock. Thematically it was a more personal and introspective record. Valdobrev’s lyrics have incorporated a variety of social, philosophical and political influences and appealed mainly to a vanishing counterculture in burgeoning hyper-consumerism.|$|E
25|$|The voter {{base of the}} GOP {{has been}} {{changing}} in directions opposite from national trends. It has become older and less Hispanic or Asian than the general population. Jackie Calmes has reported a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in the power base of the party, as it {{moves away from the}} Northeast and Pacific States and toward small-town America in the South and West. During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest. It has become more populist in its distrust of large corporations and of state and federal governments.|$|E

25|$|The <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> {{in prices}} mauled nominal wages - in the United States, nominal wages {{declined}} by one-quarter during the 1870s, {{and as much}} as one-half in some places, such as Pennsylvania. Although real wages had enjoyed robust growth {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War, increasing by nearly a quarter between 1865 and 1873, they stagnated until the 1880s, posting no real growth, before resuming their robust rate of expansion in the later 1880s. The collapse of cotton prices devastated the already war-ravaged economy of the southern United States. Although farm prices fell dramatically, American agriculture continued to expand production.|$|E
25|$|The Macedonians had {{developed}} their siege tactics under Philip. They {{had for the}} first time conducted successful sieges against strongly held and fortified positions. This was a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> from earlier warfare, where Greek armies had lacked the ability to conduct an effective assault. For instance, during the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans were never able to take Athens despite easily conquering her surrounding territory. For the task of breaching the walled fortifications of cities, Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts.|$|E
25|$|For {{their third}} LP, Construction Time Again, Depeche Mode worked with {{producer}} Gareth Jones, at John Foxx's Garden Studios and at Hansa Studios in West Berlin (where much of David Bowie's trilogy of seminal electronic albums featuring Brian Eno had been produced). The album saw a <b>dramatic</b> <b>shift</b> in the group's sound, {{due in part}} to Wilder's introduction of the Synclavier and E-mu Emulator samplers. By sampling the noises of everyday objects, the band created an eclectic, industrial-influenced sound, with similarities to groups such as the Art of Noise and Einstürzende Neubauten (the latter becoming Mute labelmates in 1983).|$|E
