5000|$|GW's US studio {{also ran}} for a while a biweekly online {{supplemental}} free e-zine Black Gobbo. It included two regular columns, [...] "Rules of Engagement" [...] and [...] "Ask the Scenery Guy," [...] to help answer gamers' questions. Similar to its printed counterpart, it was devoted to the <b>games</b> <b>and</b> <b>hobbies</b> created by GW. Just like its printed counterpart, Black Gobbo also has its own character, published on the web with its own article, rules, and modelling tips. The name is a pun. Gobbo stands for Goblin, which is hated by the Dwarfs. Dwarfs are, likewise, hated by Goblins. Black is also the opposite of white, hence Black Gobbo is {{the exact opposite of}} White Dwarf; one being free, electronic, short, weekly, black and a Goblin while the other one cost something, printed, comparatively long, monthly, white, and a Dwarf. The e-zine was cancelled in 2008 during the revision of GW's online strategy.|$|E

50|$|Players {{assemble}} {{and paint}} individual 28 mm scale miniature figures that represent futuristic soldiers, monsters and armoured fighting vehicles. These figurines are collected to constitute squads in armies {{that can be}} pitted against those of other players. Each player brings a roughly equal complement of units to a tabletop battlefield with handmade or purchased terrain. The players then decide upon a scenario, ranging from simple skirmishes to complex battles involving defended objectives and reinforcements. The models are physically moved {{around the table and}} the actual distance between models plays a role in the outcome of combat. Play is turn-based, with various outcomes determined by tables and the roll of dice. Battles may last anywhere from a half-hour to a whole weekend, and battles may be strung together to form campaigns. Many <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>hobby</b> stores host <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> official gaming events are held on a regular basis, such as the Throne of Skulls.|$|R

40|$|William Vickrey’s {{predicted}} equivalences between first-price sealed-bid and Dutch auctions, {{and between}} second-price sealed-bid and English auctions, are tested using field experiments that auctioned off collectible trading cards over the Internet. The {{results indicate that}} the Dutch auction produces 30 -percent higher revenues than the first-price auction format, a violation of the theoretical prediction and a reversal of previous laboratory results, and that the English and second-price formats produce roughly equivalent revenues. (JEL C 93, D 44) Perhaps the most fundamental result in the auction literature is the revenue equivalence theorem, which dates back to William Vickrey (1961). Comparing four different basic auction formats (English, Dutch, first-price, and secondprice auctions), Vickrey showed that in a simple model of Nash equilibrium bidding behavior, the expected revenue to be collected by the auctioneer will be the same under all four auction mechanisms. In this paper I report the results of Internet auctions of Magic game cards designed to test Vickrey’s predictions. In the Magic: the Gathering game scenario, players assume the roles of dueling wizards, each with their own libraries of magic spells (represented by decks of cards) that may potentially be used against the player’s opponent. Cards are sold in random assortments, just like baseball cards, at retail stores ranging from small <b>game</b> <b>and</b> <b>hobby</b> shops to large chains such as Toys “� ” Usan...|$|R
40|$|There {{was a need}} to {{determine}} the recreation needs of girls in the pre-adolescent age range of nine through fourteen years old so that municipal recreation professionals may program activities to meet the desires of this specific population. In order to do this, a testing instrument was developed. The test, a recreation preference schedule, used closed questions exclusively, unlike many of the available checklist surveys. The recreation preference schedule was modeled after the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule {{that was used in}} counseling. The new test, containing one hundred questions, utilized ten recreation activity categories. It was checked for reliability and validity, then administered to one hundred and forty-eight pre-adolescent girls enrolled in three elementary schools. A trend appeared that indicated pre-adolescent girls have a strong preference to engage in outdoor and nature activities that provide aesthetic qualities. They also desire social activities and sports activities that allow their individual abilities to surface. There was a marked rejection of non-active <b>games</b> <b>and</b> crafts <b>and</b> <b>hobbies</b> <b>and</b> a similar disinterest in dramatics. There appeared to be a middle-of-the-road attitude towards music, team sports and athletics, special events <b>and</b> active <b>games...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Elektor TV Games Computer (TVGC) was a {{programmable}} {{computer system}} sold by Elektor {{in kit form}} from 1979.

A 2K monitor ROM written by Philips and a cassette interface {{were the most important}} differences between the TVGC and the Interton family. Many VC 4000 games were adapted versions of TV Games Computer games.

50|$|The terms amateur and {{hobbyist}} {{are often}} used interchangeably. Stebbins has a framework which distinguishes the terms has a useful categorisation of leisure in which he separates casual leisure from serious Leisure. He describes serious leisure as that undertaken by amateurs, hobbyists and volunteers. Amateurs engage in pursuits that have a professional counterpart, such as playing an instrument or astronomy. Hobbyists engage in five broad types of activity: collecting, making and tinkering (like embroidery and car restoration), activity participation (like fishing and singing), sports <b>and</b> <b>games,</b> <b>and</b> liberal-arts <b>hobbies</b> (like languages, cuisine, literature). Volunteers commit to organisations where they work as guides, counsellors, gardeners and so on. The separation of the amateur from the hobbyist is because the amateur has the ethos of the professional practitioner {{as a guide to}} practice. An amateur clarinetist is conscious of the role and procedures of a professional clarinetist.|$|R
40|$|Nordsken {{is a game}} festival {{that shows}} the <b>game</b> <b>and</b> geek <b>hobby</b> to the public. Visitors can join in on tournaments and can try a large variety of {{computer}} <b>and</b> board <b>games.</b> Besides this, Nordsken invites different companies and lecturers who tell and show the best from the <b>game</b> <b>and</b> geek <b>hobby.</b> 600 participants gathered at Nordsken 2013 and over 1500 visitors came during these 3 days to play <b>games</b> <b>and</b> hangout with likeminded. As being responsible for Nordsken’s network, we had as a task to set up, configure and monitor the network during the entire event and act as support when needed. Ahead of the event a plan was introduced, which involved going through old documentation, buying a new server, renting switches and deployment of these devices. After a logical topology of the network was created, we began to configure all switches, wireless access points and the server. The network was split into three layers, core, distribution and access. The switches within each layer were configured depending on its location and connection. VLAN’s were created and configured into different sections based on {{the placement of the}} tables. On the server, we installed two virtual machines with Ubuntu 12. 04, one which included all the services and another which included all the management tools that were necessary. The services provided were DHCP for every VLAN, NAT for the Management VLAN and some firewall functionality. The tools that were used were Adiscon LogAnalyzer, FTP, Ubiquity Unifi Controller Software and Cacti with both the plug-ins, Thold and Monitor. Guides for installing and configuring these services are included in this thesis. All in all the event was a success when it comes to planning, installing, managing, and to take it down. The only big problem that occurred was that the wireless network didn´t function as well as we had hoped. We managed to solve the problem somewhat and the event went on as planned. The software that was installed and used on the server was chosen based on our past encounter with them during different labs at the university.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between adolescent leisure and gambling was explored. Three different models of time usage were compared as potential predictors of gambling behaviour and problem gambling among 769 adolescents (15 to 18 years old) from five secondary schools in Melbourne. More leisure time, particularly unstructured leisure, predicted more frequent gambling behaviour for girls and boys. Specific activity factors provided the best time usage-based prediction of gambling behaviour. More time socialising and being involved in organised sport predicted more gambling for boys, possibly because of the access these activities provide to gambling venues. For boys, lower levels of so-called masculine pursuits (activities with other male peers) were associated with problem gambling, as were 'cognitive pursuits' such as board <b>games</b> <b>and</b> collecting <b>hobbies.</b> For girls, more time in studious activity mitigated against gambling frequency. Lower levels of typically 'feminine' adolescent pursuits predicted problem gambling. By far the major predictor of problem gambling for both sexes was gambling frequency. The role of leisure in problem gambling was {{discussed in terms of}} the role played by peer socialising, which may increase risk through access to gambling venues yet simultaneously increase protection through a sense of belongingness...|$|R

40|$|Free time {{constitutes}} up to 50 {{percent of}} an adolescent's {{day and that}} young people have more leisure time than adults. Leisure may lead to boredom, {{a risk factor for}} problem gambling. Three different models of time usage were compared as potential predictors of gambling behaviour and problem gambling among 769 adolescents (15 - to 18 -years old) from five secondary schools in Melbourne. More leisure time predicted more frequent gambling behaviour for girls and boys, as did a greater amount of unstructured leisure time. Specific activity factors provided the best time usage-based prediction of gambling behaviour (accounting for approximately 20 percent of the variance for boys and 18 percent for girls). More time socialising and being involved in organised sport predicted more gambling for boys, probably because of the access these activities provide to gambling venues. For boys, low levels of the so-called masculine pursuits (activities with other male peers) were associated with problem gambling, as were 'cognitive pursuits' such as board <b>games</b> <b>and</b> collecting <b>hobbies.</b> For girls, more time in studious activity such as reading mitigated against gambling frequency. Low levels of typically 'feminine' adolescent pursuits predicted problem gambling. By far the major predictor of problem gambling however was gambling behaviour per se. The role of leisure in problem gambling was discussed in terms of the simultaneously protective and risk role by peer socialising, which may increase both access to gambling and a sense of connectedness to the peer group...|$|R
