5|$|<b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> is the {{temperature}} {{to which a}} given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is a saturation point. When the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> determines the specific humidity of the air. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|To left {{of center}} in the station model, the {{temperature}} and <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, {{they will be in}} units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal <b>dew</b> <b>point)</b> are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts.|$|E

25|$|Humidity in the {{mountains}} varies at wide levels as does rainfall. In the early morning before dawn, the air is almost saturated (often over 90% relative humidity) near the mountain tops with low clouds over the range. Lower in the range, air is not as near saturated in the morning. Seasonal variation in humidity is also present with average May and June relative humidity around 50%, with 25% possible during the day. Also during the day, relative humidity drops and cloud levels rise as temperatures rise. The humidity of the range is also influenced by the same seasonal changes as rainfall. In the dry season <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> are low at high elevations (500 hPa), around −22nbsp&°C {{in the south of}} the range and −24nbsp&°C to −26nbsp&°C in the north in May. In June, <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> begin to increase from the May levels up to −20nbsp&°C in the North and −16nbsp&°C in the south. By July these <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> are at −14nbsp&°C throughout the range. The range allows higher <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> throughout these periods than the surrounding low lands. This rise in humidity accompanies the monsoon.|$|R
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Heat bursts {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a {{rapid increase in}} temperature and decrease in <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> (moisture). Heat bursts typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} reactions have {{water as a}} product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> local condensation will occur.

5000|$|In the United States {{the most}} humid cities, {{strictly}} {{in terms of}} relative humidity, are Forks and Olympia, Washington. This fact {{may come as a}} surprise to many, as the climate in this region rarely exhibits the discomfort usually associated with high humidity. This is because high <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> play a more significant role than relative humidity in discomfort, and so the air in these western cities usually does not feel [...] "humid" [...] as a result. In general, <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> are much lower in the Western U.S. than those in the Eastern U.S.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} produce [...] "cycling dryers". These store a cold {{mass that}} cools {{the air when}} the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower <b>dew</b> <b>points,</b> typically in the 35-40 °F range. When selected with the optional [...] "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower <b>dew</b> <b>points.</b> Non-cycling dryers use a hot gas by pass valve to prevent the dryer from icing up.|$|R

25|$|Water vapor {{will only}} {{condense}} onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature, {{or when the}} water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, {{the temperature of the}} atmosphere drops slightly. In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.|$|E
50|$|Fall: Fall {{is marked}} by the first cold front that knocks the 100-degree {{temperatures}} down into the 90s. Foliage begins to change in late October. Temperatures cool down and <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> drop.|$|R
5000|$|Early on May 15, 1998, a {{stationary}} front was positioned {{from the western}} border of Minnesota, southward to Kansas. [...] To {{the east of the}} stationary front, temperatures and <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> were unseasonably high. Several Minnesota cities reported record high <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> (including the Twin Cities of 70 F) and low - minimum temperates for May 15. [...] A deepening area of low pressure over Kansas ejected to the north, moving along the stationary front. Behind the low pressure area was much cooler and drier air. [...] The clash of these two differing air masses was the impetus {{for the development of the}} severe weather.|$|R

25|$|Adiabatic cooling {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of three {{possible}} lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. If the air is cooled to its <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and becomes saturated, it normally sheds vapor it can no longer retain, which condenses into cloud. Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.|$|E
25|$|Typically, spacers {{are filled}} with or contain {{desiccant}} to remove moisture trapped in the gas space during manufacturing, thereby lowering the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of the gas in that space, and preventing condensation from forming on surface #2 when the outside glass pane temperature falls.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{adiabatic}} cooling {{that requires a}} lifting agent, there are three major non-adiabatic mechanisms for lowering {{the temperature of the}} air to its <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Conductive, radiational, and evaporative cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of fog.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the energy}} {{required}} in the paper drying process gives rise to substantial costs for the paper producing companies, it is {{of great interest to}} reduce the input of primary energy resources to the dryer. Either process changes or further heat recovery can be employed. A simulation tool was developed, using the programming tool Extend, with the aim to accurately describe the energy use and costs in different paper drying processes to make possible the evaluation of different process changes from an energy point of view. The tool was used to evaluate the total use of and costs for energy in a fictive conventional paper dryer at various <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> in the PM-hood air. Also the potentials for heat recovery were assessed. From the simulation results, the overall economics of the drying process at the various conditions were calculated. The overall energy efficiency was shown to increase with increasing <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> since the required energy for air heating was reduced and the potential for heat recovery was improved. The prices of energy resources were shown to have a large effect on the total economics of the drying process. For a dryer limited paper machine, the increased production at lower <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> was shown to increase the profitability of the paper machine...|$|R
50|$|On the 12:00 UTC surface chart, a {{cold front}} was draped from Minnesota {{southwest}} across Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and into Texas. A triple point was found {{just south of}} Des Moines, Iowa, with a warm front positioned east across northern Illinois and Indiana. Morning <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> ranged from 65 F at Saint Louis, Missouri, and Louisville, Kentucky, to 72 F at Memphis, Tennessee. 70 F or 71 F <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> were found in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Springfield and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Fort Campbell, Kentucky. An outflow boundary was draped over Central Illinois and Missouri from overnight convection that was decaying as it tracked east across the two states. This outflow boundary provided the potential for storms to redevelop.By mid-afternoon, temperatures at Carbondale, Illinois, and Marion had risen to {{the middle and upper}} 80s°F with <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> near 70 F. At 1:03 p.m., a tornado watch was issued for the region. Later in the afternoon the National Weather Service in Saint Louis, Missouri, issued several severe weather warnings for Williamson County and surrounding counties. At 2:58 p.m. a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for Jackson County and Williamson County. At 3:00 p.m, a tornado was observed near Carterville, Illinois, prompting a tornado warning at 3:19 p.m.|$|R
5000|$|On June 8, 1984, a {{negatively}} tilted trough {{caused an}} extratropical {{low pressure area}} to form over {{the coast of the}} Socialist Republic of Romania (now non-Communist Romania). Surface moisture moved north from the Black Sea and caused nearby <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> to rise to 20 C; though at that time these were restricted to Romania and the Ukrainian SSR, <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> were higher than average elsewhere. By 1800 UTC, developing thunderstorms over the Ukrainian SSR spread overnight into the Russian SFSR. Between 00 and 12 UTC on June 9, the strengthening low pressure area moved north-northeast over the northwestern Russian SFSR before undergoing occlusion. In the meantime, a strong cold front rapidly advanced along a line extending south from the surface low, then south of Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR (now Belarus), to near Bucharest. This front separated the drier air mass to the north from the warm, moist air mass near the Black Sea, and strong wind speeds near ground level caused vertical mixing. Therefore, <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> actually dropped before the first tornadoes formed, but nevertheless several factors overcame the lower <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> to produce tornadoes. Among these were a strong upper-level jet stream, clear skies causing daytime heating and instability, strong synoptic-scale lifting leading to ascension of updrafts, and high adiabatic lapse rates promoting thunderstorm development. All these factors combined to produce severe weather near Moscow. The tornadoes occurred in this region because an unstable and moist air mass, supported by warm sea surface temperatures over the Black Sea, had been in place four days before the outbreak began. The unusually strong intensity of the trough in the region on June 8-9, with a 500-millibar geopotential height measured at about 2.7 standard deviations below normal, also favored an intense tornado outbreak.|$|R
25|$|Also, a net {{condensation}} {{of water}} vapor occurs on surfaces {{when the temperature}} of the surface is at or below the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{content in}} the flue may produce visible fume from the stack, which can be {{perceived}} as a visual pollution. It may be avoided by decreasing the steam content by flue-gas condensation and reheating, or by increasing the flue gas exit temperature well above its <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Flue-gas condensation allows the latent heat of vaporization of the water to be recovered, subsequently increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} water vapor in an {{atmosphere}} is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. <b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice {{on top of a}} mountain.

A slight risk of severe weather was forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. <b>Dew</b> <b>points</b> above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|R
