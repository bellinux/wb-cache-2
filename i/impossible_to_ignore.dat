500|$|Bellman was a skilful and {{entertaining}} performer of his songs, accompanying {{himself on the}} cittern, putting on different voices, and imitating the sounds made by a crowd of people. He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in {{that almost all of}} his work was [...] "conceived to music". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The way he does this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility {{as if he had been}} a painter: [...] "An unusual swiftness of apprehension, both optical and aural, must have distinguished him." [...] Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that [...] "When [...] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains." [...] Jan Sjåvik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that [...] "Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [...] and raising it to a genre that became <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore,</b> while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage." ...|$|E

By the mid-19th century the issue of freeing the serfs had become <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> any longer if Russia was to be reformed and modernised. In 1861, Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom in Russia proper. The tsar also wanted to emancipate the serfs of Georgia, but without losing the recently earned loyalty of the nobility whose power and income depended on serf labour. This called for delicate negotiations and the task of finding a solution that would be acceptable to the land-owners was entrusted to the liberal noble Dimitri Kipiani. On 13 October 1865, the tsar decreed the emancipation of the first serfs in Georgia. The process of abolition throughout all the traditional Georgian lands would last into the 1870s. The serfs became free peasants who could move where they liked, marry whom they chose and take part in political activity without asking their lords' permission. The nobles retained the title to all their land but it was to be divided into two parts. The nobles owned one of these parts (at least half of the land) outright, but the other was to be rented by the peasants who had lived and worked on it for centuries.|$|E

5000|$|Berridge and {{colleague}} Dr. Terry Robinson have formulated a contemporary theory of addiction called the Incentive Sensitization Theory of Addiction. [...] According to this theory, drug addiction develops from a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Dopamine normally functions to attribute incentive salience to stimuli associated with rewards like food and sex, and triggers reward “wanting”. Drugs hijack this “wanting” system. Following repeated use of drugs, the dopamine system becomes hyper-responsive and drug cues become hyper-salient. This means drug cues are nearly <b>impossible</b> for addicts <b>to</b> <b>ignore,</b> {{and when they}} are encountered they can lead to intense cravings and/or relapse. This sensitized cue-triggered drug 'wanting' can persist for years after an addict quits drugs, and long after drug withdrawal has ceased. This fact may account for the tendency of former addicts to relapse to drug use after quitting, sometimes even after many years of abstinence.|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, the American critic Richard Brody wrote The Birth of a Nation was :"...a seminal {{commercial}} spectacle {{but also}} a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. It’s tempting {{to think of the}} film’s influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it’s even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie’s fabricated events shouldn’t lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn’t lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of Birth of a Nation, even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about The Birth of a Nation is how good it is.

40|$|Background: Recognizing {{an object}} {{requires}} binding together several cues, {{which may be}} distributed across different sensory modalities, and ignoring competing information originating from other objects. In addition, knowledge of the semantic category of an object is fundamental to determine how we should react to it. Here we investigate the role of semantic categories in the processing of auditory-visual objects. Methodology/Findings: We used an auditory-visual object-recognition task (go/no-go paradigm). We compared recognition times for two categories: a biologically relevant one (animals) and a non-biologically relevant one (means of transport). Participants were asked to react {{as fast as possible}} to target objects, presented in the visual and/or the auditory modality, and to withhold their response for distractor objects. A first main finding was that, when participants were presented with unimodal or bimodal congruent stimuli (an image and a sound from the same object), similar reaction times were observed for all object categories. Thus, there was no advantage in the speed of recognition for biologically relevant compared to non-biologically relevant objects. A second finding was that, {{in the presence of a}} biologically relevant auditory distractor, the processing of a target object was slowed down, whether or not it was itself biologically relevant. It seems <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>ignore</b> an animal sound, even when it is irrelevant to the task. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest a specific and mandatory processing of animal sounds, possibly due t...|$|R

Conceptions of unity are used as a heuristic device {{in order to examine}} the potential for their use in inter-religious dialogue. Challenges in the representation of exoteric forms of religious expression are considered and it is determined that, while it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> completely <b>ignore</b> the exoteric representations of religious practice, the primary focus must be on the transcendent and esoteric experiences of each tradition. One or two philosophers from each tradition are chosen because of their commitment to a particular tradition and systematic representation of the aforementioned experiences within. Thomas Merton, with his doctrine of Contemplation, represents the Christian tradition, Islam is represented by Ibn ?Arabi?s doctrine of the unity of being (wahdat al-wujud), and Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu represent the Taoist tradition with the Tao te Ching and other foundational texts. Their writings are then analyzed to determine if there are common expressions of unity found within each tradition. It is determined that there is a common emphasis in each tradition on the inability to perceive things as they really are, a reference to an absolute reality, a push to experience that reality, and a fundamental correlation between that experience and the actualization of human relationships. These concepts do not represent theological or philosophical equivalents, but, when used as a heuristic device, they do provide avenues to foster in depth inter-religious dialogue...|$|R

The ability to achieve this has been termed supply chain agility. Information and, importantly, agile information systems have been recognised as being a critical factor in achieving agility in the supply chain. To date studies have suggested that high levels of coordination between organisations, necessary for improved supply chain performance, demand high levels of integration between partners’ information systems. However, these high levels of integration reduce the ability to frequently and rapidly make changes to trading relationships, something that is a prerequisite of the agility paradigm. This paper seeks to explore how a number of emergent information systems offer the possibility of both deep integration and increased flexibility. This paper is exploratory in nature.
