5|$|Though different, the children's stories {{share similar}} structures. The story reaches its climax as a {{stairway}} {{appears at the}} Dream Gate and Helen and Nights ascend, only to be trapped by Wizeman and pulled into darkness. Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds {{that he has the}} ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. Both Will and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing as if it were the end of a performance, and the children wake up crying. That evening, Helen plays her violin for her mother in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As she closes his palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E
2500|$|In Natsu Ishō ( [...] , [...] "Summer clothing"), an elegantly-dressed woman {{standing}} in the foreground holds a kanzashi hairpin with her right <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hair, which is made up in a [...] hairstyle. [...] She appears to have just {{gotten out of the}} bath. [...] Another young woman looks at her from behind a translucent cloth hung on a clothes rack. [...] The pair appear to be in conversation.|$|E

2500|$|It is conjectured that Marguerite gave Anne the {{original}} manuscript of Miroir de l'âme pécheresse at some point. It {{is certain that}} in 1544, nine years after Anne Boleyn's execution by her husband Henry VIII, that Anne's daughter, who would become Elizabeth I (1533–1603), translated this very same poem by Marguerite into English prose as The Miroir or Glasse of the Synneful Soul when she was eleven years old and presented it, written in her own <b>hand,</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> then-stepmother, the English queen Katherine Parr. [...] This literary connection among Marguerite, Anne, Katherine Parr, and the future Queen Elizabeth I suggests a direct mentoring link between the legacy of reformist religious convictions and Marguerite.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} figure groups, one on the east {{and one on the}} west side of the monument. [...] The western group depicts War (presenting Sherman's epithet that [...] "War is hell!") as an older woman who is tearing asunder her {{clothing}} and the straps that bind her. She is trampling on the body of a dead soldier (who lies on his back), while a vulture perches behind her feet and another spreads its wings menacingly over the dead man. The mouth of a cannon can be see poking from below the dead man's legs. The eastern group depicts Peace as a young woman naked from the waist up, the flowering branch of a fruit tree in her left <b>hand.</b> <b>To</b> <b>her</b> left, a nude young girl tends a wounded young boy dressed in tattered pants (a depiction of the strong caring for the weak). To the woman's right, a nude boy lies in the grass feeding a bird.|$|E
2500|$|Santos {{is head of}} the Touch A Heart Foundation, {{launched}} in 2004. Her helping hand extends to the indigenous people, which addresses the education and agriculture needs of a community of Aetas in Bataan and provides medical supplies for the hospital in Cuyo Island, Palawan. Bringing her advocacy to the small screen in 2001, she played as an Aeta in Mugu-mugu!'s Maalaala Mo Kaya episode, titled [...] "Basket", to further raise awareness about the plight of the Aeta groups in the country. When it comes to giving a <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> colleagues in the business, Santos is a solid provider. Together with director Dante Nico Garcia, they launched the Ploning Foundation in February 2009 to inspire filmmakers to make quality projects intended for a global audience and to impart what the Ploning team learned during their Oscar campaign. It was also reported that Santos plans to work on a housing project to help revive the careers of veteran actors, small-time comedians and action film sidekicks. With so many people needing help in these times of economic hardship, Santos believes the country faces the challenge of leadership.|$|E
