25|$|Two weeks later, on 2 April, Racoon {{captured}} the privateer <b>felucca</b> Jean Baptiste, of 28 men. Three days later, Racoon captured another privateer <b>felucca,</b> this the Aventure, of one gun and 28 men. At {{about the same}} time Racoon re{{captured the}} Elizabeth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} from 20 May to 8 August, Swallow {{detained}} the Spanish <b>felucca</b> Baldenaro, which was carrying oil and wine.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September Flying Fish, Stork, Superieure, and Pike {{destroyed}} two privateers, names unknown, on the Jamaica station. One was a <b>felucca</b> of five guns.|$|E
60|$|The quick {{movement}} of suspicion {{made by the}} Bravo escaped the observation of the padrone, whose eye was running over the <b>felucca's</b> gear, with a sailor's habitual attention {{to that part of}} his vessel, when there was question of its service.|$|R
60|$|The gondolier {{laughed and}} nodded his head, {{as if he}} would give his {{companion}} to understand that he was master of her secret wishes. Annina was hesitating in what manner she should make him change his purpose, when the gondola touched the <b>felucca's</b> side.|$|R
60|$|The Bravo {{stepped into}} his gondola, which glided from the <b>felucca's</b> {{side with a}} {{facility}} which showed that an arm skilled in its use held the oar. He waved his hand in adieu to Stefano, and then the boat disappeared among the hulls that crowded the port.|$|R
25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed <b>felucca,</b> which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the <b>felucca</b> out, an operation they conducted under fire. The <b>felucca</b> was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E
25|$|Between 21 May and 8 August, Crescent, , and Nimrod {{captured}} two Spanish vessels: a Spanish <b>felucca</b> {{that was}} sailing from Havana to Vera Cruz, and a xebec sailing from Campeachy to Havana.|$|E
25|$|A <b>felucca</b> is a {{traditional}} wood-planked sailing boat used in protected waters of the Red Sea and eastern Mediterranean including Malta, and particularly along the Nile in Egypt. Its rig consists {{of one or two}} lateen sails.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will steer for Ancona, Signor Don Camillo," [...] {{said the}} Bravo, {{leaning on the}} <b>felucca's</b> side, still unwilling to depart, [...] "and throw {{yourself}} at once {{under the protection of}} the Cardinal Secretary. If Stefano keep the sea he may chance to meet the galleys of the Senate." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{there was}} no {{alternative}} save death, the survivors surrendered {{and a moment later}} were taken aboard the Amoz, the name that I could now see printed in large letters upon the <b>felucca's</b> bow, and which no one in that whole world could read except Perry and I.|$|R
6000|$|... § 15. From this point, also, {{the nature}} of the {{corresponding}} bastion, c d, Fig 33, is also discernible. It is the edge of a great concave precipice, cut out of the mountain, as the smooth hollows are out of the rocks {{at the foot of a}} waterfall, and across which the variously colored beds, thrown by perspective into corresponding curvatures, run exactly like the seams of canvas in a Venetian <b>felucca's</b> sail.|$|R
25|$|The French gunboat Légère was a <b>felucca</b> {{that the}} French Navy {{commissioned}} in August 1794 at Toulon. The Royal Navy captured her in September 1798 {{and took her}} into service as HMS Legere. The Royal Navy disposed of her by 1803.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August Maitland {{was again}} {{in command of}} Camelion. On that day he was captain of Cameleon when she {{captured}} the Corsican privateer <b>felucca</b> Providence. Providence, of Bastia, was armed with two guns and carried a crew of 23 men.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} between 28 February and 20 May 1800, Nimrod {{captured}} the Spanish <b>felucca</b> Victoria, which was sailing from Tobasco to Jamaica with a cargo of specie, logwood, and cochineal. It {{is not clear}} who her commander was {{while she was in}} the Caribbean.|$|E
60|$|Before {{taking down}} the spar and sail, he had deliberated {{as to whether}} {{it would be better to}} run before the coming gale or to lie to, and had decided on the latter alternative, as, were it to {{continue}} to blow long, he might be driven on to the Egyptian coast. Moreover, the <b>felucca's</b> bow was much higher out of water than the stern, and he thought that she would ride over the waves with greater safety than she would did they sweep down upon her stern.|$|R
60|$|The decks of la Divina Providenza were reeking with blood, and grape and {{canister}} were {{sticking in}} handfuls {{in different parts}} of the vessel. Three dead bodies were found in her hold, but nothing having life was met with on board. There was a tar-bucket filled at hand, and this was placed beneath the hatch, covered with all the combustible materials that could be laid hold of, and set on fire. So active were the flames at that dry season that Raoul regretted he had not taken the precaution to awaken them after he had removed his own vessel; but the southerly air continuing, he was enabled to get to a safe distance before they actually ascended the <b>felucca's</b> rigging and seized upon her sails.|$|R
60|$|It was {{fortunate}} Ithuel {{was known to}} be such a determined hater of the English, else might his life have been the forfeit of this seeming act of treachery. But he meditated no such dereliction of duty. Perfectly aware of the impossiblity of preventing his men from firing, did they possess the means, this deliberate and calculating personage had resorted to this expedient to reserve his own effort, until, in his judgment, it might prove the most available. His men murmured, but, too much excited to deliberate, they poured in a discharge of musketry, as the only means of annoying the enemy then left them. Even Raoul glanced aside, a little wondering at not hearing the <b>felucca's</b> carronades, but perceiving her people busy with their fire-arms, he believed all right.|$|R
25|$|On 4 June Minorca, with Wormley in command, {{captured}} the French privateer <b>felucca</b> Sans Peur. She was armed with one long gun and two swivel guns. She and her crew of 39 {{men had been}} out of Genoa for 35 days but had captured nothing.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 1805 boats from Loire {{captured}} the Spanish privateer <b>felucca</b> Esperanza alias San Pedro in the Bay of Camarinas, east of Cape Finisterre. She was armed with three eighteen-pounders, four four-pounder brass swivels and {{a crew of}} 50 men. Loire had only three men slightly wounded. The captured Spanish crew had lost 19 of their 50 men, mostly killed by pike and sword; some however jumped overboard.|$|E
25|$|Later, Acasta {{captured}} a 16-gun xebec carrying wine, brandy and dry goods. She had no papers {{and so the}} endpoints of her voyage were unknown. She ran onshore off of {{the east end of}} Puerto Rico where Acastas boats got her off. Next, Acasta took the Spanish <b>felucca</b> Jesus Maria y San Josef, which was sailing from Cadiz bound to San Juan with dry goods, steel and paper.|$|E
60|$|And, now {{the fear}} of danger was past, it was a sight truly to be enjoyed. Every anxious and curious face in the lugger was to be seen, under that {{brilliant}} light, turned toward the glowing mass as the sunflower follows the great source of heat in his track athwart the heavens; while the spars, sails, guns, and even the smallest object on board the lugger started out of the obscurity of night into the brightness of such an illumination, as if composing parts of some brilliant scenic display. But so fierce a flame soon exhausted itself. Ere long the <b>felucca's</b> masts fell, and with them a pyramid of fire. Then the glowing deck tumbled in; and, finally, timber after timber and plank after plank fell, until the conflagration, in a great measure, extinguished itself in the water on which it floated. An hour after the flames appeared little remained but the embers which were glowing in the hold of the wreck.|$|R
25|$|In September Cameleons cutter and {{jolly boat}} {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Richard Spencer and master's mate Charles Royer brought {{off from the}} beach near Tarragona a Spanish <b>felucca</b> mounting two 6-pounder guns and two swivel guns. The felluca {{was one of three}} that had run ashore at the approach of the boats. The British threw overboard the guns on the other two feluccas when small arms fire from soldiers on the beach prevented the British from getting the vessels.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1806, Captain John Ayscough assumed {{command of}} Success. Early on 20 November 1806, while {{just east of}} Guantánamo Bay (known as Cumberland Harbour to the British), Ayscough {{observed}} a <b>felucca</b> running into Hidden Port. He sent the ship's barge and yawl in pursuit, but on reaching the shore they discovered that about 50 armed men had landed from the <b>felucca,</b> which was lashed to a tree, and had taken a position {{at the top of}} a small hill overlooking the beach, upon which they had mounted a single long gun. They fired grape and ball down on the British, killing the First Lieutenant, Mr. Duke, with their first volley. The British withstood the enemy fire for an hour and twenty minutes, suffering seven more men wounded, and having the barge shot through in several places before Lieutenant Spence, then in command, deemed any attempt on the hill a useless sacrifice, so ordered the enemy ship to be towed out, which was achieved under heavy fire. She proved to be the French privateer Vengeur, which had sailed from Santo Domingo on 1 October, but being badly damaged she sank while under tow.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1805, Crofton and Racoon {{were in the}} {{anchorage}} at Montego Bay {{when they}} sighted an enemy schooner boarding a drogger. Racoon gave chase but in the light winds was unable to catch up before the privateer and his prize reached Cape Cruz. On {{her way back to}} resume her station, Racoon encountered and captured the Spanish privateer <b>felucca</b> San Felix El Socoro, out of Santiago de Cuba. He had 40 men aboard and was armed with one 6-pounder gun that he had thrown overboard during the chase. The privateer had been out 11 days but had only captured a drogger.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March 1809, Argos boats {{cut out the}} French navy <b>felucca</b> Joseph. Joseph {{was armed}} with a brass 9-pounder gun and two 3-pounders. She had a crew of 53 men {{under the command of}} Enseign de Vaisseau Jean Botin. Joseph was {{anchored}} under the guns of several shore batteries at St. Domingo. Her crew put up a strong resistance that, together with the fire from the batteries, wounded seven of Argos men. However, most of the French crew then fled ashore with the result that Argo only captured 19 of them. Joseph arrived at Jamaica on 5 April.|$|E
25|$|The US {{ordered an}} attack on Lafitte's colony. On September 13, 1814 Commodore Daniel Patterson set sail aboard the USS Carolina for Barataria. He was {{accompanied}} by six gunboats and a tender. The fleet anchored off Grande Terre and the gunboats attacked. By midmorning, 10 armed pirate ships formed a battle line in the bay. Within a short period, Lafitte's men abandoned their ships, set several on fire, and fled the area. When Patterson's men went ashore, they met no resistance. They took 80 people captive, but Lafitte escaped safely. The Americans took custody of six schooners, one <b>felucca,</b> and a brig, as well as 20cannon and goods worth $500,000.|$|E
25|$|From 29 April 1802 until 1809 Peterel {{was under}} Commander John Lamborn. In May 1804, she sailed for Jamaica and Barbados, convoying the West Indies trade, and {{thereafter}} {{remained in the}} West Indies for some years. She destroyed a small privateer on the Jamaica station on 23 January 1805. The privateer was a <b>felucca,</b> armed with one 4-pounder gun and a swivel gun. She had a crew of 27 men, all except one of whom escaped after they ran her on shore and before Peterels boats arrived to burn her. The privateer had captured an American brig which she had sent into Havana where the brig was sold.|$|E
25|$|Barceló sailed from Cartagena on July 2 {{ahead of}} 4 ships of the line, 4 frigates and 68 small vassels, {{including}} gunboats and bomb vessels. The Algerines {{had no more}} than 2 demi-galleons of 5 guns each, a <b>felucca</b> of 6, two xebecs of 4 guns each, and 6 gunboats carrying 12 and 24 pounders to oppose them. On 29 July the Spanish fleet came in sight {{of the town and}} two days later Barceló formed his line of battle and made the necessary dispositions for the attack. The bomb-ketches and gunboats, supported by xebecs and other vessels, formed the vanguard, the whole being covered by the ships of line and frigates.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December Minorca {{captured}} a Spanish merchant vessel. As Minorca was entering the Straits of Gibraltar {{on her way}} to join her station at Gibraltar, 11 privateers came out to reconnoitre her. Waldegrave immediately gave chase, causing them to disperse, though the largest one attempted to separate Minorca from her prize. After a two-hour chase, Waldegrave was able to capture the largest, the Nuestra Señora del Carmen (alias Caridad). She was armed with two 12-pounder guns, two 4-pounder guns, and two large swivel guns; she had a crew of 35 men. Minorca also {{captured a}} Spanish <b>felucca,</b> the packet boat on the Tangiers to Tarifa route, together with the mail that she was carrying.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} eight days, seven additional attacks were ordered. The Algerians had placed {{a line of}} barges armed with artillery that largely prevented the Allied gunboats getting close to their objectives. A shot fired from the fortifications hit the <b>felucca</b> from which Barceló were directing the bombing, sinking it. José Lorenzo de Goicoechea came {{to the aid of}} the admiral, who was rescued unscathed. Passing immediately to another boat, Barceló continued leading the attack, downplaying the importance of the incident. Finally, on 21 July, it was decided to end the attack. Contrary winds forced Barceló to give the order to return to Cartagena. More than 20,000 cannonballs and grenades had been fired on the enemy, causing severe damage to the fortifications and the city, and sinking or destroying most of the Algerian vessels. The Allied casualties were 53 men killed and 64 wounded, most of them due to accidents.|$|E
25|$|Ottavio d'Aragona {{set sail}} to the Aegean Sea {{in command of}} his eight galleys. South of Samos, the Spanish Admiral was {{informed}} by Greek fishermen {{of the presence of}} 10 Ottoman galleys under Sinari Pasha in the surrounding area. The squadron crossed the Mycale Strait thanks to the help of an able Greek and arrived off Cape Corvo, where the Ottoman fleet was anchored: it was positioned with two galleys in the vanguard, two forming the main battle group, and three in the rear-guard. D'Aragona, having been warned of the presence of Sinari Pasha's vessels by a <b>felucca</b> previously detached ahead his fleet, ordered the attack, and followed by his squadron, approached the Ottoman formation and rammed its flagship. After three hours of combat, Sinari Pasha surrendered his galley, and was followed by his second-in-command and five other galleys. The remaining three managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|The landing party {{consisted}} of 63 officers and men, {{none of whom}} were from Pike. Ten men from Flying Fish remained to guard the party's boats. The party landed on 2 September and crossed some two miles of marshy ground to storm a fort at Batabano. On their way they had to break through an ambush of enemy soldiers and militia. In the process they killed two and wounded one badly. At the fort they captured six 18-pounder long guns, which they spiked. The party then proceeded to take possession of the vessels in the bay. There is some disagreement as to how many vessels they captured and took as prizes, with the total rising as high as 12. According to Rushworth's letter (an after action report), the prizes included a <b>felucca,</b> pierced for 14 guns but only mounting one 18-pounder, a schooner pierced for 12 guns, a French 4-gun privateer, and three Spanish privateers of one gun each. The party also burnt at least six smaller coasting vessels after having removed their cargoes. Total British casualties amounted to one man badly wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Between 21 May and 8 August, Nimrod, , and [...] {{captured}} two Spanish vessels: a Spanish <b>felucca</b> {{that was}} sailing from Havanah to Vera Cruz, and a xebec sailing from Campeachy to Havana. Nimrod and Crescent also captured or detained three other Spanish vessels: a <b>felucca</b> carrying wax, a xebec carrying hides and leather, and a schooner sailing from Saint Domingo to Curacoa carrying mahogany.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 March, boats from Apollo and [...] {{destroyed}} several vessels, {{a battery}} and a tower three {{miles northwest of}} the port of Monopoli near Bari. Then on 11 April, Apollo and Cerberus took Devil's Island, near the north entrance to Corfu, and thereby captured a brig and a trabaccolo bringing in grain. On 14 April the boats chased a vessel into Merlera. They then suffered three men wounded before Apollo arrived and captured the island. The British found eight vessels with flour and grain that the enemy had scuttled. Ten days later, [...] Apollos boats chased a <b>felucca</b> into St Cataldo that had troops aboard. A landing party of marines killed one Frenchman, wounded another, and captured 26. (The rest of the troops and {{the crew of the}} <b>felucca</b> fled.) Apollos boats brought out the <b>felucca.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In October 1804, {{or perhaps}} earlier, Lieutenant William Carr, of , {{replaced}} Lawrence, who transferred to [...] On 4 October, Netley captured a small privateer, the French <b>felucca</b> San Benita, of one gun and 28 men.|$|E
