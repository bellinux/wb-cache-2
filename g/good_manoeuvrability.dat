25|$|The Port Victoria P.V.5 was a British single-engined {{floatplane}} fighter aircraft of the First World War. A single {{example was}} built and flown at the Royal Naval Air Service's Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain in 1917. Despite demonstrating <b>good</b> <b>manoeuvrability</b> and handling, no production followed, with the Royal Naval Air Service instead using landplanes for the fighter role.|$|E
25|$|Still believing {{this could}} be improved, and after {{examining}} more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and <b>good</b> <b>manoeuvrability</b> {{would make it easier}} to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} formalised in January 1943 when the Air Ministry issued Specification F.2/42 around the [...] "Tempest Light Fighter". This was {{followed}} up by Specification F.2/43, issued in May 1943, which required {{a high rate}} of climb of not less than 4,500ft/min (23m/s) from ground level to 20,000feet (6,096m), <b>good</b> fighting <b>manoeuvrability</b> and a maximum speed of at least 450mph (724km/h) at 22,000feet (6,705m). The armament was to be four 20mm Hispano V cannon with a total capacity of 600 rounds, plus the capability of carrying two bombs each up to 1,000pounds (454kg). In April 1943, Hawker had also received Specification N.7/43 from the Admiralty, who sought a navalised version of the developing aircraft; in response, Sidney Camm proposed the consolidation of both service's requirements under Specification F.2/43, with the alterations required for naval operations issued on a supplemental basis. Around 1944, the aircraft project finally received its name; the Royal Air Force's version becoming known as the Fury and the Fleet Air Arm's version as the Sea Fury.|$|R
500|$|The antbirds are a {{group of}} small to {{medium-sized}} passerines that {{range in size from}} the large giant antshrike, which measures 45cm (18in) and weighs 150 g (5.29 oz), to the tiny 8-cm (3in) pygmy antwren, which weighs 7 g (0.25oz). In general terms, [...] "antshrikes" [...] are relatively large-bodied birds, [...] "antvireos" [...] are medium-sized and chunky, while [...] "antwrens" [...] include most smaller species; [...] "antbird" [...] genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide <b>good</b> <b>manoeuvrability</b> when flying in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate ant-followers. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and saplings, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. Tarsus length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the Thamnophilus antshrikes that forage by perch-gleaning (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the Thamnomanes antshrikes.|$|E

A high manoeuvrability and hovering capacities are required to perform complex explorations and monitoring tasks: that is why a motion control based on lateral and vertical thrusters has been preferred with respect to the typical use of control surfaces, also in order to have a more reliable system as concerns component failures.

40|$|To {{meet the}} demands for {{increasing}} the speed and improving the seakeeping behaviour of commercial and naval ships, this thesis investigates {{a new type of}} ship configuration - The Trimaran Displacement Ship, it features a slender centre hull and two small side hulls. The design methodology and hydrodynamic performance of this new ship concept has been investigated through design studies, model experiments and theoretical analysis. Potential advantages of the trimaran ship are, lower wavemaking resistance at high speed, larger deck area, and improved seakeeping behaviour compared with existing ship types. Firstly, existing marine vessel types, both monohulls and multihulls, are reviewed with regard to their advantages and limitations. The new trimaran concept and its background is then described from its initiation by a desire of inheriting advantages and avoiding limitations of these existing ship types. Namely, achieving the low resistance of slender monohulls and large deck area of multihulls, whilst eliminating the speed limit of conventional monohulls and the stiff roll motion of catamarans. The review of the trimaran ships design studies shows the potential applications of this new concept in commercial and naval roles. The feasibility of the new concept and the methodology required for its design are investigated through the concept design studies of. a trimaran fast ferry (Figure 1) and the hull form design for a trimaran model ship (Figure 2) for seakeeping experiments. This provides an initial view on the design procedure and basic design considerations for the trimaran ship. The parametric study in the trimaran ferry design gives the basic parameters for trimaran hull forms. Hydrodynamic performance of the trimaran ship has been investigated through model experiments and theoretical analysis on seakeeping, resistance, and <b>manoeuvrability.</b> <b>Good</b> agreements between theoretical predictions and model experiments have been achieved. This shows the merit of the computer programs developed during the investigation so they can be used in future trimaran ship designs for hydrodynamic performance assessments. A three dimensional theory is used in the trimaran motion analysis. Roll damping characteristics of the trimaran ship has been examined by including viscous effects in roll damping which can be derived either by simulating damping data from free decay experiments or by direct computation, that has been shown to improve the roll motion predictions. Systematic investigation into the wavemaking resistance of the trimaran ship reveals the relationship between the side hull configuration and the resistance performance. Wave cancellation effects can be achieved when the side hulls are appropriately located to further reduce the wavemaking resistance of the trimaran ship. A manoeuvrability study concentrated on the effect of the side hulls on the turning ability of the trimaran ship as well as the effect of side hull propulsion. Following the hydrodynamic analysis of the trimaran ship, the design procedure and general considerations in trimaran ship design distinctive from other ship types are proposed and discussed with particular reference to stability and hydrodynamic performance. Trimaran hull form options are also discussed alongside some other design considerations. The thesis concludes that the new trimaran displacement ship shows superior characteristics in some hydrodynamic aspects over existing marine vessels, particularly in resistance and seakeeping, and therefore {{there is no reason why}} this novel concept can not be translated into real ships...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the first}} trials {{it was evident}} that the C.202 was an {{advanced}} design, mainly because of the use of the Daimler Benz DB 601, a departure from the standard practice of using engines of Italian origin. Test results showed that Italy had caught up with Britain and Germany in the field of fighter airplanes. The prototype differed in some respects from the production aircraft; the headrest fairing incorporated two windows for rear visibility, while production versions replaced this with a narrower, scalloped headrest. The square-sectioned supercharger air intake was replaced by an elongated round sectioned fairing, which was later redesigned to incorporate a dust filter. The prototype was flown to the Regia Aeronauticas main test airfield at Guidonia, where it met with an enthusiastic response from test pilots. A speed of 603 km/h (375 mph) was recorded, with 5,486 m (18,000 ft) being reached in six minutes and little of the <b>good</b> <b>manoeuvrability</b> of the C.200 was lost.Another of its attributes was its extremely strong construction that allowed its pilots to dive the aircraft steeply.Due to the flight test reports, the C.202 was immediately ordered into production with the first examples (built by Macchi as Serie II) appearing in May 1941. The complexity of the structure was not well suited to mass production, and resulted in a limited production rate compared to the Bf 109E/F (usually rated at 4,500-6,000 man-hours) while the Macchi needed 22,000 or more. The growth of the C.202 project was slower than that of the Re. 2001; but, by employing both mass production techniques and less expensive advanced technologies, the production cost was slightly less than that of the Reggiane Re.2001, (525,000 lire vs 600,000); this latter, the only other DB 601 fighter in mass production, was slower and heavier (2.460/3.240 kg) [...] but had a bigger wing and a more advanced and adaptable structure.
