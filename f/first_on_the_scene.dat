25|$|The {{only person}} {{actually}} tried was Castner Hanway, a European-American man. On 15 November 1851 he was tried for liberating slaves {{taken into custody}} by U.S. Marshal Kline, {{as well as for}} resisting arrest, conspiracy, and treason. Hanway's responsibility for the violent events was unclear. He was reported as one of the <b>first</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> where Gorsuch and others of his party were attacked, and he and his horse provided cover for Dickerson, Gorsuch and Dr. Pearce, who were wounded. The jury deliberated 15 minutes before returning a Not Guilty. Among the five defense lawyers, recruited by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, was U.S. Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who had practiced law in Lancaster County since at least 1838.|$|E
25|$|St. Julien {{undertook}} {{the study}} of chemistry beginning in 1852. However, he did not completely forsake his previous work. When an outbreak of Yellow Fever struck Norfolk, Virginia in 1855, {{he was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and worked throughout the epidemic to aid the patients. At his Stony Landing Plantation along the Cooper River, he experimented with the production of lime from marl deposits located along the river banks. After cement was discovered under the limestone layers, in 1856 he partnered with Clement H. Stevens to establish the Colleton Lime Works at his plantation which sold lime for 0.90c per barrel. This company would provide most of the lime used by the southern states during the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the narrow road. United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} <b>first</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E

When a police artist (Chad Cleven) draws an image of the man, his real name is {{revealed}} to be Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), another detective who took over Michael's spot at the police department after the crash, now working with Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's former partner in the [...] "red reality" [...] and his current one in the [...] "green reality". Michael meets with Bird and Hawkins and the latter says {{that he was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of the crash and that he is sorry about Rex's death. Michael starts to believe that his son is really dead; he remembers the crash, yet again, with additional information. Michael realizes that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the crash. As soon as he figures out the situation, Michael wakes up with Rex and Emma; he is relieved to see Rex. After the carnival, Michael phones Dr. Evans to tell her what he now knows about the crash.|$|E

English spinner John Emburey was <b>first</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and thumped Darling on the chest, allowing him to breathe again.

[...] White meant the Communist's philosophy of branding anyone opposed to their platform was their failure.
