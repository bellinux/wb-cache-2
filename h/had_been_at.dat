Nadal won both, with the latter described {{as one of the}} greatest tennis matches of all time.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> two and three.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, as he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> Mantua, Klenau {{was caught in a}} siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the British and French <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> war {{for seven}} years and the British {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every French port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control of the seas, the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1906, Mahler had been {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna {{at the close of}} the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E

5|$|De Grasse {{ordered his}} fleet {{to prepare for}} action, and {{on the morning of}} April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships hugging the coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing toward them around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> St. Lucia. The two fleets {{continued}} to push for advantageous positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position. Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain and France <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> war {{for more}} than two years by April 1795, and British {{dominance}} at sea was well established, with the Royal Navy maintaining substantial blockade fleets off all of the principal French naval ports. The biggest port on the French Atlantic coast was at Brest in Brittany, from which French raiders could attack British shipping in the English Channel and Western Atlantic. The most efficient commerce raiders were frigates, light and fast warships that could strike rapidly and with devastating effect if left unopposed. One of the major roles of the British blockade squadrons was the detection and elimination of French frigates as they emerged from their bases.|$|E
5|$|Halotus died {{sometime}} {{in the latter part}} of the 1st century. At the time of his death, he still held the procuratorship that he had been granted by Galba. He kept this position despite Galba's unseating very soon after it was bestowed and the political uproars of The Year of the Four Emperors. At the time of his death, Halotus' public reputation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> least partially restored and he had accumulated some degree of wealth after he had been cleared by Galba. Details relating to his death are not recorded in any of the writings of ancient historians, and neither are any specific dates.|$|E

During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E

He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking to.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials questioned about 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance.
