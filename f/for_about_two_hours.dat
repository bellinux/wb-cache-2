5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship.|$|E

Thomas had with him items including an Australian-issue passport, an airline ticket for travel to Indonesia, and about $ 3,800 in cash. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001. He was blindfolded, and driven to an unknown location, where he was questioned <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> by two Pakistani men and two Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E

50|$|The Hong Moh sailed from Hong Kong on 2 March 1921, {{bound for}} Swatow, {{under the command}} of Henry William Holmes, with a crew of 48 and 1,135 {{passengers}} aboard. When she arrived off Swatow {{on the morning of the}} 3rd, the ship anchored off Bill Island and signalled for a pilot to take her in. When the pilot arrived he informed the master that his ships draught was too great to cross the bar, so the ship set a course <b>for</b> Amoy. <b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> later, at 7.20 p.m., in rough seas and poor visibility, the ship struck the north-west point of the White Rocks.

50|$|Boeing Boeing is {{a classic}} French farce for the stage by Marc Camoletti. Utilizing most of the {{conventions}} of bedroom farce's canon, it concerns a Parisian bachelor playboy with three international air stewardess fiancées he secretly keeps in careful rotation, until their flight schedules change and he, along with his provincial friend and sassy maid, must keep them from finding out about each other. Luckily they have enough doors in the apartment to keep the girls unwittingly flitting <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R
500|$|<b>About</b> <b>two</b> dozen wigs {{are used}} for the actresses. Made of human hair and up to [...] in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs is time-consuming; Emilia Clarke, <b>for</b> example, {{requires}} <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner, receive frequent hair coloring.

50|$|After the cakalang (Minahasan for {{skipjack}} tuna) fish {{has been}} cleaned (scaled and gutted), {{the flesh of}} cakalang is split into two parts and clipped upon a bamboo frame that has been prepared previously. Then the fish meat is cured using soda powder, salt and some spices for flavouring. The cakalang meat later undergoes the smoking process, the heat of fire and smoke must be evenly distributed so that all parts of fish {{are exposed to the}} heat, done and dried. The tuna meat curing process takes about four hours and the time needed <b>for</b> cooling is <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> The process goes on until the color of skipjack tuna turns reddish and the meat texture is rather dry and not watery.|$|R
50|$|Intermediate-term memory (ITM) is a {{stage of}} memory {{distinct}} from sensory memory, working memory/short-term memory, and long-term memory. While sensory memory persists for several milliseconds, working memory persists for up to thirty seconds, and long-term memory persists from thirty minutes {{to the end of}} an individual's life, intermediate-term memory persists <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> to three <b>hours.</b> This overlap in the durations of these memory processes indicates that they occur simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Indeed, intermediate-term facilitation can be produced in the absence of long-term facilitation. However, the boundaries between these forms of memory are not clear-cut, and they can vary depending on the task. Intermediate-term memory is thought to be supported by the parahippocampal cortex.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} busbar caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> the {{two sides}} faced {{each other across the}} {{clearing}} as Banks waited for more of his troops to arrive and Taylor arranged his men. At that point, Taylor enjoyed a numerical advantage over Banks. At about 4:00 pm, the Confederates surged forward. On {{the east side of the}} road, Mouton was killed, while several of his regimental commanders were hit as well and the charge of his division was repulsed. However, west of the road, Walker's Texas division wrapped around the Union position, folding it in on itself. Ransom was wounded trying to rally his men and was carried from the field; hundreds of Union troops were captured and the rest retreated in a panic. As the first Union line collapsed, Cameron's division was arriving to form a second line but it too was pushed back by the charging Confederates, with Franklin wounded as well but remaining on the field in command. For several miles the Confederates pursued the retreating Union troops until they encountered a third line formed by Emory's division. The Confederates launched several charges on the Union line but were repulsed, while nightfall ended the battle.|$|E

5000|$|The {{persistence}} hunt {{is still}} practiced by hunter-gatherers {{in the central}} Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa, and David Attenborough's documentary The Life of Mammals (program 10, [...] "Food For Thought") showed a bushman hunting a kudu antelope until it collapsed.It is thought that the Tarahumara natives of northwestern Mexico in the Copper Canyon area may have also practiced persistence hunting. The procedure is not to spear the antelope or kudu from a distance, but to run it down in the midday heat, <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> to five <b>hours</b> over 25 to 35 km in temperatures of about 40 to 42 C. The hunter chases the kudu, which then runs away out of sight. By tracking it down at a fast running pace the hunter catches up with it before it has {{had enough time to}} rest in the shade. The animal is repeatedly chased and tracked down until it is too exhausted to continue running. The hunter then kills it at close range with a spear.|$|R
25|$|There is {{not much}} data on the {{reproduction}} of A. ocellaris. However, similar behaviors throughout all anemone fishes have been recorded. These fish have monogamous mating systems, and are territorial of their anemone. Males become more aggressive during spawning. Male behavior also changes to attract females: biting, chasing, fin extension. Before spawning, the male prepares the nest near the anemone (so that the tentacles of the anemone can protect the nest). After the male chases the female to the nest, the female begins the spawning process. She lays eggs <b>for</b> <b>about</b> one to <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> and then leave the nest for the male to fertilize the eggs. The eggs take approximately six to eight days to hatch (this time period can {{be affected by the}} temperature of water). Because of the external fertilization, males usually care for the eggs. They also have responsibilities for eating fungi-infected or infertile eggs, and fanning the eggs.|$|R
25|$|By 7:00 a.m. Albertone was {{arraying}} {{his remaining}} battalions {{on the nearby}} Mount Semaiata, leaving Turitto and the two batteries on the Kidane Meret to cover his movements. He wrote a message to Baratieri, informing {{him that he was}} under heavy attack and in dire need of reinforcements: it would reach the commander only at 8:15. From 7:30, the 1st Native Battalion held off increasing numbers of enemy troops until 8:30, when it was forced to retreat. At this time, about 18 thousands Ethiopians were converging on Albertone's brigade in an half moon formation, trying to encircle it, and the strong Ethiopian northern wing occupied Mount Gusoso, cutting any existing link between Albertone and Dabormida's relif attempt. <b>For</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> the ascari under Albertone held their position, the artillery inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers, but then the Ethiopians set up quick-firing batteries on the Kidane Meret. While Menelik was committing more troops from his own command, the badly mauled flanks of the Native Brigade collapsed, and by 10:30 the whole brigade, low on ammunition, started a fighting retreat that soon turned into a rout. The batteries that tried to cover the withdrawal were captured, retaken by ascari with a bayonet charge, then definitely lost, their crews annihilated. Albertone was captured leading his troops, and his brigade shattered shortly afterwards.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{mechanical}} and triboloical properties of powder metallurgy (PM) parts under different process parameters, the specimens were used in pack carburizing processes. These specimens made from industrial test pieces were carburized in a powder pack <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> to five <b>hours</b> at a temperature of about 850 ?C - 950 ?C. The effects of austenitization and quenching are investigated on some specimens. Also the wear tests are performed {{by means of a}} pin-on-disc tribotester using roll bearing steel as the counterface material. The results indicate that by appropriate selection of process parameters, it is possible to obtain high wear resistance along with moderate toughness. It is concluded that surface treatments increases the wear resistance and performance of PM parts in service conditions. By increasing the role of PM in industry which resulted from their ability to produce the complex shapes, high production rate, and dimension accuracy of final products, they need to be heat treated. Carburizing method was selected as a surface hardening method for PM parts. Results of wear and hardness show considerable enhancement in mechanical properties of PM parts...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacological {{disposition}} of chloramphenicol was studied in horses. Minimum {{levels of the}} antibiotic (greater {{than or equal to}} 5 mu g/ml) in blood or plasma recommended to combat infections could not be achieved by 4. 4 and 8. 8 mg/kg I. V. or 30 and 50 mg/kg I. M. or 30 mg/kg oral (as palmitate salt) doses of chloramphenicol. Increasing the dose to 19. 8 and 26. 4 mg/kg I. V. provided such levels <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> and three <b>hours</b> respectively. A combination of 20 mg/kg I. V. and 30 mg/kg I. M. administered simultaneously did not provide more prolonged levels than 26. 4 mg/kg I. V. alone. Chloramphenicol succinate produced higher but not more prolonged levels in blood and plasma than those produced by pure chloramphenicol. Succinate salt is very little, if at all, bound to red blood corpuscles. Plasma half life and the apparent volume of distribution of chloramphenicol in horses were determined as 0. 98 hours and 0. 92 L/kg, respectively. At 5 - 10 mu g/ml concentrations in equine plasma approximately 30 percent of the chloramphenicol is bound to plasma proteins. From these studies it is concluded that the biological half life of chloramphenicol may be too short for therapeutic application against systemic infections in horses...|$|R
30|$|After the {{post-mortem}} examination, the veterinary officers pass a judgement on {{the slaughter}} stock {{on whether it}} is fit for human consumption or not. The judgement stage is marked {{by the use of}} an edible red marker ink on the carcass that is passed fit for human consumption being roller stamped. The veterinary officers can pass their judgement on whether meat is fit for human consumption in two ways: either passing the meat unconditionally or passing the meat conditionally. The meat is passed unconditionally, when the inspectors have examined the carcass and passed it fit for human consumption without any conditions attached. They can also pass the meat conditionally when examination reveals the presence of parasitic cysts like Cysticercus bovis. The conditions are that when 1 to 5 cysts of the parasites are found, the meat is passed on condition that it is treated first either through sterilization (treating by steaming, boiling in a closed vault <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> and half <b>hours</b> at 770 C or rendering especially for pork) by heat or a cold treatment (freezing for 10  days at −[*] 10 degrees centigrade) of the meat before consumption and the infested parts are removed from the meat as well.|$|R
