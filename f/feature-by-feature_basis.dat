Most analysis at this stage is on <b>feature-by-feature</b> <b>basis.</b> That initial information is used to create a structural model of the face, which allows it to be compared to other faces in memory, and across views. This explains why the same person seen from a novel angle can still be recognized. This structural encoding can be seen to be specific for upright faces as demonstrated by the Thatcher effect. The structurally encoded representation is transferred to notional [...] "face recognition units" [...] that are used with [...] "personal identity nodes" [...] to identify a person through information from semantic memory. The natural ability to produce someone's name when presented with their face has been shown in experimental research to be damaged in some cases of brain injury, suggesting that naming may be a separate process from the memory of other information about a person.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Image feature {{descriptors}} {{composed of}} a series of binary intensity comparisons yield substantial memory and runtime improvements over conventional descriptors, but are sensitive to viewpoint changes in ways that vary per feature. We propose a method to improve the matching performance of such descriptors by specifically reasoning about the reliability of test results on a <b>feature-by-feature</b> <b>basis.</b> We demonstrate an intuitive method to learn improved descriptor structures for individual features. Further, these learned results can be efficiently applied during matching with little increase in runtime. We provide an evaluation using a standard, ground-truthed, multi-image dataset. I...|$|E
40|$|The current {{virtualization}} {{solution in}} the Cloud widely relies on hypervisor-based technologies. Along {{with the recent}} popularity of Docker, the container-based virtualization starts receiving more attention for being a promising alternative. Since both of the virtualization solutions are not resource-free, their performance overheads would lead to negative impacts {{on the quality of}} Cloud services. To help fundamentally understand the performance difference between these two types of virtualization solutions, we use a physical machine with "just-enough" resource as a baseline to investigate the performance overhead of a standalone Docker container against a standalone virtual machine (VM). With findings contrary to the related work, our evaluation results show that the virtualization's performance overhead could vary not only on a <b>feature-by-feature</b> <b>basis</b> but also on a job-to-job basis. Although the container-based solution is undoubtedly lightweight, the hypervisor-based technology does not come with higher performance overhead in every case. For example, Docker containers particularly exhibit lower QoS in terms of storage transaction speed.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the version- 5 precipitation radar (PR; algorithm 2 A 25) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI; algorithm 2 A 12) rainfall products is performed across the Tropics in two ways: 1) by comparing long-term TRMM rainfall products with Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) global rain gauge analyses and 2) by comparing the rainfall estimates from the PR and TMI on a rainfall <b>feature-by-feature</b> <b>basis</b> within the narrow swath of the PR using a 1 -yr database of classified precipitation features (PFs). The former is done to evaluate the overall biases of the TMI and PR relative to ‘‘ground truth’’ to examine regional differences in the estimates; the latter allows a direct comparison of the estimates with the same sampling area, also identifying relative biases {{as a function of}} storm type. This study finds that the TMI overestimates rainfall in most of the deep Tropics and midlatitude warm seasons over land with respect to both the GPCC gauge analysis and the PR (which agrees well with the GPCC gauges in the deep Tropics globally), in agreement with past results. The PR is generally higher than the TMI in midlatitude cold seasons over land areas with gauges. The analysis by feature type reveals that the TMI overestimates relative to the PR are due to overestimates in mesoscale convective systems and in most features with 85 -GHz polarization-corrected temperature of less than 250 K (i. e., with a significant optical depth of precipitation ice). The PR tended to b...|$|E
40|$|We discuss accent {{mixture and}} the {{creation}} of idiosyncratic phonological systems in acquisition, with a focus on Scottish English. Such mixing is in addition to the relatively stable sociolinguistic systems of variation expected within a speech community, and arises when parents have radically different accents from each other or from the child’s peers or other adult models. In terms of traditional geographic dialectology, {{there are a number of}} isoglosses around the Scotland/England border, but modern social mobility means that in some Scottish cities there are large numbers of families with at least one non-Scottish adult accent acting as a model for acquisition, which may feed into phonological change. Of particular interest is the influence of Southern British English accents. We exemplify the issues with two short case studies. The first concerns a child with mixed Scottish/English input in the home. His speech patterns do indeed indicate the acquisition of a mixed system. The second focuses on inter-sibling variation, looking at two sibling pairs who exemplify a different mix of accent features from each other. We examine two main diagnostics: monophthongal vs. diphthongal productions of the vowels in FACE and GOAT; and rhoticity. We also describe a parental demographic and accent attitude questionnaire as part of Case Study 2. The results support the need for speaker-by-speaker study of how incompatibility between two target systems is handled. We conclude that descriptions of mixed accents should be more common in the literature and approached on a <b>feature-by-feature</b> <b>basis</b> to help develop models of accent interference...|$|E
