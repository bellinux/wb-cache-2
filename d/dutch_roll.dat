5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a <b>dutch</b> <b>roll</b> had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{testing and}} {{evaluation}} {{showed that the}} aircraft had poor handling, being unstable laterally, prone to <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> and to severe flexing of the rear fuselage. Following a forced landing it was rebuilt incorporating recommendations made in reports from Ministry test pilots to try to resolve these problems, and was powered by Kestrel III engines. It was then given the name Vickers Vanox by Vickers.|$|E
25|$|Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing {{swept back}} at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident {{has the same}} {{sweepback}} angle, while the Boeing 727 has a slightly smaller sweepback angle of 32°. The wing also has anhedral (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also have weaker <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> tendencies.|$|E

500|$|B-52s {{prior to}} the G models had very small ailerons with a short span that was {{approximately}} equal to their chord. These [...] "feeler ailerons" [...] were used to provide feedback forces to the pilot's control yoke and to fine tune the roll axes during delicate maneuvers such as aerial refueling. Due to twisting of the thin main wing, conventional outboard flap type ailerons would lose authority and therefore could not be used. In other words, aileron activation would cause the wing to twist, undermining roll control. Six spoilerons on each wing {{are responsible for the}} majority of roll control. The late B-52G models eliminated the ailerons altogether and added an extra spoileron to each wing. Partly {{because of the lack of}} ailerons, the B-52G and H models were more susceptible to <b>dutch</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E

60|$|Presently I {{got into}} {{what seemed a}} small city or {{community}} of chiffoniers. There {{were a number of}} shanties or huts, such as may be met with in the remote parts of the Bog of Allan--rude places with wattled walls, plastered with mud and roofs of rude thatch made from stable refuse--such places as one would not like to enter for any consideration, and which even in water-colour could only look picturesque if judiciously treated. In the midst of these huts was one of the strangest adaptations--I cannot say habitations--I had ever seen. An immense old wardrobe, the colossal remnant of some boudoir of Charles VII, or Henry II, had been converted into a dwelling-house. The double doors lay open, so that the entire ménage was open to public view. In the open half of the wardrobe was a common sitting-room of some four feet by six, in which sat, smoking their pipes round a charcoal brazier, no fewer than six old soldiers of the First Republic, with their uniforms torn and worn threadbare. Evidently they were of the mauvais sujet class; their bleary eyes and limp jaws told plainly of a common love of absinthe; and their eyes had that haggard, worn look of slumbering ferocity which follows hard in the wake of drink. The other side stood as of old, with its shelves intact, save that they were cut to half their depth, and in each shelf of which there were six, was a bed made with rags and straw. The half-dozen of worthies who inhabited this structure looked at me curiously as I passed; and when I looked back after going a little way I saw their heads together in a whispered conference. I did not like the look of this at all, for the place was very lonely, and the men looked very, very villainous. However, I did not see any cause for fear, and went on my way, penetrating further and further into the Sahara. The way was tortuous to a degree, and from going round in a series of semi-circles, as one goes in skating with the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll,</b> I got rather confused with regard to the points of the compass.|$|E
6000|$|People to whom cold means misery, {{who hate}} to be braced, and shudder at the word [...] "seasonable," [...] can have little {{difficulty}} in accounting for {{the origin of the}} sports of winter. They need only adapt to the circumstances that old Lydian tradition which says that games of chance were invented during a great famine. Men permitted themselves to eat only every second day, and tried to forget their hunger in playing at draughts and dice. That is clearly the invention of a southern people, which never had occasion to wish it could become oblivious of the weather, as too many of us would like to be in England. Such shivering and indolent folks may be inclined to say that skating and curling and wildfowl-shooting, and the other diversions which seduce the able-bodied from the warm precincts of the cheerful fire, were only contrived to enable us to forget the state of the thermometer. Whether or not that was the purpose of the first northerner who fixed sheep-bones beneath his feet, to course more smoothly over the frozen sound, {{there can be no doubt}} that winter sports answer their presumed purpose. They keep up that glow which only exercise in the open air can give, and promote the health which shows itself in the complexion. It is the young lady who interprets literally the Scotch invitation [...] "come into the fire," [...] and who spoils the backs of library novels by holding them too near the comfortable hearth, she it is who suffers from the ignoble and unbecoming liberties that winter takes with the human countenance. Happier and wiser is she who studies the always living and popular <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> rather than the Grecian bend, and who blooms with continual health and good temper. Our changeful climate affords so few opportunities of learning to skate, that it is really extraordinary to find so much skill, and to see feats so difficult and graceful. In Canada, where frost is a certainty, and where the covered [...] "rinks" [...] make skating an indoor sport, it is not odd that great perfection should be attained. But as fast as Canadians bring over a new figure or a new trick it is picked up, and critics may dispute as to whether the bold and dashing style of the English school of skaters is not preferable to the careful and smooth, but somewhat pretty and niggling manner of the colonists. Our skating stands to the Canadian fashion somewhat as French does to English etching. We have the dash and the chic with skates which Frenchmen show with the etching-needle, and the Canadian, on the other hand, is apt to decline into the mere prettiness which is the fault of English etchers.|$|E
50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll.</b> A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll.</b> The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the spiral}} mode {{has a long}} time constant, the pilot can {{intervene}} to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> {{would be difficult to}} fly. It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of [...] "tail-wagging" [...] and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.|$|E

50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll,</b> {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> is solved by installing a yaw damper, in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll.</b> If the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the <b>Dutch</b> <b>roll</b> stability is improved.|$|E
