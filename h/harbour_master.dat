5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (<b>Harbour</b> <b>Master)</b> at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E

Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master</b> who escorted them to the Harbour Master's Office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master</b> and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father John E.

25|$|In 1908, the sampan-men of Penang harbour went on strike. Looking {{in on the}} situation, Bland {{determined}} {{the need for a}} broader and deeper investigation into the complaints of the sampan-men, and the public who complained about their unusual charges. In December 1908, the Government acted on Bland's suggestion and a Committee comprising Judge L. E. P. Wolferstan (Chairman), <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master</b> Commander D. C. MacIntyre R.N.R., and Assistant Protector of Chinese David Beatty was appointed to enquire into the complaints of the sampan men of Penang.|$|E
25|$|Captain Schettino {{participated in}} three {{telephone}} calls with the cruise line's crisis management officer. At 22:26, Schettino told the Port of Livorno's <b>harbour</b> <b>master</b> {{that the ship}} had taken water through {{an opening in the}} port side and requested a tug boat. Port authorities were not alerted to the collision until 22:42, about an hour after the impact, and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until 22:50. Some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore, while others, ready to evacuate the vessel, were delayed by crew members up to 45 minutes, as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats. Some sources report that the ship did not list until 23:15 and therefore if Schettino had given the order to abandon ship, the lifeboats could have been launched earlier, allowing the passengers to reach safety. In contrast, one expert stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving.|$|E

25|$|After World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Millais was taken into the secret service of the Royal Navy in Norway and in Iceland. As he later {{explained}} in his autobiographical book Wanderings and Memories, {{he was involved in}} counter-espionage, provided with the rank of Lieutenant-Commander and was appointed British Vice-Counsul at Hammerfest in northern Norway where he stayed until 1917. In August 1915 he met with two German spies at Christiania, and travelled with them to Lofoten. He was engaged in setting up and supporting a network of counter espionage. The importance of Norway to the war effort was that the northern seas provided a route for food and materials to reach British ports. Millais reported from Norway that whilst the Norwegian authorities were generally pro British, much of the population were pro German. In December 1917 he was nearly captured by the Germans but {{with the help of a}} <b>harbour</b> <b>master</b> he managed to get out of Norway, returning to Newcastle.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 a {{plan was}} drafted by Generalleutenant Graf von Schmettow to hit back at the Americans occupying the Cherbourg peninsula. Using a number of ships rescued from St Malo and with the {{additional}} objective of boosting morale of German soldiers in the Channel islands a detailed plan was created using information from German prisoners {{who had been in}} Granville and stole a landing craft LCV(P) to escape. Training exercises were undertaken by 800 men in Guernsey, away from the civilian population to avoid the plans being revealed. Work on the ships also had to be kept away from the SS Vega in case the preparations were reported. An idea that a raid was being planned was noticed and a message was sent from Guernsey to France with an escaping OT worker, Xavier Gollivet, who had worked for the German <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master</b> and two local fisherman, Tom and Jack Le Page, it would be ignored. A false start on 6 February due to fog, also risked disclosure of the attack.|$|E
25|$|The most sensational ghost story, and {{one that}} {{developed}} rapidly in form {{from the time of}} its first telling in the mid 1990s, is the story of Hannah Watson and her lover. Hannah, the wife of Captain Thomas Watson, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master</b> of Port Jackson, according to the legend, {{was having an affair with}} Captain John Steane of the Royal Navy. Thomas Watson, on discovering his wife's infidelity, cursed the lovers. Hannah wrote to Steane, begging him not to return to Sydney, but it was too late. Hannah Watson died and was buried in the cemetery. John Steane outlived Hannah by only a few days. The ship in which he was returning to the arms of his beloved was the ill-fated Dunbar. John Steane's body was one of the few that were recovered intact. It is buried in a separate grave near the Dunbar Tomb, and only a few metres from the plot where Thomas Watson had recently buried his wife. It is claimed that Hannah Watson has been seen emerging from her tomb in the form of a ghostly grey lady. She is said to drift slowly to the grave of her erstwhile lover. Although the tale has been told many times, and has been used as the basis for a work of fiction, no investigation into the possibility of a love-affair between Hannah Watson and Captain John Steane has yet been made. John Steane's descendants continue to live in the vicinity of Newtown.|$|E

500|$|In 1836, the {{surveyor}} Thomas Watson {{returned to}} area and used Bald Hill {{as the principal}} trigonometric reference. Watson was to map {{out a number of}} lots in the area including the western boundary for Beverley town site. Two of the lots surveyed were Avon location 14 with , and Avon location K with location 14 was given to Captain Mark Currie, Fremantle <b>Harbour</b> <b>Master,</b> while location K was given to Stirling. Stirling as Governor and Currie as <b>harbour</b> <b>master</b> were not paid salaries by the colony but given land grants as compensation for their services. In 1978, surveyors using current equipment were engaged to determine the exact location of these original holdings, and commented on the remarkable accuracy of Watson's survey 142 years before.|$|E
500|$|It was Henrik Ruse, a Dutch {{building}} engineer, who {{was charged}} by Frederick III {{to develop the}} area around Kongens Nytorv, especially {{in connection with the}} Nyhavn Canal which was designed to become Copenhagen's new harbour. It was not, however, until Christian V became king in 1670 that Niels Rosenkrantz completed the work. [...] Over the next few years, numerous town houses were built along the northern or sunny side of the canal. The oldest, Number 9, was completed in 1681, probably by Christen Christensen, the <b>harbour</b> <b>master.</b>|$|E

Melbourne Star, Port Chalmers and Rochester Castle reached Grand Harbour at Valletta at 16:30, where Operation Ceres, the immediate unloading of the ships began. Another air attack at dusk by 14 Ju 87s, sank Dorset but when the main body was within [...] of Malta, 18 Ju 88s were recalled {{in the face of}} 407 Spitfire sorties from the island. Penn tried to tow Ohio but the tanker was listing and snapped the tow line and in a later attack, a bomb hit the same area as a previous torpedo hit and broke Ohios keel. The last ship to arrive, Brisbane Star evaded a U-boat and managed to steam at [...] despite the damage to its bows. Off Tunisia, Brisbane Star was attacked by two SM.79 torpedo bombers, whose torpedoes turned out to be duds. The ship evaded Italian MAS boats; it was then boarded by the Sousse <b>harbour</b> <b>master,</b> who tried to impound the vessel until persuaded to relent and let the ship sail on after dark. Ledbury was attacked by two SM.79s but shot them down. Force X had turned for Gibraltar at 16:00 with the cruisers Charybdis, Kenya and five destroyers and Fliegerkorps II made a maximum effort against the force, which made it easier for the remaining merchant ships to reach Malta. Force X was attacked by 35 Ju 88s and 13 Ju 87s, achieving only a near-miss on Kenya for a loss of one Ju 88 and one Stuka. The Regia Aeronautica attacked with 15 bombers and 20 torpedo-bombers for no loss and during the afternoon, Force X met Force Z, the ships being attacked by aircraft, submarines and light craft and Foresight was scuttled by Tartar when it could no longer sail. Eskimo and Somali, carrying survivors from Manchester were the last to reach Gibraltar at 17:30 on 15 August.|$|E
