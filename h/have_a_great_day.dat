40|$|FULL TITLE: Ideal Classmates and Reciprocal Idealizing through Critical Participatory Looping (CPL) in Socially Intelligent Dynamic Systems (SINDYS) Tim Murphey {{describes}} an easy action research/activity {{done in the}} spring of 2012 with 488 students in four Tokyo area Japanese universities. It had a big impact on the students and could easily be replicated in other classrooms, in almost any school situation. Murphey’s Tokyo research group asked students the following question: # 39 Please describe a group of classmates that you could learn English well with. What would you all do to help each other learn better and more enjoyably? いっしょに親しく英語を学ぶクラスメートのグループがどのようなものかを想像して書いてみて下さい。より上手に楽しく助け合って学ぶにはどうすればいいでしょうか。 Their answers were so interesting that the researchers first compiled them anonymously on a handout and gave them back to each class for discussion. Then the 488 comments were coded into 16 descriptors and looped back to the same students a month later to ask if these indeed were important, if their classmates were doing them, and if they were doing them. The positive results can be understood partially through the field of Appreciative Inquiry, emotional contagion (Hatfield, et al., 1994), the altruistic turn, dynamic systems theory, and critical participatory looping. Teachers will be given practical ideas for doing these and similar things in the classroom.

5000|$|What would {{eventually}} be named the [...] "NFL's comeback of the year" [...] was played on Monday Night Football on October 16. Late in the third quarter, the massive underdog Arizona Cardinals led the Chicago Bears 23-3. Arizona {{seemed to have the}} game wrapped up, as rookie quarterback Matt Leinart was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day,</b> and Arizona <b>had</b> forced six turnovers out of Chicago quarterback Rex Grossman. Chicago's defense then went on to score 14 points on fumble returns for touchdowns. With 2:58 left in the fourth quarter, and down 17-23, Chicago's Devin Hester returned a punt for a touchdown to take a 24-23 lead. Leinart then led the Cardinals down the field, only to have Neil Rackers miss a field goal, and Chicago went on to win.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the date}} of the {{surviving}} manuscripts, a version of the Táin may have been put to writing already in the eighth century. There is reason to suspect that the Táin <b>had</b> <b>a</b> considerable oral history before any of it was committed to writing: for example, the poem Conailla Medb michuru ("Medb enjoined illegal contracts") by Luccreth moccu Chiara, dated to c. 600, tells the story of Fergus' exile with Ailill and Medb, which the poet describes as sen-eolas ("old knowledge"). Two further seventh-century poems also allude to elements of the story: in Verba Scáthaige ("Words of Scáthach"), the warrior-woman Scáthach prophesies Cú Chulainn's combats at the ford; and Ro-mbáe laithi rordu rind ("We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> of plying spear-points"), attributed to Cú Chulainn himself, refers to an incident in the Boyhood Deeds section of the Táin.|$|R

All who were in my class (nine), or the Sunday morning school, were baptized in the evening. While we were standing round the font, I thought of you at home, and half wished that you could have seen us there.

The event was documented by participant observation, photographs, video, a guest book and opinions from Lene Storgaard from Amfiteatret.

5000|$|Freshman and Sophomores again {{accounted}} {{for all of}} Notre Dame's scoring, highlighted by a second straight 100 -yard game by Michael Floyd, who had 5 catches for 115 yards and a 48-yard touchdown catch. Sophomore running back Armando Allen amassed 153 total yards, including scoring a 3-yard rushing touchdown and a 21-yard touchdown pass from Clausen. Freshman tight end Kyle Rudolph also had 5 catches for 70 yards and a touchdown. Running back Toby Gerhart <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> running the ball for the Cardinal, compiling 104 yards on 13 carries. Tavita Pritchard, however, turned the ball over 3 times, throwing interceptions to Notre Dame safeties David Bruton and Kyle McCarthy in addition to Kuntz. Before the game, Stanford offensive lineman Chris Marinelli made some controversial comments about Notre Dame(which he later apologized for), saying that [...] "I hate it, playing Dame up there.

In 2012, when basketball was taken away from him due to surgery, Clarke began to doubt his faith. [...] "There was a time I definitely doubted God," [...] he recalls. [...] "I left my family. I left my friends. I left diehard fans who just wanted to see me succeed ... It was the ultimate low for me." [...] After some soul searching, he concluded his doubts were a [...] "mistake".

It's easy to praise him in success, but when you are really going through a struggle or something really tough in your life, I feel like I blame God.

50|$|June 4, 2007 - Mark Ellis was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> for {{the entire}} game vs. the Boston Red Sox. After hitting a triple {{in the bottom of}} the 2nd which gave the A's the lead, he would hit a home run in the fourth, and a double in the sixth. With a chance to hit for the cycle {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, Ellis {{grounded}} the ball into a fielder's choice and was not awarded a single, despite that no one was out as a result of the play. With the <b>A's</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> 4-2 lead it seemed like Ellis would not hit for the cycle. However, the Red Sox would tie the game in the top of the ninth, and the A's were unable to break the tie in the bottom of the inning. This was a blessing in disguise as Mark Ellis had another chance to hit for the cycle, which he did with a single to midfield. He was the sixth player in the Oakland Athletics to hit for the cycle (not including when the A's were in Philadelphia and Kansas City). Eric Chavez, who has also hit for the cycle in 2000, won the game with a solo home run in the 11th.|$|R

25|$|Some pros {{always had}} {{problems}} with how the ABA decided its number one pros for the year {{going back to the}} 1979 season. The biggest complaint that it was canted to have the points work out so that the number one pro would almost certainly be decided going into the ABA's Grand National in November with the lion's share of the points being doled out then (the points that were earned was {{the amount of money that}} was earned through the year. At that time the ABA AA pro who won the most money was declared No. 1 pro). The pros claimed that this benefited the ABA since it meant an exciting finish to the season, but it was detrimental to the pros in that a season of consistent wins and near wins could be undone by <b>having</b> <b>an</b> off day and/or a normally inconsistent rider <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> and capturing the number one plate. Other issues like a bigger pro purse and that the purse be spread out over eight places instead of the top four at ABA Nationals which would ensure anyone making the pro main would get a share of the winnings were also a factor. The claim was while NBL, NBA and independent promotional races' purses have gone up over the years, the ABA's purses had remained relatively stagnant.|$|R
