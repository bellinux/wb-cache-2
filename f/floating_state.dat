We find two characteristic interface atomic structures in {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} images: One is an interface in which the density of atoms at the first interfacial SiC bilayer is greater than that in the SiC substrate, while the other is an interface where the density of atoms at the first interfacial SiC bilayer is lower. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the difference in the scanning transmission electron microscopy images {{is a reflection of the}} atomic structures of these two interfaces. In addition, it has been reported that the <b>floating</b> <b>states,</b> which appear at the conduction band edge of a 4 H-SiC(0001) /SiO 2 interface, affect the electronic structure of the interface and cause marked scattering of the electrons flowing along the interface [S.

40|$|We report first-principles electronic-structure {{calculations}} that {{clarify the}} floating nature of electron states in covalent semiconductors. It is found that wave functions of several conduction- and valence-band states, including the conduction-band minima, do not distribute near atomic sites, as {{was taken for}} granted, but float in interstitial channels in most semiconductors. The floating states have a nearly-free-electron(NFE) -like character, and extend in the channels broadly without atomic-orbital characters. The electrostatic potential at the channels and the directions and shapes of the interstitial channels depend on the crystal symmetry so that mysterious variation of the energy gaps in silicon carbide (SiC) polytypes is naturally explained by considering the floating nature. In addition, {{we have found that}} the floating states are closely related to the anisotropy in effective masses in SiC. It has been found that most conduction-band minima have floating nature. The existence of the <b>floating</b> <b>state</b> comes from the internal space in the crystal structures, and non-spherical charge distribution. The substantial band-gap variation in SiC has been analyzed by an empirical parameter "hexagonality" for a half century. Yet, we have clarified that the parameter "hexagonality" is a misleading parameter. Instead, we have found that a new parameter "channel length", which represents the spatial extension of the <b>floating</b> <b>state,</b> is essential in describing the band-gap variation in SiC. In addition, we have performed the linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO) calculations and compared the results with those calculated by the plane-wave-basis set. It is found that the floating characters in the electron states are difficult to be pursued in the LCAO calculations. We have also examined the floating states in pressurized sp 3 -bonded materials. We have also found that the energy bands with floating character manifest different behavior from other bands with atomic-orbital character under the pressurized circumstances. 報告番号:; 学位授与日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科物理工学専...|$|E
30|$|Operation {{strategy}} of BESS {{refers to the}} power and time periods of battery charging and discharging [12]. In planning phase, BESS charging and discharging power of each period are usually taken as decision variables, globally optimized based on objective function. Compared to the fixed operation strategy, though this global optimization approach can obtain global optimal solution in theory, the dimension of programming model greatly increases and the computation speed is slow. On the other hand, in practical application, real-time control for BESS {{requires a lot of}} information exchanges and advanced communication equipment as supports, resulting in poor economy. Different from the approach of global optimization, some boundary values are set in this paper. When external conditions meet boundary constraints, BESS starts to charge or discharge, otherwise it goes into <b>floating</b> <b>state.</b> Moreover, in order to obtain the optimal solution, these boundary values cannot be fixed artificially beforehand but optimized in the simulation operation.|$|E

While neutral squirmers permanently float above the wall with upright orientation, pullers float for α larger than a threshold value α_th and are pinned to the wall below α_th.

30|$|A {{seed layer}} is {{required}} to fabricate ZnO nanostructures. Hydrothermal growth occurs in the region where the seed layer forms, which is also where structural color is expressed [9 – 14]. Hydrothermal growth refers to the synthesis of nanostructures in water at 40 – 80  °C. Therefore, {{the shape of the}} pattern is defined by the region of the seed layer. To fabricate optical switching patterns, a nanofiber seed layer is required that is aligned in one direction. To accomplish this, we used electrospinning, which is the most commonly used method for fabricating nanofibers [15 – 18]. However, collected electrospun nanofibers are usually randomly aligned. Research has been conducted to align nanofibers to minimize the net torque of electrostatic forces applied to the fiber ends [19]. In this way, the nanofibers can be aligned in a <b>floating</b> <b>state</b> (the nanofibers are aligned in the air between the electrodes), and an aligned seed layer can be fabricated by transferring the fabricated nanofibers to the target substrate. In order to produce the wire pattern of microscale without using electrospinning, a complicated patterning process using photoresist must be performed, which is a process that is not only difficult to realize mass production and large-scale as well as increase the process cost.|$|E

The grounded ice boundary is 53, 610 km long; 74 % of it abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19 % is adjacent to open or sea&# 8208;ice covered ocean, and 7 % of the boundary are land terminations with bare rock. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models: two created from the input ICESat laser altimetry and Landsat data, two from stereo satellite imagery, and two from compilations of primarily radar altimetry. Elevation selection and an assignment of confidence in the elevation value are based on agreement with ICESat elevation values and shape of the surface inferred from the Landsat imagery.
