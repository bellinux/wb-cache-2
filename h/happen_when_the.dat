5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> popular media are unable to report on activities that the government {{may be trying to}} hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E

Kratzer predicts that the merging of DPs to a specifier position would only <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> DPs are without phi features. In the event that a DP adopts phi features from v from predication, then {{there should be a}} clear distinction.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to reach}} the ceiling, Michelangelo needed a support; the first idea was by Julius' favoured {{architect}} Donato Bramante, who wanted to build for him a scaffold to be suspended in the air with ropes. However, Bramante did not successfully complete the task, and the structure he built was flawed. He had perforated the vault in order to lower strings to secure the scaffold. Michelangelo laughed when he saw the structure, and believed it would leave holes in the ceiling once the work was ended. He asked Bramante what was to <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> painter reached the perforations, but the architect had no answer.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the practice of the}} Orthodox Church, a particular hero of faith can initially be canonized only at a local level within local churches and eparchies. Such rights belong to the ruling hierarch and it can only <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> blessing of the patriarch is received. The task of believers of the local eparchy is to record descriptions of miracles, to create the hagiography of a saint, to paint an icon, as well as to compose a liturgical text of a service where the saint is glorified. All of this is sent to the Synodal Commission for canonization which decides whether to canonize the local hero of faith or not. Then the patriarch gives his blessing and the local hierarch performs the act of canonization at the local level. However, the liturgical texts in honor of a saint are not published in all Church books but only in local publications. In the same way these saints are not yet glorified and venerated by the whole Church, only locally. When the glorification of a saint exceeds the limits of an eparchy, then the patriarch and Holy Synod decides about their canonization on the Church level. After receiving the Synod’s support and the patriarch’s blessing, the question of glorification of a particular saint on the scale of the entire Church is given for consideration to the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right now.

500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is {{a fantasy}} action-adventure game with {{role-playing}} and puzzle elements {{set in a}} large open-world environment. The player controls series protagonist Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional world. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called [...] "Z-targeting". In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows what will <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.|$|E

30|$|When sharing records, {{it is very}} {{important}} to avoid the disclosure of sensitive information of the individuals. There are three basic privacy disclosures that have been so far identified. They are identity disclosure, membership disclosure and also attribute disclosure. Identity disclosure <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> character is linked to a specific record inside the shared data set. Attribute disclosure <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> new approximate information about some man or woman is found out, which in turn indicates that the shared data render it feasible to be able to retrieve the individual’s characteristics with greater certainty than could be got earlier with the records shared. Membership disclosure <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> information disclosed is about whether the record of an individual exists in the data that is published or not.|$|R

[...] The Achilles' heel of this approach is the loss of eschatological tension between this present age and the future divine rule that is yet to come.
