After the third musical change, the video depicts objects on a pale background again. A book is shown being turned upside down, and the direction of the video changes from moving downwards to upwards. The stop-motion actions are shown being reversed, such as a stained-blue shirt losing its stain.

2500|$|Professor James Kugel of Bar Ilan University {{wrote that}} early interpreters {{saw in the}} {{juxtaposition}} {{of the law of}} tzitzit in [...] with the story of Korah's rebellion in [...] a subtle hint as to how Korah might have enlisted his followers. Forcing people to put a special blue tassel on their clothes, ancient interpreters suggested Korah must have argued, was an intolerable intrusion into their lives. Korah asked why, if someone's whole garment was already <b>dyed</b> <b>blue,</b> that person needed to add an extra blue thread to the corner tassel. But this question, ancient interpreters implied, was really a metaphorical version of Korah's complaint in [...] "Everyone in the congregation [...] is holy, and the Lord is in their midst. So why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?" [...] In other words, Korah asserted that all Levites were part of the same garment and all blue, and asked why Moses and Aaron thought that they were special just because they were the corner thread. In saying this, Kugel argued, Korah set a pattern for would-be revolutionaries thereafter to seek to bring down the ruling powers with the taunt: [...] "What makes you better than the rest of us?" [...] Kugel wrote that ancient interpreters thus taught that Korah was not really interested in changing the system, but merely in taking it over. Korah was thus a dangerous demagogue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of the volumetric flow rate and feed concentration was investigated for the adsorption of the reactive <b>dye</b> <b>Blue</b> 5 G. Experiments were carried out in a bed packed with retorted shale, at 30 &# 186;C. The ranges investigated were flow rate 2 - 10 mL/min and the feed concentration 13 - 105 mg/L. Mathematical models were used to represent the dynamic sorption. The double resistance model considers the effects of the axial dispersion and the mass transfer resistance of the external film and inside the particles. As a result, the mass transfer coefficient of the external film and the internal mass transfer coefficient were estimated. The Thomas model was used to simulate the experimental data. In this model the fitted parameter was the adsorption kinetic constant. The first model provided an acceptable representation of the dynamic uptake of the reactive <b>dye</b> <b>Blue</b> 5 G...|$|R

60|$|The man in {{the boat}} was of a good but not {{particularly}} fine physique, and possessed straight black hair, regular aquiline features, and an intelligent face. He {{was dressed in a}} brown cloth garment, something like a flannel shirt without the sleeves, and in an unmistakable kilt of the same material. The legs and feet were bare. Round the right arm and left leg he wore thick rings of yellow metal that I judged to be gold. The woman had a sweet face, wild and shy, with large eyes and curling brown hair. Her dress was made of the same material as the man's, and consisted, as we afterwards discovered, first of a linen under-garment that hung down to her knee, and then of a single long strip of cloth, about four feet wide by fifteen long, which was wound round the body in graceful folds and finally flung over the left shoulder so that the end, which was <b>dyed</b> <b>blue</b> or purple or some other colour, according to the social standing of the wearer, hung down in front, the right arm and breast being, however, left quite bare.

Methods 605 patients with early stage breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated in the study. Patients underwent sentinel node mapping using combined radiotracer and <b>blue</b> <b>dye</b> techniques. Lymphoscintiraphy was also performed for 590 patients. <b>Blue</b> <b>dye,</b> radioisotope, and overall success rates in identifying the sentinel lymph node were evaluated in different patient groups.
