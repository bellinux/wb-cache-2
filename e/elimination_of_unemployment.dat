40|$|Unemployment is {{and will}} be for the {{foreseeable}} future one of the major issues of economies in transition. Not only is unemployment in Post-communist economies a socially explosive problem, what happens on the unemployment front allows us to also make inferences {{about the state of the}} transition process in general. In this paper we look at Polish unemployment as it evolved from January 1990 to June 1991. A framework is developed which allows us to discuss flows into and out <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> In analyzing the determinants of the various flows we discuss the macroeconomic environment brought about by the reforms and the role of prices and wages. However, we above all, stress institutional and structural factors which have an impact on labour flows in the Polish Post-communist economy. The stocks of several variables are also analyzed. We relate the trends <b>of</b> some <b>unemployment</b> stocks (especially the stocks of school leavers and group layoffs) to the trend of the overall stock <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> We also look at the trends of vacancies and of various U/V ratios and touch upon the short run and long run trends of employment by sector. The main conclusion of the paper is that the high level <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in Poland is neither due to the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> hidden <b>unemployment</b> (it actually increased in 1990 !) nor a result of restructuring. The level <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> is high because of large inflows form outside the labour force and because of large inflows from outside the labour force and because hirings have been much smaller than in previous years while separation have only been slightly higher...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{interactions}} between labor market institutions and unemployment dynamics in transition economies. It presents a dynamic matching {{model in which}} state sector firms endogenously shed labor and private job creation takes time. Two main conclusions arises. First, higher unemployment benefits increase steady-state unemployment, and, during the transition, they reduce the fall in real wages and speed up closure of state enterprises. Second, higher minimum wages can theoretically speed up the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> state sector jobs without affecting steady-state unemployment. These results are broadly consistent with existing evidence on the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> and real wages in transition economies. ...|$|R

However, the emphasis of the Constitution is almost only in the wage employment. Therefore, the debate about the right to work has been restricted. Relevant groups of the population which are not engaged in wage employment sit on the sidelines of this debate.

40|$|Spośród 44 miast województwa łódzkiego 28 (tj. 63, 6 %) ośrodków należy do kategorii tzw. „małych miast”. Znaczna ich część wykazuje poważne problemy rozwoju społeczno-gospodarczego i cechuje się dużym udziałem obszarów zdegradowanych. Istotną szansę aktywacji małych miast stanowi proces rewitalizacji. Impulsem do jej realizacji stały się możliwości pozyskania funduszy unijnych. Ich wykorzystanie w tym kontekście uzależnione jest od opracowania lokalnych programów rewitalizacji (LPR). W artykule dokonano kompleksowej analizy porównawczej LPR dla sześciu odpowiednio dobranych miast z obszaru województwa łódzkiego pod kątem zasięgu ich oddziaływania, skali i rodzaju działań rewitalizacyjnych oraz systemu realizacji. Among 44 {{cities in}} the Łódź region 28 are {{included}} {{into the category of}} so called "small towns". Many of them show serious social and economic issues and they are characterized by a high proportion of degraded areas. Opportunity for development of small towns has been a process of revitalization. It includes a comprehensive, coordinated and long-term activities that lead to significant spatial, technical, social and economic changes. The possibilities of financing the projects with EU funds became the impetus for the revitalization processes in Poland. Their use is dependent on the development of local revitalization programs (LPR). In this article the comparative analysis of revitalization program for six small towns {{in the area of the}} Łódź region was implemented, taking into account three categories of cities in terms of population. From the group of small towns from 10 to 20 thousand population a survey was conducted for Konstantynów Łódzki and Koluszki, from a group of 5 to 10 thousand for residents of Działoszyn and Poddębice, and from the group of towns below 5 thousand residents for Złoczew and Krośniewice. The analysis concerned the spatial extent of areas revitalized, financial scale and type of actions and their implementation system. In the smallest towns, revitalized surface area is relatively small, but its share in the total municipal area is larger than in the other cities. The most often repeated delimitation criteria are following: the level of land and public facilities degradation, poor housing facilities, the degradation level of the technical infrastructure, social issues and their weak economic activation. Larger towns more often used social criteria (unemployment, crime), however the smaller ones were likely to use weak economic growth criterion. Revitalization activities clearly dominate in the spatial field (improvement of housing conditions, renovation of public buildings, protection of monuments, modernization of technical infrastructure). Less frequently, activities in the sphere of economic activation (investment promotion, tourism development functions) and the elimination of social problems (<b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment,</b> increased security, living conditions improvement) have been undertaken...|$|E
