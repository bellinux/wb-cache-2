40|$|Recognition of membrane-anchored glycosphingolipid receptors {{by various}} ligands {{is the key}} event in several {{biological}} phenomena. However, mere presence of these cell-surface receptors does not always ensure their recognition and binding by their respective ligands, a phenomenon termed "crypticity". Earlier {{studies have suggested that}} different glycan headgroup, orientations exposing and/or masking different epitopes may explain the crypticity of glycolipids. The effect of lipid environment on the orientation and conformation of GM 1 ganglioside has been investigated in the present study by MD simulation technique in an attempt to understand the structural basis of crypticity. In addition, the effect of the length of the ceramide <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tails</b> on the headgroup conformation has also been investigated. MD simulations for 1 ns were performed with explicit water molecules for both GM 1 headgroup (GM 1 -Os) and GM 1 embedded in dodecylphosphocholine micelle. The simulations show that the conformations of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tails,</b> ceramide-saccharide linkages, and the headgroup are inter-related and are affected by micellar packing considerations. The conformations of GalNAc-beta 1 [...] > 4 -Gal and Neu 5 Ac-alpha 2 [...] > 3 -Gal linkages were found to be restricted when GM I is embedded in the micelle compared to that in GM 1 -Os. The GalNAc-beta 1 [...] > 4 -Gal linkage being a branch point, affects the orientation/accessibility of all the residues linked to GalNAc. If such a disallowed glycan conformation is necessary for recognition by, and binding to, their ligands, then the glycans may become cryptic. The ceramide with 8 -carbon <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tails</b> was found to adopt a "surface-bound" configuration. In contrast, ceramide with 12 - or 16 -carbon tails was found to adopt "micelle-inserted" configuration. The effect of lipid environment was found to be the least on the oligosaccharide linked to the ceramide with hexadecyl tails. Thus, the headgroup conformation in this case is essentially {{the same as that of}} the free headgroup. This probably explains the lesser crypticity of glycolipids with longer <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tails...</b>|$|R

Also for high OMMT content, the gel and aerogel preparation procedures occur without re-aggregation of the exfoliated clay, which is instead observed for other kinds of polymer processing. Aerogels with the exfoliated OMMT have more even dispersion of the clay layers, higher elastic modulus and larger surface area than aerogels with the intercalated OMMT.

50|$|The {{presence}} of cholesterol in the membrane {{of the target}} cell is required for CDC pore formation. The arrangement of cholesterol molecules in the bilayer may also be important for successful binding. The non-polar <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> of cholesterol orients itself toward the polar center of the membrane lipid bilayer, while the 3-β-OH group is oriented closer to the ester bonds formed by the fatty acid chains, and glycerol backbones closer to the membrane surface. Even with the 3-β-OH group near the membrane surface, it is not very exposed compared to the phospholipid head groups. The availability of cholesterol at the membrane surface is dependent upon its interaction with other membrane components such as phospholipids and proteins; and the more cholesterol interacts with these components the less available it is to interact with extramembranous molecules. Some factors that affect cholesterols availability are size of the polar head groups {{and the ability of}} the phospholipid to hydrogen bond with the 3-β-OH group of cholesterol. Cholesterol associates with phospholipids, forming a stoichiometric complex and contributes to membrane fluidity. If cholesterol concentration exceeds a certain point, free cholesterol will begin to precipitate out of the membrane. The binding and pore formation of CDC will occur when the concentration of cholesterol exceeds the association capacity of the phospholipids, allowing the excess cholesterol to associate with the toxin.|$|E
40|$|Nonionic alcohol ethoxylates {{are widely}} used as {{surfactants}} in many different applications. They are available in {{a large number of}} structural varieties as technical grade products. This variety is mainly based on the use of different alcohols, which can be linear or branched and contain primary, secondary, or tertiary OH groups. Technical grade products are poorly defined as they are composed of alcohol mixtures being different in chain length and structure. On the other hand, monodisperse alcohol ethoxylates are commercially available; however, these surfactants exist only with primary and linear alcohols. In the field of microemulsion research the monodisperse alcohol ethoxylates {{are widely used}}. The phase behavior and film properties of these surfactants were studied intensively with respect {{to the size of the}} hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Due to the lack of appropriate model surfactants until now, there is little information on how the structure of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> influences the microemulsion behavior. To examine structural influences, we synthesized a series of surfactants with the composition C 10 E 5 and having different linear and branched hydrocarbon tails. The surfactants were monodisperse with respect to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> but polydisperse with respect to the ethoxylation degree. However, a detailed characterization showed that they were similar concerning the average ethoxylation degree and EO chain length distribution. The phase behavior was investigated for bicontinuous microemulsions, and the film properties were analyzed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Our results show that the structure of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> strongly influences the microemulsion behavior. The most efficient surfactant is obtained if the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> is linear and the hydrophilic group is attached in the C- 1 position. Surfactants having the hydrophilic group bound to the C- 2 or C- 4 position or which contain a branched <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> are less efficient and exhibit in most cases visibly lower phase inversion temperatures. Both the efficiency and temperature behavior mainly can be explained on the basis of increased bulkiness of the branched structures compared to the fully linear version. The phase behavior results are largely confirmed by the SANS investigations. Those results show that the fully linear surfactant exhibits the most rigid interfacial film. In additional experiments this surfactant was compared with its monodisperse analogue. According to the phase diagrams, the surfactant having the polydisperse hydrophilic moiety is drastically more efficient although the film stiffnesses are almost identical...|$|E

For a variety of compositions, results are reported for binary systems within temperature and pressure ranges of 260 – 310 K and 2. 0 – 10 MPa respectively. In each experiment the surfactants reach equilibrium with carbon dioxide at different concentrations. The data show that with all the surfactants upon increasing concentration, the liquid–liquid curve shifts to lower temperatures.

When {{the length of the}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>tail</b> remains constant and the ethoxylated chain is increased from three to five groups, the LL curve once again shifts to lower temperatures and the two phases start earlier.
