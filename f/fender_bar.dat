40|$|Field {{measurements}} of header losses while harvesting different grain crops, mainly wheat and barley, were performed in Sweden during the harvesting season in 1986. In addition, divider losses in rapeseed were studied on one occasion. Different settings, e. g. reel speed index, reel height, stubble height and forward speed were varied. The header losses were collected manually, cleaned and weighed. The moisture content was measured {{to make it}} possible to convert the sample weights to 15 % moisture content (in rapeseed to 18 % water content). At each setting the header losses from a total of 7. 5 m 2 were collected. This area was divided into 15 plots, each of 0. 5 m 2. Sometimes also header losses from the divider area were collected. In rapeseed, the losses were collected in chutes placed in the gap between the crop rows. Nine chutes were placed in three adjacent gaps, three chutes in each. Each chute measured 10 cm x 100 cm. The gap between the rows measured about 25 cm. The header losses were divided into loose kernels and parts of or whole ears. In the experiments performed in seed crops most of the collected losses were ears. The header losses, apart from divider losses, were seldom of any magnitude. In most cases they were less than 50 kg/ha. However, in some cases they exceeded 200 kg/ha. Losses in the divider area were mostly of a more considerable size. In an upright standing crop, divider losses generally were between 150 and 300 kg/ha. In a lodged crop they were more than 1000 kg/ha in some cases. In general, divider losses were about 20 to 40 % of the total header losses. In a lodged crop they could make up more than 60 % of the total header losses. The experiments were unable to reveal whether the header losses, except for the divider losses, were constant along the cutterbar width. Neither could it be established whether there were any differences between different header constructions. Header losses increased rapidly in winter barley with increasing stubble height. This depends on the more or less broken straw that characterizes barley. Only a few experiments were made with different forward speeds. Header losses were generally larger at low speeds (about 0. 5 m/s) than at normal speeds (about 1 m/s). Quite a few experiments were performed with different reel speed indexes. In general, least losses occurred at reel speed indexes between 1. 2 and 1. 6. In some experiments with different reel heights, the largest header losses occurred when the reel was positioned as low as possible. Least header losses occurred when the lowest position of the reel bats were level or slightly below the ears. One experiment with different divider equipment was performed in rapeseed. Divider equipment using a <b>fender</b> <b>bar</b> was not suitable in rapeseed. when this divider was mounted, the divider losses considerably exceeded those of the torpedo divider and vertical cutterbar. No particular difference occurred between the torpedo divider and the vertical cutterbar. With the vertical cutterbar mounted, losses tended to decrease with increasing forward speed...|$|E

50|$|The 1960 Series 62 had smoother, more {{restrained}} styling. General changes {{included a}} full-width grille, {{the elimination of}} pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint {{in the application of}} chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. Series 62 models were distinguished by plain fender skirts, thin three-quarter length bodyside spears and Cadillac crests and lettering on short horizontal front <b>fender</b> <b>bars</b> mounted just behind the headlights. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. The convertible model had power windows and a two-way power seat. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Fawn, Blue or Gray Cortina Cord or Turquoise, Green, Persian Sand, or Black Caspian cloth with Florentine vinyl bolsters. Convertibles were upholstered in Florentine leather single or two-tone combinations or monochromatic Cardiff leather combinations.|$|R
50|$|Fords for 1941 {{were much}} more modern with a wide body that nearly covered the running boards. The front and rear fenders were still pronounced, but were now {{integrated}} more into {{the body and the}} headlights were pushed all the way up and out over the front wheels. The 1941 grille was a three-part affair with a tall center section bookended by twin kidneys low on the <b>fenders</b> and vertical <b>bars</b> all around. The 1941 was a bigger car with a 194.3-in (4.935-m) overall length. Body styles included two-door and four-door sedans, a sedan coupe, a business coupe, and convertible coupe, sedan delivery wagon, and woody station wagon. The pickup truck continued with the 1940 standard Ford styling.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the market}} {{segments}} expanded as manufacturers offered {{a wide variety}} of pick-up truck types and sizes. With the dawn of the extended cab, trucks began taking on a more urban appeal and were being purchased for their style as well as their utility. This new audience of truck owner began to demand more than a simple tool box to adorn their trucks. They began developing an appetite for accessories that would complement the look of their truck and manufacturers began to accommodate their desires with products like billet grilles, chrome <b>fender</b> trim, nerf <b>bars</b> and hood deflectors. In addition, truck manufacturers began collaborating with and designing their vehicles to easily accommodate these accessories with bolt-on ease.|$|R

Sheet metal forming is a widely used and costly manufacturing process, to which these considerations apply. Aluminum sheet becomes favorable compare to steel regards to some improvement at aerodynamic designs, increased engine efficiency and fuel economy. Wide range of aluminum automotive product included doors, <b>fenders,</b> bumpers face <b>bars,</b> seat frames and roof panels have been produced. This paper was carried out to study the finite element (elastic-plastic) analysis of sheet metal forming process using the finite element software. LUSAS simulation was carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of sheet forming process. Axisymmetry element mesh and plain strain element mesh were use incorporated with slideline features to model and study the sheet metal forming process. Simulation of elasticplastic behavior of aluminum sheet was carried out under non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal forming process...|$|R
5000|$|The 1932 Series 355B {{was even}} longer and lower, with an entirely restyled front assembly. The roof line was lowered 1 - 3 in. The longer hood now had six hood ports. The new front end styling {{included}} a flat grille {{built into the}} radiator shell, head and side lights of streamlined bullet shape {{and the elimination of}} the <b>fender</b> tie <b>bar</b> and monogram bar. The trumpets of the dual horns projected through the headlight stanchions. The headlight lenses were 9.5 in in diameter. The dual taillights matched the headlights. Super safe lighting featured three filament bulbs and four contour positions for degree and angle of illumination. The front license plate was mounted on the bumper. Runningboards curved to match the sweep of the front fenders and blended into the rear fenders. The tail of the rear fenders blended into the fuel tank valence. The trunk on the town sedan, town coupe and five-passenger convertible coupe was integral with the body. The vision of the driver was improved by 30 percent {{as a result of the}} elimination of the outside visor and the construction of a 12 degree sloping windshield and corner posts. There was a large ventilator on top of the cowl and none on the sides. All separate body moldings were eliminated. A three spoke steering wheel enabled an unobstructed view of the instrument cluster when in the straight ahead position. The right side of the instrument panel was occupied by a [...] "locker." [...] Engine horsepower increased to 115. The deepening Great Depression helped sales plummet to 2,700.|$|R
50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The <b>fender</b> tie <b>bar,</b> after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|R
