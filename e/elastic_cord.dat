500|$|In 2012, Ohio State University {{professor}} Hugh Urban {{asserted that}} Hubbard had adopted {{many of his}} theories from the early to mid 20th century astral projection pioneer Sylvan Muldoon stating that Hubbard's description of exteriorizing the thetan is extremely similar if not identical to the descriptions of astral projection in occult literature popularized by Muldoon's widely read [...] Phenomena of Astral Projection (1951) (co-written with Hereward Carrington) [...] and that Muldoon's description of the astral body as being connected to the physical body by a long thin, <b>elastic</b> <b>cord</b> is virtually {{identical to the one}} described in Hubbard's [...] "Excalibur" [...] vision.|$|E
500|$|Cyathus is a genus of {{fungi in}} the Nidulariaceae, a family collectively {{known as the}} bird's nest fungi. They are given this name since they {{resemble}} tiny bird's nests filled with [...] "eggs", structures large enough to have been mistaken {{in the past for}} seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The [...] "eggs", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an <b>elastic</b> <b>cord</b> of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as [...] or [...] ); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species.|$|E
500|$|The {{immature}} fruiting body of Crucibulum laeve (technically, the peridium), {{is roughly}} spherical in shape, but in maturity {{the base is}} narrowed slightly relative to the top, so that it appears like a cup, or crucible. The fruiting bodies are usually 5–8mm tall and almost as wide at the mouth. When young, the mouth is enclosed by a thin membrane called an epiphragm, which is covered with surface hairs. As the fruiting body matures and the fruiting body expands, the epiphragm ruptures, exposing the internal contents. The wall of the fruiting body is made of a single uniform layer of closely interwoven hyphae (the threadlike filaments that form the mycelium) roughly 0.25–0.5mm thick; this wall structure {{is in contrast to}} species from the bird's nest fungus genus Cyathus, which have a distinctly three-layered wall. Young species have a yellowish velvety cover of fine hairs, but this external surface becomes sloughed off and becomes smooth as the fruiting body matures; the color changes to brown, although some old weathered specimens may be bleached grey or dirty white. The inner surface of the fruiting body is smooth and shiny. The cups contain tiny pale ochraceous or white [...] "eggs," [...] technically termed peridioles, usually 1–2mm in diameter. In each peridiole is a spore-producing layer of tissue, the hymenium. This layer is largely composed of basidia (spore-producing cells) mixed with paraphyses (non-spore producing elements interspersed between basidia). Peridioles are covered by a thin membrane of loosely woven hyphae known as a tunica; separated from the light-colored tunica, the peridioles are black. The peridioles are attached to the inner wall of the peridium by a thin, <b>elastic</b> <b>cord</b> of mycelium, a funiculus, which can be extended at length when moist.|$|E

2500|$|... often {{abbreviated}} SD, is a {{brand of}} ball-jointed doll, or BJD, made by the Japanese company Volks. They are made {{to be easy to}} customize and are primarily marketed to adult doll collectors and customizers. They are cast in polyurethane resin, a porcelain-like, hard, dense plastic. The most common standard models are about 60cm, or 24inches, tall, taller and heavier than most comparable Western dolls. They are designed in a style which is both realistic and influenced by anime, and most models are anatomically correct. The various body parts have ball joints for articulation, and are strung together with a thick <b>elastic</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} {{noted for its}} minimalist set, where LaLanne {{inspired}} his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience [...] "with the enthusiasm of an evangelist," [...] to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos. In 1959, LaLanne recorded Glamour Stretcher Time, a workout album which provided phonograph-based instruction for exercising with an <b>elastic</b> <b>cord</b> called the Glamour Stretcher. [...] As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers. [...] Wife Elaine LaLanne {{was part of the}} show to demonstrate the exercises, as well as the fact that doing them would not ruin their figures or musculature. [...] LaLanne also included his dog Happy as a way to attract children to the show. [...] Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming [...] "Walter" [...] stood for [...] "We All Love To Exercise Regularly." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{keeping with}} the minimalist philosophy, {{buoyancy}} compensators should be only as large as is necessary to provide neutral buoyancy {{at any point in}} the dive, and should allow easy, confident and reliable dumping. The volume should not exceed about 65 lb for twin cylinders or 30 lb for single cylinders, on the premise that needing more would be evidence that the rig is unbalanced and unsafe, as the diver should be able to drop excess weight and swim up without a functioning buoyancy compensator. An unnecessarily large bladder volume is considered dangerous as it can contribute to a runaway ascent. Wings with the expansion constrained by <b>elastic</b> <b>cords</b> are also deprecated as they can trap air pockets, making it difficult to get all the air out.|$|R

40|$|Reflex {{responses}} {{that depend on}} human otolith organ sensitivity were measured before, during and after a 10 day space flight. Otolith-spinal reflexes were elicited by means of sudden, unexpected falls. In weightlessness, "falls" were achieved using <b>elastic</b> <b>cords</b> running from a torso harness to the floor. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus. The EMG response occurring in the first 100 - 120 ms of a fall, considered to be predominantly otolith-spinal in origin, decreased in amplitude immediately upon entering weightlessness, and continued to decline throughout the flight, especially {{during the first two}} mission days. The response returned to normal before the first post-flight testing session. The results suggest that information coming from the otolith organs is gradually ignored by the nervous system during prolonged space flight, although the possibility that otolith-spinal reflexes are decreased independent of other otolith output pathways cannot be ruled out...|$|R
