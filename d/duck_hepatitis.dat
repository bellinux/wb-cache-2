40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey of duck production {{was carried out}} in 2002 on 771 traditional, semiscavenging household duck farms on the coastal Island of Hatia. We determined the socioeconomic characteristics of duck farmers and their management systems, identified the factors associated with egg production, and measured the level of selected duck diseases and current preventive strategies. Household family size varied from 1 to 14 individuals and women were the main caretakers of ducks. Around 34 % of keepers were illiterate. Most duck products (eggs and meat; 85 %) were sold at the local market. Duck houses were poorly ventilated and a variety of bedding materials were used. Feed was available in nearby scavenging areas; however, additional feed was frequently supplied by farmers. Almost all farmers (96 %) ranked the rainy season as the best time for rearing ducks due to greater feed availability. The annual egg production was 79 eggs per layer with a weight of 48 g and a hatchability rate of 87 %. Egg production varied by zone (p[*] 22 weeks (p< 0. 001). Most farmers ranked duck plague as the most important disease, followed by duck cholera, botulism, and <b>duck</b> viral <b>hepatitis.</b> Preventive vaccination was sporadic and used by few farmers (28 %).

40|$|Because {{polysaccharide}} and flavone ingredients display good antiviral activity, {{we developed}} a flavone/polysaccharide-containing prescription that would be effective against <b>duck</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> (DVH) and investigated its hepatoprotective effects. Flavones were derived from Hypericum japonicum (HJF) (entire herb of Hypericum japonicum Thunb) and Salvia plebeia (SPF) (entire herb of Salvia plebeia R. Br.), and polysaccharides were derived from Radix Rehmanniae Recens (RRRP) (dried root of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch). This prescription combination {{was based on the}} theory of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese veterinary medicine. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted using the three single ingredients compared to the combined HRS prescription to determine their anti-duck hepatitis A viral (anti-DHAV) activity. The results showed that all experimental conditions displayed anti-DHAV activity, but the HRS prescription presented the best effect. To further investigate the hepatoprotective effect of the HRS prescription on DHAV-induced hepatic injury, we tested the mortality rate, the hepatic pathological severity score, plasma biochemical indexes of hepatic function, blood DHAV gene expression levels and peroxidation damage evaluation indexes and then analyzed correlations among these indexes. The results demonstrated that the HRS prescription significantly decreased the mortality rate, reduced the severity of hepatic injury, decreased the hepatic pathological severity score, depressed blood DHAV gene expression levels, and returned the indexes of hepatic function and peroxidation almost to a normal level. These results indicate that the HRS prescription confers an outstanding hepatoprotective effect, and we expect that it will be developed into a new candidate anti-DHAV drug...|$|R
40|$|Hepadnavirus {{replication}} {{requires the}} concerted {{action of the}} polymerase and core proteins to ensure packaging of the RNA pregenome and DNA maturation. The arginine-rich C terminus of the core protein plays {{an essential role in}} both of these steps while being dispensable for nucleocapsid formation. In an attempt to identify other functional domains of the core protein, we performed a series of trans-complementation experiments analyzing the ability of <b>duck</b> and human <b>hepatitis</b> B virus (DHBV and HBV) core protein subunits to support the replication of a core-defective DHBV genome. Plasmids expressing the N-terminal amino acids 1 to 67 or the remaining C-terminal portion, amino acids 67 to 262, of the DHBV core protein were cotransfected into LMH cells along with a replication-deficient construct coding for the DHBV pregenome and polymerase. Neither the N nor the C terminus alone yielded replication-competent core particles. However, cotransfection of plasmids that separately expressed both regions restored a normal replication pattern. Furthermore, the DHBV C terminus but not the N terminus could be replaced by the corresponding domain of the HBV core protein in this assay. Finally, coexpression of the complete HBV core protein and the N terminus from DHBV resulted in DHBV replication, while the HBV core protein alone was not functional. Taken together, these findings suggest a modular organization of the DHBV core protein in which the C terminus is functionally conserved among different hepadnaviruses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Hepatitis B {{virus is}} a major human {{pathogen}} which has been extensively studied, yet its structure is unknown. Cryo-electron microscopy of the viral cores expressed in Escherichia coli or isolated from infected liver provides a means for determining {{the structure of the}} hepatitis B nucleocapsid. Results Using cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction, we have determined the structures of <b>duck</b> and human <b>hepatitis</b> B virus cores and find that they have similar dimer-clustered T= 3 and T= 4 icosahedral organizations. The duck virus core protein sequence differs from the human in both length and amino acid content; however, the only significant structural differences observed are the lobes of density on the lateral edges of the projecting (distal) domain of the core protein dimer. The different cores contain varying amounts of nucleic acid, but exhibit similar contacts between the core protein and the nucleic acid. Immuno-electron microscopy of intact cores has localized two epitopes on the core surface corresponding to residues 76 – 84 and 129 – 132. Conclusion The bacterial expression system faithfully reproduces the native hepatitis B virus core structure {{even in the absence of}} the complete viral genome. This confirms that proper assembly of the core is independent of genome packaging. Difference imaging and antibody binding map three sequence positions in the structure: the C terminus and the regions near amino acids 80 and 130. Finally, we suggest that the genome–core interactions and the base (proximal) domain of the core dimer are evolutionarily conserved whereas the projecting domain, which interacts with the envelope proteins, is more variable...|$|R

40|$|Primarily {{resulting}} as a spin-off of {{the search}} for effective anti-HSV or anti-HIV agents, several compounds have been identified as effective and promising candidate anti-HBV drugs, i. e. famciclovir (penciclovir), BMS- 200475, lamivudine (3 TC), (-) FTC, L(-) Fd 4 C, L-FMAU, DAPD (DXG), bis(POM) -PMEA and bis(POC) -PMPA. They all inhibit HBV replication in Hep G 2 2. 2. 15 at concentrations that are well below the cytotoxicity threshold. All these nucleoside analogues require three phosphorylation steps to be active, in their triphosphate form, as inhibitors of the HBV DNA polymerase, except for PMEA (adefovir) and PMPA (tenofovir), which need only two phosphorylation steps, to PMEApp and PMPApp, respectively, to interact as chain terminators with the HBV DNA polymerase reaction. Several of these compounds (for example, famciclovir, lamivudine and adefovir) have proven to be efficacious in the <b>duck</b> and/or woodchuck <b>hepatitis</b> models, and, accordingly, famciclovir, lamivudine and adefovir have also proven to be effective (i. e. in reducing HBV DNA levels) in patients with chronic HBV infection. Yet, famciclovir and lamivudine may lead to the emergence of resistance mutations (i. e. L 528 M and M 552 V/I) in the HBV DNA polymerase upon long-term treatment. These penciclovir- and lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants still retain susceptibility to adefovir, which, in turn, has so far not been found to engender resistance mutations in HBV. As has become obvious from the experience with the treatment of HIV infections, future HBV chemotherapy may reside in combination drug therapy so as to achieve the highest possible virus reduction, thereby minimizing the likelihood of drug resistance development. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|A {{completely}} distinct enzyme {{has also}} been named carboxypeptidase D (EC number 3.4.17.22). This second enzyme is a metallocarboxypeptidase (i.e. uses a zinc ion in the active site instead of a serine residue) and is broadly expressed in mammalian tissues. Like the serine carboxypeptidase, the metallocarboxypeptidase D also removes C-terminal arginine or lysine residues from peptides, with an optimal pH range of 5 to 7. Metallocarboxypeptidase D {{is located in the}} trans Golgi network where it contributes to the biosynthesis of neuropeptides and peptide hormones (such as insulin) along with carboxypeptidase E. In addition to this role, metallocarboxypeptidase D contributes to the processing of proteins, following the action of furin (an endoprotease located in the trans Golgi network). The duck ortholog of metallocarboxypeptidase D was named gp180 and is a receptor for uptake of <b>duck</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B virus. In fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), carboxypeptidase D is known as the silver mutation, with defects causing altered wing shape. Metallocarboxypeptidase D is generally a membrane-bound protein, although in some organisms a soluble form is generated by either differential RNA splicing or by proteolytic activity.
