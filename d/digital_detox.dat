50|$|CCFC {{changed the}} name of TV-Turnoff to Screen-Free Week in 2010, since {{entertainment}} media (and advertising) are increasingly delivered {{through a variety of}} screens (computers, hand-held devices, etc.), and not just traditional television commercials.

Some people have moral, ethical or political reasons to refrain from technology usage, such as fear of violation of their privacy.

50|$|Stress {{and work}} {{overload}} create social isolation, resulting {{in less time}} to recreate and socialize and leading to an over-reliance on technology for social engagement. These drivers have led to new ways of searching for well-being and quality of life. The concept of wellness has changed the way people travel and the way hotels, airlines, airports, cruise lines, and destinations create products, deliver services, and promote their brand. Among the top wellness tourism trends are healthy hotels, <b>digital</b> <b>detox,</b> in flight wellness, food tourism, {{and the rise of}} wellness travel agents.|$|E
5000|$|The Internet, {{established}} in 1995 in Mongolia, {{has yet to}} make a significant impact, with only 16% of the population having access to it as of 2012. Mongolia is the most sparsely populated independent country in the world, which is a serious constraint to country-wide Internet deployment. While much of the country remains pastoral with countryside residents dependent on herding and agriculture, Internet access is widely available to urban populations. There has been steady online growth in online newspapers, magazines and advertising.The poor access to the Internet in the countryside has been a reason behind designating Mongolian countryside as a <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> location for the tech-tired tourists.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>detox</b> {{refers to}} {{a period of time}} during which a person refrains from using {{electronic}} connecting devices such as smartphones and computers. It is regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress, focus more on true social interaction and connection with nature in the physical world. Claimed benefits include increased mindfulness, lowered anxiety, and an overall better appreciation of one's environment. The best way to detox is by going into nature. [...] Studies have shown that blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension and the level of “stress hormones” like Cortisol all decrease faster in natural settings. Depression, anger and aggressiveness are reduced in green environments and ADHD symptoms in children reduce when they play in green settings.|$|E

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>detox</b> {{technologies}} such as smartphones, tablets, and PDAs, have grown and developed at an extraordinary rate to become {{an essential part of}} everyday life. While ICT is a driving force in the contemporary tourism industry, some travel agencies and hotels have recently detected a niche market for those people who want to ‘escape’ from the digital life by offering ‘digital detox travel packages’, i. e. travel to remote areas that are highly disconnected of ICTs. While the current literature has investigated the tourists’ experience of a forced disconnection, it has yet not sufficiently investigated what the rationales are for the tourists choosing to undertake a <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> holiday. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate and understand the motives of tourists to undertake a <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> holiday. To get an understanding of the motives to undertake a <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> holiday, in-depth interviews among Dutch tourists have been conducted. The results of the study show that especially sociological, psychological and physic health factors motivated tourists to undertake a <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> holiday. ...|$|E
40|$|Invention of Internet and {{usage of}} smart phones and tablets has changed our life style in last 15 years. Some {{applications}} are life saving tools for smart phone addicted consumers. According to a survey, {{at the end}} of 2015 mobile Internet users will take over desktop Internet users. Smart phones are an inseparable part of our life. People on holiday want a stress free period during their journey. We all desire a wonderful holiday as a gift to ourselves. Why do people go on holiday? Businessman and women go on holiday as a break from their normal duties due to the health consequences posed with failure to break. On the other hand, families and other individuals go on holidays for reasons such as relaxation and adventures among others. Since we use smart devices often, we take them with us on holiday and often use them as a communication, entertainment tool during our holiday. What happens if we do not use our smart devices during our holiday? Can we survive or not? <b>Digital</b> <b>detox</b> holiday provides a chance to decrease stress and focus on social interaction in the real world. Some hotels realized that they may offer digital free environment for the guests and this may attract some customers to the <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> hotels. On the other hand, acceptance of this idea for a community will not be easy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss a new travel trend that nearly rejects the digital life during a holiday and focus on individual needs rather than virtual environment.

40|$|The idea of "going on {{a digital}} detox" arrives as a {{response}} to a proliferation of digital technology and a concern that this addictive form of sociality erodes meaningful or authentic connection. This paper explores concerns about our relationship with digital technology through a short ethnography of Camp Grounded: a Californian <b>digital</b> <b>detox</b> retreat and summer camp for adults. At Camp Grounded, digital detoxers conceptualise consumption of technology using a food parallel. While the brief connection or "snack" of a text message might temporarily satisfy, detoxers feel that waiting for a more nutritious face-to-face encounter will ultimately be more emotionally nourishing. This paper interrogates the food/technology metaphor to unpack its analytical limitations and the questions it prompts about the future of our relationship with digital technology...|$|E
