40|$|Product {{development}} {{organizations are}} facing more pressure {{now than ever}} before to become sustainable. However, organizations are reluctant to compromise product functionality {{in order to create}} products that have less environmental impact than that required by regulations. Thus, engineers may face a conflict between improving product functionality and reducing environmental impact. The design for environment (DfE) tools currently available are inadequate with respect to helping engineers determine how to resolve this conflict during the conceptual design phase. The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) which is based on Design by Analogy provides a promising conceptual design approach for this problem. Examples of products that simultaneously reduce environmental impact and improve product functionality can inspire engineers to do likewise. This research consists of 1.) Finding products and patents that overcome a contradiction between product functionality and environmental impact; 2.)

40|$|Cheap fossil oil {{resources}} are becoming depleted and {{crude oil prices}} are rising. In this context, alternatives to fossil fuel-derived carbon are examined {{in an effort to}} improve the security of carbon resources through the development of novel technologies for the production of chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable feedstocks such as biomass. The general concept unifying the conversion processes for raw biomass is that of the biorefinery, which integrates biofuels with a selection of pivot points towards value-added chemical end products via so-called "platform chemicals". While the concept of biorefining is not new, now more than ever there is the motivation to investigate its true potential for the production of carbon-based products. A variety of renewable chemicals have been proposed by many research groups, many of them being categorized as drop-ins, while others are novel chemicals with the potential to displace petrochemicals across several markets. To be competitive with petrochemicals, carbohydrate-derived products should have advantageous chemical properties that can be profitably exploited, and/or their production should offer cost-effective benefits. The production of drop-ins will likely proceed in short term since the markets are familiar, while the commercial introduction of novel chemicals takes longer and demands more technological and marketing effort. Rather than describing elaborate catalytic routes and giving exhaustive lists of reactions, a large part of this review is devoted to creating a guideline for the selection of the most promising (platform) chemicals derived via chemical-catalytic reaction routes from lignocellulosic biomass. The major rationale behind our recommendations is a maximum conservation of functionality, alongside a high atom economy. Nature provides us with complex molecules like cellulose and hemicellulose, and {{it should be possible to}} transform them into chemical products while maintaining aspects of their original structure, rather than taking them completely apart only to put them back together again in a different order, or turning them into metabolites and CO 2. Thus, rather than merely pursuing energy content as in the case of biofuels, the chemist sees atom efficiency, functional versatility, and reactivity as the key criteria for the successful valorization of biomass into chemicals. To guide the choice of renewable chemicals and their production, this review adopts the original van Krevelen plots and develops alternative diagrams by introducing a <b>functionality</b> <b>parameter</b> F and a functionality index F:C (rather than O:C). This index is more powerful than the O index to describe the importance of functional groups. Such plots are ideal to assess the effect of several reaction types on the overall functionality in biomass conversion. The atom economy is an additional arbitrator in the evaluation of the reaction types. The assessment is illustrated in detail for the case of carbohydrate resources, and about 25 chemicals, including drop-ins as well as novel chemicals, are selected. Most of these chemicals would be difficult to synthesize from petrochemicals feeds, and this highlights the unique potential of carbohydrates as feedstocks, but, importantly, the products should have a strong applied dimension in existing or rising markets. Ultimately, the production scales of those markets must be harmonized to the biomass availability and its collection and storage logistics. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between starch structure and functionality {{are important in}} underpinning the industrial and nutritional utilisation of starches. In this work, the {{relationships between}} the biosynthesis, structure, molecular organisation and functionality have been examined using a series of defined genotypes in barley with low (50 %) amylose starches. A range of techniques have been employed to determine starch physical features, higher order structure and functionality. The two genetic mechanisms for generating high amylose contents (down-regulation of branching enzymes and starch synthases, respectively) yielded starches with very different amylopectin structures but similar gelatinisation and viscosity properties driven by reduced granular order and increased amylose content. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to elucidate the relationships between genotypes and starch molecular structure and <b>functionality.</b> <b>Parameters</b> associated with granule order (PC 1) accounted for {{a large percentage of the}} variance (57 %) and were closely related to amylose content.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the impact of}} strain and channel {{thickness}} {{on the performance of}} biaxial strained silicon MOSFET with 40 nm channel length has been analyzed by simulation in TCAD Sentaurus Simulator. With the increase in the mole fraction of germanium at the interface of the channel region, the strain in the silicon channel increases and with it the mobility of the carriers increases and thus the drain current increases. The mole fraction in this paper is varied from 0 to 0. 3. Other than mobility, the increase in strain also shows improvement in other performance parameters. The impact of variation in channel thickness on the <b>functionality</b> <b>parameters</b> of the MOSFET has also been analyzed. The channel thickness cannot be increased more than the critical thickness and therefore, in this paper the thickness is varied from 2 nm to 20 nm.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of the development of}} modern technology depends, to a great extent, on the possibilities of producing the innovative materials with high <b>functionality</b> <b>parameters,</b> which could be used in modern, highly advanced technological processes. Surface engineering plays a very important role in this area. This is mainly due to the fact that, for many structural materials, the possibilities of classical formation of their properties (e. g., by heat treatment or the selection of the microstructure, chemical and phase composition) have been practically used up. The material and technological achievements in the surface engineering area allow the modification of the properties of the surface layer of tool and machine components. As a result, they may be better suited to work in increasingly difficult and more demanding conditions. The hybrid technologies, combining several different methods of surface treatment in one complex technological process, are the most advanced solutions compared to already known surface engineering methods. In the article, the authors present the possibilities of shaping the functional properties of the surface layer. The authors describe problems associated with the development of the hybrid technology and provide the examples of physical modelling, design, technological development, and the practical application of a hybrid technology.

A long term field test was conducted to determine which design parameters of a customized insole embodies the highest benefit for the athlete perceived performance. A test assembly of 20 athletes evaluated a traditional and a customized insole under three different sport conditions 1) indoor sports, 2) outdoor sports, and 3) running). A questionnaire was designed that asked for nine functions at six decisive foot segments (heel, metatarsal, forefoot; lateral, medial); 1) optimal roll off, 2) cushioning, 3) force transmission, 4) feet support, 5) bedding, 6) secure step, 7) avoid slipping 8) avoid pressure and 9) avoid pain. These items were subjectively evaluated by our test persons and finally correlated with initially collected objective measures. Static and dynamic plantar pressure measurements provided data for individual foot sole profiles. Results showed four important outcomes. Firstly, different sports applications require different functional insoles to ensure optimal athlete perception and performance. Secondly the grade of customization increases their perceived performance. Thirdly objective and subjective data are both required to ensure optimal insole supply. And fourthly subjects are rather limited in their ability to distinguish effects of insole design modifications.

Objective: This study investigated the effect of two weeks interval training on blood biochemistry and immunological parameters in rats with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sedentary (SE, n = 10), diabetic sedentary (DI, n = 10), diabetic interval training (DIT, n = 10). IV injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg) induced diabetes. Interval training consisted of swimming exercise for 30 seconds with 30 seconds of rest for 30 minutes {{three times a week}} during two weeks, with an overload of 15 % of the total body mass. The evaluations performed were fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations, phagocytic capacity, cationic vesicles content, superoxide anion, and production of hydrogen peroxide of blood neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages. Results: The results showed that two weeks interval training did not attenuate the hyperglycemic state at rest and did not decrease blood lipids in the DIT group. Diabetes increased the functionality of blood neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages in the DI group. Interval training increased the content of cationic vesicles and the phagocytic capacity of blood neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages in the DIT group.

40|$|Symptoms {{of water}} stress {{are the most}} {{frequent}} cause for the “end of vase life” in prior stored roses. It was hypothesized that dark storage may alter the stomatal functionality and may cause water balance problems during the subsequent vase life period. The effect of short- and long-term storage on functionality of stomatal and subsequent flower performance was investigated in two rose cultivars (cvs) (‘Akito’ and ‘Grand Prix’) with presumed different sensitivity for development of water stress symptoms during the vase life. Compared to no storage, both short term storage (2. 3 d at 6 °C) and long term storage (28 d at 0. 5 °C) negatively affected the stomatal functionality in cultivar (cv) Akito. Stomatal <b>functionality</b> <b>parameters</b> such as the rapidity of the closing response upon dehydration and the relative water content at which stomata are fully closed showed good correlations with flower performance parameters (flower weight changes and vase life). This indicates that in cv Akito, the decreased stomatal functionality {{is one of the}} factors involved in the poor vase life of prior stored flowers. In cv Grand Prix, however, storage did not greatly affect the stomatal functionality but storage negatively affected flower performance in a comparable way as in cv Akito. A pre-treatment with abscisic acid prior to storage slightly improved stomatal functionality in both cvs, but no clear effect on flower performance was observed. Addition of the bactericide 8 -HQC to the vase water improved flower performance in both cvs but could not alleviate the negative effect of cold storage on flower performance. Results show that in roses cold storage may, depending on the cultivar, negatively affect stomatal functionality and this may contribute to water stress and ultimately flower failure.
