There exists massive number of spams sent from justifiable home computers that comprises of a malware called as bot. The current scheme to <b>identify</b> <b>mail</b> senders called as Domain Keys <b>Identified</b> <b>Mail</b> (DKIM) which cannot identify such spamming bots. They are capable of only identifying email domains and not email addresses of the senders. A delicately complex problem when using no DNS is where to locate our trusted core, rather than the DNS. To cope up with this problem, we are proposing a design to detect the email addresses of senders that do not use DNS, so we embed our scheme into the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

50|$|DKIM is {{a method}} of {{labeling}} a message, {{and it does not}} itself filter or identify spam. However, widespread use of DKIM can prevent spammers from forging the source address of their messages, a technique they commonly employ today. If spammers are forced to show a correct source domain, other filtering techniques can work more effectively. In particular, the source domain can feed into a reputation system to better identify spam. Conversely, DKIM can make it easier to <b>identify</b> <b>mail</b> that is known not to be spam and need not be filtered. If a receiving system has a whitelist of known good sending domains, either locally maintained or from third party certifiers, it can skip the filtering on signed mail from those domains, and perhaps filter the remaining mail more aggressively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ Domain Keys <b>Identified</b> <b>Mail</b> (DKIM) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{mechanisms}} by which email messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain to claim responsibility for the release of an email into the mail stream. As the volume of emails exchanged becomes large, the software implementations of DKIM using OpenSSL library will become a limiting factor of performance due to the heavy computations involved. In this largely empirical work, we identify the computation intensive modules of DKIM and solve the performance issues by implementing their functions on COTS hardware. Our approach makes use of the Intel Embedded processor Tolapai (Intel EP 80579) that has several built-in cryptographic functionalities, viz. security accelerators for bulk encryption, authentication, hashing and public/private key generation and digital signing. Experimental results show that an overall 50 % acceleration can be achieved by transparently migrating the DKIM functionalities to hardware...|$|R

Erasure codes introduce pollution attack, an attack in which the adversary injects packets to disrupt the erasure decoding procedure and consequently denies the authentication service to the receiver. This paper uses the agent for checking the spam E-Mail by using DKIM and proposes a new lightweight, pollution-attack resistant multicast authentication scheme (PARM), which generates evidence that receiver agent can validate on a fast, per-packet basis. Using agent, {{the authenticity of the}} system will increase and also our system will be more secure. Because of using the temporal key, time will be saved for generating evidence to the same message. by incorporating sender evidence in the E-Mail messages thereby making Spam Weeding possible.

50|$|Because vanity domains are {{operated}} for or {{on behalf}} of individuals, they typically will not offer the full complement of services an organisational domain name (or rather, the host that it points to) {{would be expected to}} honour; for example, the DNS record may contain only an MX record <b>identifying</b> a <b>mail</b> server accepting e-mail for that domain (which may itself be an e-mail forwarding server) and an A record identifying a shared web hosting service only offering HTTP (which may itself be a URL redirection service).|$|R

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the methods and objectives of high school graduate/former student follow-up activities to identify procedures that resulted in high response rates and helpful information. Information was obtained from three sources: local school systems in the Richmond metropolitan area, selected school systems in other areas of Virginia, and school systems in other states as identified through a search of the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) database. The purposes of the follow-up activities continue to center on determining post-secondary efforts and employment status; however, studies developed to obtain baseline data and to measure strategic plan objectives were also found. Although traditional mail surveys remain prevalent, innovative approaches involving focus groups and telephone response surveys were <b>identified.</b> <b>Mail</b> surveys that included a telephone interview component achieved highest response rates.
