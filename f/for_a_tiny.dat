5|$|In 1922, Holden {{designed}} the War Memorial Gateway for Clifton College, Bristol, {{using a combination}} of limestone and gritstone to match the Gothic style of the school's buildings. For the British War Memorials Committee, he produced a design for a Hall of Remembrance (1918) that {{would have been in the}} form of an art gallery, and for New College, Oxford, he created a design <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> memorial chapel (1919). Neither was constructed.|$|E
25|$|There exist both continuous-wave and pulsed OPOs. The {{latter are}} easier to build, since the high {{intensity}} lasts only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of a second, which damages the nonlinear optical material and the mirrors less than a continuous high intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the ichneumonids is still poorly known. The family is highly diverse, containing 24,000 described species. Approximately 60,000 species {{are estimated to}} exist worldwide, though some estimates place this number at over 100,000. Due to the high diversity, the existence of numerous small and hard to identify species, {{and the majority of}} species being undiscovered, it has proven difficult to resolve the phylogeny of the ichneumonids. Even the relationships between subfamilies are unclear. The sheer diversity also means DNA sequence data is only available <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of the species, and detailed cladistic studies require major computing capacity.|$|E
50|$|<b>For</b> such <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> {{ecosystem}} it has {{an extraordinarily}} rich biodiversity, having roughly {{the same number of}} plant species as {{can be found in the}} whole of the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Kaduk is {{also known}} <b>for</b> Kaduk's chapel, <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> tower between the barracks and the main camp of Auschwitz.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor of}} Wilhelm is relatively level, with a rougher {{area to the}} northeast. The remainder is flat and almost featureless except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets.|$|R
500|$|Adler writes vividly {{and with}} humor. He {{describes}} the director Hartenstein as [...] "a {{young man from}} Galicia with long hair and short brains, half educated in Vienna, and half an actor", and refers to the poor of Whitechapel as looking as if they [...] "had {{come out of their}} mothers already gray and old." [...] Of his early London years, he writes, [...] "We played <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> audience, on a stage the size of a cadaver, but we played well, with a drunkenness of happiness." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{observers}} {{found the}} practice humorous. Luke Meredith, {{a writer for}} the Associated Press, wrote that it [...] "has already led to a few amusing moments where a coach, enraged with a call gone against his wrestler, had to reach <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> stuffed animal and fling it across the mat to get the referee's attention." [...] NBC Sports commentators for their Olympic coverage began referring to Vinicius as [...] "the challenge mascot." [...] Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website Thrillist, wrote that the mascot took [...] "a little of the anger out of a challenge." [...] Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on [...] "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, particularly if it has cultural significance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Maliconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, [...] "The fate of one of my athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error. And I have a stuffed animal in my hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemp Muhl and Lennon premiered {{the band}} The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger during a live {{performance}} at Radio City on Valentine's Day, 2008. The duo, {{commonly referred to}} as 'The GOASTT', released their debut single, [...] "Jardin Du Luxembourg", on July 6, 2010, and their debut album, [...] "Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger (Acoustic Sessions)," [...] on October 26, 2010, both on Chimera, their own label. In conjunction with the debut, they performed six songs during an hour-long interview on WNYC and four songs <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Tiny</b> Desk Concert on NPR.|$|E

50|$|Sports {{cars have}} {{traditionally}} accounted <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> percentage of car sales throughout Europe, but the European Car of the Year accolade was won by one for 1978, when the Porsche 928 sealed the award {{in the face}} of competition from the BMW 7 Series and Ford Granada.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> {{many centuries}} <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> church {{was the only}} {{building}} on the Island. The remains of the church were demolished when St Catherine's Fort was constructed in 1867. It served as <b>a</b> zoo <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of years.|$|R
2500|$|Even a [...] "closed bolt" [...] weapon needed {{reliable}} ammunition. If the cap in a cartridge {{is faulty}} {{to the extent}} of delaying the firing of the gun <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of a second (quite a common case in practice with mass-produced ammunition) this is of little consequence {{in the case of a}} gun in use by infantry on the ground – but in the case of a synchronized [...] "aircraft" [...] gun such a delay can well produce a rogue firing, sufficiently [...] "out of time" [...] for it to risk hitting the propeller.|$|E
2500|$|San Antonio {{serves as}} the seat of BexarCounty. Recent annexations have {{extended}} the city's boundaries into Medina County and, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> area {{near the city of}} Garden Ridge, into Comal County. Since San Antonio was founded during the Spanish Colonial Era, it has a church (San Fernando Cathedral) in its center, located on the main civic plaza in front, a characteristic which is found in some other Spanish-founded cities, towns, and villages in Spain and Latin America. Due to its placement, the city is similar to other Western urban centers, in which areas outside the city limits are sparsely populated and have low density.|$|E
2500|$|From 1895, {{there is}} no {{question}} about first-class status because of the official definition. The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, although there has been hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947. Status of limited overs matches, which began in 1963, is governed by the official List A categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major Twenty 20 matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> percentage of the total number of matches recorded. Apart from one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930–31, all the [...] "disputed" [...] matches took place in England before 1895: see Variations in published cricket statistics for further information.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner walls}} of the crater slope down to a {{relatively}} level interior floor. This bottom floor is nearly featureless except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets scattered across the surface. In the southeast, the ejecta from Nearch A has produced a slightly more irregular region.|$|R
50|$|Industrial {{activities}} are responsible <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> portion of Comoran economic activity—about 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Principal industries {{are those that}} involve processing cash crops for export: preparing vanilla and distilling ylang-ylang into perfume essence. These activities were once controlled almost entirely by French companies, but as they closed unprofitable plantations, individual farmers set up many small, inefficient distilleries.|$|R
50|$|In {{the hamlet}} itself Petworth Road, a road east from Haslemere forms a {{junction}} with Killinghurst Lane that leads towards Chiddingfold, {{where all the}} cottages are yet there are a remarkable line of four listed buildings <b>for</b> such <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> settlement further along Petworth Road near the border with West Sussex are Benham's Stud Farm and its Barn, Huntingfords and Cherry Tree Cottage.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the bronze}} medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team {{for the third}} time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that [...] "We lost to them once already, we couldn't let that happen again. The final had to be ours", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that [...] "We didn't have any choice, we {{absolutely}} had to win at any cost". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying [...] "Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania. Forget about your personal ambitions. People are watching you, losing sleep over you". Šarūnas Marčiulionis: [...] "Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer. Marčiulionis played 40 minutes during that match and scored 29 points, while Sabonis added 27. Donnie Nelson described the locker room as [...] "like winning the NBA championship times five". After the bronze medal victory, de jure Head of State Vytautas Landsbergis visited the team at the locker room, and they all sung the national anthem.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans invaded Belgium at {{the start}} of the war and held the entire country (except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> sliver) for the entire war. [...] They left Belgium {{stripped}} and barren. [...] Over a 1.4 million refugees fled to France or to neutral Netherlands. [...] Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents. [...] After the systematic atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. There was never an armed resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of refusal to work for the benefit of Germany. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians [...] "turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation," [...] according to Kossmann. [...] In 1916 Germany deported 120,000 men and boys to work in Germany; this set off a storm of protest from neutral countries and they were returned. Germany then stripped the factories of all useful machinery, and used the rest as scrap iron for its steel mills.|$|E
2500|$|In {{much the}} same way as they had taken up the Tojeiro {{prototype}} and turned it into the Ace, AC acquired the rights and at the 1973 London Motor Show showed their own version, the mid-engined ME3000 with the 3.0-litre Ford Essex V6 engine installed transversely over a bespoke AC-designed gearbox. Development was virtually complete in 1976 when new Type Approval regulations were introduced. A prototype failed the [...] crash test, and the chassis had to be redesigned. On the second attempt, the car passed with flying colours. This was a huge achievement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> firm—Vauxhall had to make several attempts before the contemporary Chevette passed. For AC, such delays meant that the first production cars (now renamed 3000ME) were not delivered until 1979, by which time they were in direct competition with the Lotus Esprit. Although comfortable, brisk, nicely built and practical, AC's ambitions of selling 250 cars per year were a distant memory. After just 71 cars were sold, Hurlock called a halt to production as his health was suffering and the company was struggling in the teeth of a recession. In 1984, production stopped at Thames Ditton and the car and the AC name were licensed to a new company registered as AC (Scotland) plc run by David McDonald in a new factory in Hillington, Glasgow. Here, 30 cars were built, including a development car tested with Alfa Romeo's 2.5-litre V6 engine and a nearly complete Mark 2 prototype of the same. Regardless (or possibly because) of these developments, AC Scotland called in the receivers in 1985.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} the interior floor is not notably marked by impacts except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets. The interior surface is more level and featureless {{compared to the}} rugged terrain that surrounds the crater. Near {{the midpoint of the}} floor is a low, rounded central ridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of this crater has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving the floor flat, shallow, and nearly featureless. There is no central peak at the midpoint, and little {{to mark the}} interior except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets. The outer rim remains circular and only slightly worn.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, he {{appeared}} on a $1 U.S. Postage stamp, {{as part of the}} Great Americans Series. U.S. engraver Kenneth Kipperman, who designed the stamp, was suspended <b>for</b> including <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> Star of David, invisible to the naked eye, in Revel's beard.http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-15/news/mn-256_1_tiny-star Kipperman was later arrested by District of Columbia police and charged with threatening to blow up the site of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|R
60|$|The waiter appeared. Gerald {{glanced at}} the glasses of the other two. Birkin was {{drinking}} something green, Miss Darrington had a small liqueur glass that was empty save <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> drop.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better stop {{singing and}} help me," [...] {{she said to}} Mr. Wren sharply. Mr. Wren obediently stopped singing and began to hunt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> little twig such as Jenny had taken into that hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] a voice replied; {{and then}} the sound of oars in the water told that the boat was leaving the harbor, {{probably}} steering <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> red light which could now be seen some distance off the land.|$|E
60|$|As I came {{round the}} jutting {{promontory}} of the hill's shoulder I saw that which quickened my pulses and set {{my heart to}} beating high, <b>for</b> within <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> basin between the crest of this hill and the next stood four people before {{the mouth of a}} great cave, and beside them upon the gleaming snow rested a flier which had evidently but just been dragged from its hiding place.|$|R
50|$|This is a worn crater with an eroded rim. The {{southern}} part of the rim in particular is disrupted and irregular in form, with a pair of small craters along the inner wall. The remainder of the rim is roughly circular. The interior floor is relatively featureless, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets.|$|R
50|$|The rim of Liebig {{has a low}} inner wall, with an {{interior}} floor that is nearly featureless except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>tiny</b> craterlets. It is nearly, but not quite circular, with outward bulges {{to the west and}} southeast. The small, cup-shaped crater Liebig A lies along the inner wall and part of the interior floor.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not like}} it. Nor did he like it when the man-animals arose and went on with their march; <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> man-animal took {{the other end of}} the stick and led Kiche captive behind him, and behind Kiche {{followed}} White Fang, greatly perturbed and worried by this new adventure he had entered upon.|$|E
60|$|Now {{they were}} almost {{opposite}} the aperture and between the giant cliffs that rose {{on either side of}} the narrow entrance a sight was revealed that filled their hearts with renewed hope and rejoicing, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> cove was seen to lie beyond the fissure--a cove with a long, wide, sandy beach up which the waves, broken at the entrance to the little haven, rolled with much diminished violence.|$|E
60|$|I {{have learned}} {{one of the}} prime virtues of a steel sailing-ship. Such a craft, heavily laden, does not strain her seams open in bad weather and big seas. Except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> leak down in the fore-peak, with which we sailed from Baltimore and which is bailed out with a pail once in several weeks, the Elsinore is bone-dry. Mr. Pike tells me that had a wooden ship of her size and cargo gone through the {{buffeting}} we have endured, she would be leaking like a sieve.|$|E
25|$|After Cammaerts and {{the other}} two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was {{subsequently}} murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> portion of its value.|$|R
60|$|At {{once the}} little girl {{realized}} what had happened. Their wicked enemy Zog had by his magic art frozen all the water in their room while they slept, {{and now they were}} all imprisoned and helpless. Trot and Cap'n Bill were sure to freeze to death in <b>a</b> short time, <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> air space remained between their bodies and the ice, and this air was like that of a winter day when the thermometer is below zero.|$|R
40|$|Recent fits of cosmological {{parameters}} by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) measurement favor a primordial scalar spectrum {{with varying}} index. This result, if stands, could severely constrain inflation model buildings. Most extant slow-roll inflation models allow <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> amount of scale {{variations in the}} spectrum. We propose in this letter an extra-dimensional inflation model which is natural theoretically and can generate the required variations of the spectral index as implied by the WMAP for suitable choices of parameters...|$|R
