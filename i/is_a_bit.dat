5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|M1 is flat-crowned. The anteroloph, a crest at {{the front}} of the tooth, lacks a smaller {{accessory}} spur that is present in N.rufus. The paracone, one of the main cusps, is quite small; this cusp is more prominent in N.rufus. The mesoloph, a crest on the middle of the tooth, is distinct but short and located further to the back than in N.rufus. M2 has a longer mesoloph. M3 is largely flat-crowned, but the paracone <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more prominent than the rest. The valley between the cusps {{at the front}} is deeper than the valleys at the back. Each of the upper molars has three roots.|$|E

5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in lampreys, and hagfish, the cerebellum is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellum <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the cerebellum by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{died while}} {{archbishop}} on 12 February 941. During {{his time as}} archbishop, he received as gifts two gospels that are still extant, as Wulfhelm donated them to Christ Church. One of the gospels was produced in Ireland, the other either in Lotharingia or Germany. The second gospel may originally have been a gift to Æthelstan during the negotiations over the marriage of Æthelstan's sister Edith to the future Emperor Otto I. These diplomatic events probably explain the appearance of Wulfhelm's name in the confraternity books of some German monasteries. He may also have given land to the church, although the record <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unclear as to exactly what was given. Another grant of land was of land at Deverel, Wiltshire to Glastonbury Abbey while he was archbishop.|$|E

5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age, therefore she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops {{many times over the}} course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E

An anachronistic style, if you like. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of R&B, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> 1940s, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> Tex-Mex. <b>As</b> a writer, I think he deserves more credit than he gets for being intelligent.
