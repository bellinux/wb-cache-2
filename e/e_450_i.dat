Cultures of freshly isolated hepatocytes prepared from untreated male rats and samples of the intact donor liver contained readily detectable quantities of immunoreactive P- 450 h protein (measured on immunoblots of cell microsomes) and P- 450 h mRNA (measured on Northern blots of cellular RNA). Neither P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> immunoreactive protein nor P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> mRNA were present. Addition of physiologic concentrations of human or bovine growth hormone, but not of prolactin, to culture medium lacking insulin or other hormones resulted in prompt induction of P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> immunoreactive protein and P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> mRNA. Induction of P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> mRNA in male hepatocyte cultures was dependent on the concentration of growth hormone, required as little as 24 hr of exposure, and was markedly attenuated in cultures maintained on type I collagen rather than on matrigel. Growth hormone treatment also induced the level of mRNA for insulin-like growth factor I, whereas the amount of mRNA for the male-specific urinary protein alpha 2 mu-globulin was unaffected. Cultures of hepatocytes derived from untreated adult female rats retained high levels of P- <b>450</b> <b>i</b> mRNA {{but only if the}} culture medium contained growth hormone. None of the tested treatments with estrogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, or growth hormone induced P- 450 h mRNA or P- 450 h immunoreactive protein in cultures of female hepatocytes. We conclude that the somatogenic effects of growth hormone acting alone and directly on the hepatocyte in culture are sufficient to "feminize" the cytochrome P- 450 phenotype.

The results show a clear fatigue endurance “trough” in LOC LBE, while no such a strong temperature dependence of the fatigue endurance is observed when the steel is tested in vacuum. The fractographic observations by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that ductile microdimples are prevalent on the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum, whereas the fracture surfaces produced in LOC LBE at all the temperatures are characterized by quasi-cleavage. Interestingly, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), martensitic laths close to the fatigue crack walls or to the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum are found to have transformed into very fine equiaxed subgrains.

It has been previously reported that purified R 393 A, F 438 A, and W 501 A HCV helicase proteins do not unwind RNA but unwind DNA, bind RNA, and hydrolyze ATP. On the other hand, previous data suggest that a W 501 F protein retains most of its unwinding abilities and that purified T <b>450</b> <b>I</b> and <b>E</b> 493 K HCV helicase proteins have enhanced unwinding abilities. In a hepatoma cell line that has been cured of HCV replicons using interferon, the T <b>450</b> <b>I</b> and W 501 F replicons synthesized both negative-sense and positive-sense viral RNA and formed colonies after selection with similar efficiencies as the parent replicon. However, the Δhel, R 393 A, F 438 A, and W 501 A replicons encoded and processed an HCV polyprotein but did not synthesize additional viral RNA or form colonies. Surprisingly the same phenotype was seen for the E 493 K replicon. The inability of the E 493 K replicon to replicate might point to a role of pH in viral replication because a previous analysis has shown that, unlike the wild-type NS 3 protein, the helicase activity of an E 493 K protein is not sensitive to pH changes.

40|$|International audienceThe nitroderivatives of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are potentially important photosensitisers in the atmospheric condensed phase. Here we show that the triplet state of 1 -nitronaphthalene (31 NN*) is able to directly react with phenol, causing its transformation upon irradiation of 1 NN in aqueous solution. Additional but less important processes of phenol degradation are reactions with OH and 1 O 2, both photogenerated by irradiated 1 NN. Dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were detected as main phenol transformation intermediates, likely formed by dimerisation of phenoxy radicals that would be produced upon phenol oxidation by 31 NN*. Very interestingly, irradiation with 1 NN shifted the fluorescence peaks of phenol (Ex/Em ¼ 220 e 230 / 280 e 320 nm and 250 e 275 / 280 e 320 nm, with Ex/ Em ¼ excitation and emission wavelengths) to a region that overlaps with "M-like" fulvic substances (Ex/ Em ¼ 250 e 300 / 330 e 400 nm).

Cell transplantation of human and mouse cells into immune compromised mice has greatly enhanced our understanding of stem cell function, regeneration, and cancer.

By contrast, large-scale cell transplantation of fluorescent blood and cancer cells into syngeneic and irradiated zebrafish has now become routine 1 – 7. However, these approaches require that donor cells are from the same strain of syngeneic zebrafish or that the recipient immune system is transiently ablated by whole body γ-irradiation two-days prior to transplantation. Irradiated recipients eventually recover their immune system by 20 days post-irradiation and kill engrafted cells 1, 2, 6, making long-term engraftment studies difficult.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influences on productive and physiologic attributes during Marandu palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha) establishment, following changes in phosphorus availability in the soil through the applications of phosphate and silicate. To achieve this, a fractionated factorial 5 ² design was used, with 13 combinations for silicon and phosphorus, respectively, in mg dm- 3 : 150 and 10; 150 and 170; 150 and 330; 225 and 90; 225 and 250; 300 and 10; 300 and 170; 300 and 330; 375 and 90; 375 and 250; 450 and 10; 450 and 170 and 450 and 330, distributed according to randomized blocks, with four replications. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using samples of a Typic Haplustox (760 g kg- 1 sand, 40 g kg- 1 silt and 200 g kg- 1 clay). Wollastonite was used as the source of silicate and the sources of phosphorus were Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2, KH 2 PO 4 and NaH 2 PO 4. Marandu palisadegrass was grown during the summer and two harvests were made during the growing season. Significant interaction between phosphorus and silicate rates was found for the number of tillers and expanded green leaves, total leaf area, dry mass production of leaf laminae and culms with sheaths, and dry mass production of plant tops. Maximum responses of the analyzed variables were reached in the combination of the intermediate rates of phosphorus (170 and 250 mg dm- 3) with high rates of silicon (375 and 450 mg dm- 3).

Four different sites in urban environments (Florence, Italy) and two volcanic areas characterized by intense degassing of H 2 S-rich fluids (Campi Flegrei and Vulcano Island, Italy) were selected for such measurements. The concentrations of H 2 S generally varied over 5 orders of magnitude (from 10 − 1 – 103  μg/m 3), the H 2 S values measured with the Radiello® traps (H 2 SR) being {{significantly higher than the}} average values measured by the Thermo® <b>450</b> <b>i</b> during the trap exposure (H 2 STa), especially when H 2 S was < 30  μg/m 3.

Amiata (Tuscany, Italy), revealing that the precision of the H 2 SR values was ± 49 %. This large uncertainty, whose cause was not recognizable, is to be added to that related to the environmental conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity, temperature), which are known to strongly affect passive measurements. The Thermo® <b>450</b> <b>i</b> analyzer measurements highlighted the occurrence of short-term temporal variations of the H 2 S concentrations, with peak values (up to 5732  μg/m 3) potentially harmful to the human health. The Radiello® traps were not able to detect such temporal variability due to their large exposure time. The disagreement between the H 2 SR and H 2 STa values poses severe concerns for the selection of an appropriate methodological approach aimed to provide an accurate measurement of this highly toxic air pollutant in compliance with the WHO air quality guidelines. Although passive samplers may offer the opportunity to carry out low-cost preliminary surveys, the use of the high-frequency H 2 S analyzer is preferred when an accurate assessment of air quality is required.

The recommendations are not published in this report, for more information Fazer Food Services can be contacted. Food additives which have already been approved are regarded as safe according to the safety evaluation methods available at the time of approval. However, consumption of them may not be a hundred percent risk free. Phosphates are allowed to be used in order to increase water holding capacity of meat products. This may lead to consumers feeling they have been cheated since water then can be added to the product, increasing the weight of it. Choosing for example KRAV or organic products is one way of avoiding food additives that may be uncertain when it comes to risk assessments. Such organizations (but not EU organic) also prohibit the use of the phosphates <b>E</b> <b>450</b> -E 452 and nitrite and nitrate E 249 -E 252. No connection between meat content and content of phosphates <b>E</b> <b>450</b> -E 452 in the products in this study could be found. The content of phosphate could possibly be linked to type of meat product. Sausages, smoked meat products, bacon, kabab products and pre-cooked pork and beef often seemed to contain phosphates while minced meat did not. The study also showed that if the goal is to keep the numbers of additives down, the price paid for some of the products may be increased. From this study, it was also found that similar effects as those achieved from food additives may be achieved using other methods such as deep freezing or sugar in high concentrations, which can be used for conservation...|$|R

The protein solution was then centrifuged at 14, 000  rpm for 10  min in a microcentrifuge and the spectrum of the FAD liberated from the protein was measured. The concentration of free FAD released from the protein was calculated using a molar absorptivity of free FAD (<b>Ɛ</b> <b>450</b> [*]=[*] 11, 300  M− 1  cm− 1). The molar absorption coefficient of ACMO was calculated to be Ɛ 443 [*]=[*] 12, 200  M− 1  cm− 1 after correcting for the dilution of the protein.|$|R

Formation of Mn 3 O 4 and ZnO phases was identified by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies after the initial discharge-charge cycle, which indicates that the ZnMn 2 O 4 phase was converted to a nanocomposite of Mn 3 O 4 and ZnO phases immediately after the electrochemical conversion reaction. close 687...|$|R
40|$|Sparse LU {{factorization}} with partial pivoting {{is important}} for many scientific applications and delivering high performance for this problem is difficult on distributed memory machines. Our previous work has developed an approach called S that incorporates static symbolic factorization, supernode partitioning and graph scheduling. This paper studies the properties of elimination forests and uses them to guide supernode partitioning/amalgamation and execution scheduling. The new design with 2 D mapping effectively identifies dense structures without introducing too many zeros in the BLAS computation and exploits asynchronous parallelism with low buffer space cost. The implementation of this code, called S +, uses supernodal matrix multiplication which retains the BLAS- 3 level efficiency and avoids unnecessary arithmetic operations. The experiments show that S + improves our previous code substantially and can achieve up to 11. 04 GFLOPS on 128 Cray T 3 <b>E</b> <b>450</b> MHz nodes, which i [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Within the hepatic acinus, the {{functional}} unit of liver parenchyma, the induction of cytochrome P- 450 protein by phenobarbital is manifested primarily in hepatocytes located {{closer to the}} hepatic venule, i. e., distal hepatocytes. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the levels of cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> mRNAs in populations of hepatocytes originating in the proximal or distal half of the liver acinus in the rat, as an approach to the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous zonal expression of cytochrome P- 450 protein. The development of a new method to isolate hepatocytes originating from the proximal or distal half of the liver acinus enabled the measurement of total cytochrome P- 450 content and of cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> mRNAs in these hepatocytes. Levels of cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> mRNAs were assessed in proximal and distal hepatocytes by Northern blot hybridization of poly(A+) RNA with a cDNA recognizing sequences of these two cytochromes. The kinetics of induction were defined by measuring these parameters after a single phenobarbital injection. Cytochrome P- 450 mRNA levels reached maximum induction at 16 hr, returning to basal values by 48 hr. In contrast, total cytochrome P- 450 microsomal protein content reached maximum induction after 33 hr. Hepatocytes of the distal half of the hepatic acinus responded to phenobarbital with higher levels of cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> mRNAs than proximal hepatocytes. These results indicated that there is modulation of the expression of the cytochromes P- 450 b and P- <b>450</b> <b>e</b> genes within the hepatic acinus...|$|R
40|$|How do we estimate, from {{thermodynamic}} measurements, {{the number}} of water molecules adsorbed or released from biomolecules {{as a result of}} a biochemical process such as binding and allosteric effects? Volumetric and osmotic stress analyses are established methods for estimating water numbers; however, these techniques often yield conflicting results. In contrast, Kirkwood-Buff theory offers a novel way to calculate excess hydration number from volumetric data, provides a quantitative condition to gauge the accuracy of osmotic stress analysis, and clarifies the relationship between osmotic and volumetric analyses. I have applied Kirkwood-Buff theory to calculate water numbers for two processes: (i) the allosteric transition of hemoglobin and (h) the binding of camphor to cytochrome P <b>450.</b> <b>I</b> show that osmotic stress analysis may overestimate hydration number changes for these processes...|$|R
40|$|Daily {{treatment}} of adult cynomolgus monkeys with <b>450</b> <b>i.</b> u. hCG for 16 days {{resulted in a}} significant 163 % {{increase in the number}} of Leydig cells, and a 9 -fold rise in plasma testosterone concentrations. The number of proliferating Leydig cells was very low, even after 16 days of treatment with hCG. Daily FSH administration (2 injections of 15 i. u. per day) did not have any effect on the number of Leydig cells or plasma testosterone values. It can be concluded, therefore, that in adult cynomolgus monkeys daily hCG treatment results in an {{increase in the number of}} Leydig cells, which is mainly caused by the differentiation of precursor cells. Since plasma testosterone concentrations were increased to an even higher extent, the steroid production per Leydig cell was also stimulate...|$|R
40|$|The timing {{mechanism}} for synchronous mass release of mature medusae of Halocordyle disticha was studied, using colonies from Shirahama, Wakayama, Japan, which {{were kept in}} a <b>450</b> <b>I</b> aquarium tank. In near natural conditions medusa release is correlated with sudden drop of light intensity such as occurs around sunset. Timing could be manipulated by controlling light intensity. Artificial sunset 2 hours earlier than normal caused mass release of medusae earlier than under natural conditions, whereas sunset artificially delayed 3 hours later than normal caused continuous release of medusa after the onset of darkness. The spawning of gametes of H. disticha is almost simultaneous with medusa release, and since the medusa has an ephemeral planktonic existence, synchrony of mass medusa release and also spawning of gametes may maximize fertilization success...|$|R
