In this work, the separation of glycine and ammonium chloride was performed with chromatographic column, deionized water used as <b>eluent</b> <b>solution,</b> and {{results showed that the}} separation efficiency was quite high. In this paper, our purpose is focused on the study of the mass transfer kinetics and equilibrium of the separation of glycine and ammonium chloride, in order to apply this technology to an industrial scale for separation of glycine from salts by SMB chromatography. In this study, based on the equilibrium-dispersive model of chromatography, overall mass transfer coefficients together with the axial dispersion coefficients were experimentally determined by moment analysis. Meanwhile, some parameters obtained were used to simulate the elution profiles, and simulation and experimental results were compared.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} attempted {{to develop the}} ceramic adsorbent media in order to remove uranium from crude phosphoric acid (aqueous phase). The adsorption capacity of the studied commercial ceramic sample was determined (about 11 mgU/g ceramic). The relevant factors affecting uranium adsorption on ceramic adsorbent were studied.

Also, the equilibrium adsorption isotherms for uranium adsorption on the studied ceramic sample were determined. Uranium removal from crude phosphoric acid by the ceramic adsorbent was studied using columnar technique.

The development of new PET-tracers is however far from trivial and the radiochemistry is a major limiting factor. Nucleophilic substitution reactions with [18 F]fluoride generally suffer from inconsistent labeling yields. There {{is a need to}} investigate the generic impurities causing such inconsistency in order to build more robust syntheses that also are in line with regulatory demands for approval of new PET radiopharmaceuticals. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how pharmaceutical-chemical impurities from a typical synthesis setup may influence labeling yields in nucleophilic substitution reactions with [18 F]fluoride. Following areas were studied: Borosilicate glassware, Kryptofix based eluent solutions, anion-exchange cartridges, and irradiated [18 O]water. Materials and methods The new commercial synthesizer, GE FASTlab™, was used as an investigational platform using three different benchmark reactions: [18 F]FACBC, [18 F]FDG and [18 F]Flutemetamol. The importance of identified impurities was investigated with radiochemical yield as the measured response. Eluent solutions of K 222, K 2 CO 3 in aqueous acetonitrile extracted ppm levels of silicon, boron and aluminum if stored in borosilicate glass at room temperature (days). It was revealed that relevant levels of aluminum present in the <b>eluent</b> <b>solution</b> (0. 4 – 2 ppm) could pass a polymer-based anion-exchange cartridge and cause detrimental effects on the RCY.

40|$|Mixtures of {{closely related}} mono- and disaccharides may be {{efficiently}} separated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) only when relatively dilute alkaline eluents are employed (i. e., < 20 mM NaOH). The main drawbacks of these <b>eluent</b> <b>solutions</b> are (i) column regeneration between runs, (ii) poor reproducibility of the retention times, and (iii) {{the need for}} post-column base addition for enhancing sensitivity. Here, we describe some examples of isocratic separations of carbohydrates by HPAEC coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) accomplished by carbonate-free alkaline eluents (i. e., 5 - 20 mM NaOH) obtained upon addition of Ba(OAc) 2 (1 - 2 mM). These separations include aldohexoses (i. e., galactose, glucose, and mannose), aminohexoses (i. e., glucosamine and galactosamine) and their N-acylated derivatives (i. e., N-acetylglucosamine and Nacetylgalactosamine) along with some isomeric disaccharides (i. e., lactose, lactulose and epilactose).

It is recommended to add Ba(OAc) 2 to NaOH solutions several hours before using the alkaline eluent (i. e., 12 - 24 h) to ensure complete barium carbonate precipitation in the eluent reservoir. Adopting such a simple strategy can be especially useful for performing carbohydrate separations under isocratic conditions in which no regeneration and or re-equilibration of column between runs is required.

For the first time, it was demonstrated that DA, a nonelectroactive compound, is ECL active and is responsible for the ECL behavior of H(2) A. This fact, together with the lack of a DA standard, suggested the use of a calibration graph obtained for H(2) A, for determining both analytes. The proven ECL activity of DA, together with literature data relative to the standard redox potentials of the different species coming from H(2) A, led to a reconsideration of the proposed ECL reaction mechanism for H(2) A. The role of the OH- ion in the reaction mechanism of the two analytes appeared to be crucial, H(2) A and DA could be separated by a suitable C- 18 -reversed-phase HPLC column using an aqueous 30 mN H 3 PO 4 solution as the mobile phase.

40|$|A {{simple and}} fast {{approach}} for solid phase extraction is herein described, {{and used to}} determine trace amounts of Pb 2 + and Cu 2 + metal ions. The solid phase support is sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -coated &# 947;-alumina modified with bis(2 -hydroxy acetophenone) - 1, 6 -hexanediimine (BHAH) ligand. The adsorbed ions were stripped from the solid phase by 6 mL of 4 M nitric acid as <b>eluent.</b> The eluting <b>solution</b> was analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The sorption recovery of metal ions was investigated {{with regard to the}} effects of pH, amount of ligand, &# 947;-alumina and surfactant and the amount and type of eluent. Complexation of BHAH with Pb 2 + or Cu 2 + ions was examined via spectrophotometry using the HypSpec program. The detection limit for Cu 2 + was 7. 9 µg L- 1 with a relative standard deviation of 1. 67 %, while that for Pb 2 + was 6. 4 µg L- 1 with a relative standard deviation of 1. 64 %. A preconcentration factor of 100 was achieved for these ions. The method was successfully applied to determine analyte concentrations in samples of liver, parsley, cabbage, and water...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Newer {{applications}} of radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear medicine require pertechnetate of moderate to high radioactive concentration. Hence {{there is a}} need to develop simple procedures for the concentration of pertechnetate. In this paper the influence of the addition of ascorbic acid to the <b>eluent</b> saline <b>solution</b> on the 99 mTc elution yield is examined. Methods: Molybdenum- 99 produced by neutron activation of molybdenum [98 Mo(n,&gamma;) 99 Mo] in the research reactor of Tehran was converted to zirconium molybdate gel under controlled conditions. The resulting Zr 99 Mo granules were load in two glass columns (internal diameter of 15. 3 mm and length of 70 mm). Initially the 99 Mo activity of each column was measured in a dose calibrator and then calculated for the subsequent days using decay corrections. In order to study the influence of ascorbic acid in the elution efficiency of the generators following solvents used for the elutions: 8 ml of normal saline solution (0. 9 %) and 8 ml of saline containing 20 - 120 &micro;g ascorbic acid per ml. Eluted 99 mTc activity in each column was measured in a dose calibrator and the elution efficiency was calculated. The elution profile of 99 mTc was determined by collecting 2 ml volume fractions of eluates. Results: 99 mTc activity was measured for each column and the 99 mTc (measured) / 99 mTc (theoretical) ratio is determined as a yield. The elution yield for the column eluted with saline solution was 70 % but elution of the generator columns with saline solution containing ascorbic acid increase in radioactive concentration of 99 mTc and its elution efficiency was obtained about 78 %. 99 Mo breakthrough percentage, the proportion of the total radioactivity in the eluate that is present as 99 Mo, molybdenum- 99 activity is measured by dose calibrator was about &lt; 0. 015 % for both columns. Conclusion: We have evaluated the influence of addition of ascorbic acid to the saline solution in an attempt to minimize the reduced yields observed after storage of 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generators. The results demonstrate that addition of ascorbic acid at low concentrations in the saline eluant was found to be an effective method of maintaining good 99 mTc yields. However, for a possible routine use of this procedure further investigations are needed. &nbsp...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and use of silica capillaries with modified inner surfaces for sample introduction into an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) by a Direct Injection Nebuliser (DIN) is described and demonstrated. A novel approach to attach organic molecules to the silanol groups of activated fused silica capillaries is presented. These capillaries were extensively tested in terms of their matrix interference removal, separation of species and chromatographic behaviour. The effects of sample pH, carrier <b>solution,</b> <b>eluent</b> strength, sample size and flow rate characteristics were studied in addition to the optimisation of DIN-ICP-MS conditions. The elimination of 40 Ar 23 Na+ interference on 63 Cu determination has been demonstrated by the modification of the capillaries with 2 -(2 -ethylamino) pyridine as complex forming reagent that interact with copper ions and retard them on the capillary. This nucleophilic phase was attached to a cyanuric chloride functional group by using trimethoxysilane as mediating molecule. To examine the progress of the coating reactions, the inner surface of the capillaries were scanned via electron microscopy at every stage of the coating procedure. With this method the copper content of two certified reference materials (SLEW- 2 and NASS- 4) was determined and the results obtained were in good agreement with the certified values. Capillaries coated with strong cation exchangers have been used for lead speciation. The strong cation exchanger covering has been tested for its stability over a wide pH range. The interaction of Et 3 Pb+ with the strong cation exchanger was negligible while the inorganic lead can be selectively retained at pH> 7. Upon flushing with 10 - 2 mol L- 1 hydrochloric acid, the capillary can be easily regenerated. The detection limits for triethyllead and for inorganic lead were 90 and 200 ng L- 1 respectively, i. e., absolute detection limits of 0. 3 and 0. 7 pg respectively. In order to demonstrate the capability of the technique for the analysis of an environmental matrix, a sample of urban rainwater was analysed. Capillaries modified by an internal coating of an anion exchanger (amminopropyltrimethoxysilane) proved to be an effective means of separating vanadium species with different oxidation states, i. e., V(V) and V(IV). The newly developed sample introduction method {{has proved to be a}} valid technique for the analysis of environmental samples, with shorter analysis times, minimum sample pretreatment and improved sensitivity compared to other analytical techniques...|$|R
