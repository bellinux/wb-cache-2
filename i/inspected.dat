The difficult of {{high accuracy}} of heat <b>inspect</b> system was how to get the heat information with high accuracy and control the system at real time. In traditional method, the linear system was used to control the feedback of the heat, with the data sampled discrete, the model-based heat <b>inspect</b> of chemical industry was easily influenced by modeling errors and disturbances of complex chemical environment, which cause underreporting or false alarms, the result was not good. So a high accuracy application of sensitive diathermancy design method was proposed and applied in high accuracy chemical unite operation and chemical industry, a heat <b>inspect</b> method of principal component cluster analysis for the chemical industry, the accurate diathermancy heat <b>inspect</b> data was sampled with many sensitive diathermancy in different location, the corresponding heat <b>inspect</b> signal through effective heat <b>inspect</b> method was analyzed to deter the corresponding chemical diathermancy was faulty, with the data fusion method, the accurate data was output to control the system. Simulation results show that with sensitive diathermancy used in chemical unit operation, the heat data is outputted with high accuracy, and it has good application value in chemical industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We propose {{an on-line}} fault {{detection}} and diagnosis framework in sensor networks, called <b>Inspect,</b> {{which is based}} on a hybrid tiered approach to integrity checking. <b>Inspect</b> tiered design combines the benefits of distributed and centralized approaches, thus improving the responsiveness and efficiency of the fault detection. More precisely, <b>Inspect</b> consists of a local tier built at each sensor node and capable of detecting anomalies, and a centralized tier built at the sink and capable of distinguishing between sensor faults and unexpected temporal-spatial variations in the phenomenon, and detecting more complex types of faults. <b>Inspects</b> offers several desirable features: on-line detection, application independence, and increased robustness to temporalspatial variations. Moreover, <b>Inspect</b> provides confidence bounds that can be dynamically tuned according to the user requirements for a better resource management, and addresses the problem of detecting more complex types of faults.
