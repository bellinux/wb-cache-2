40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{developed}} a framework for flood mitigation risk analysis that applies generally to floods, and have applied it {{in this study of}} flood mitigation risk analysis for the Raritan Basin in New Jersey, USA. The framework we {{have developed}} involves a conceptual model of the relation among meteorological activity, hydrological models, infrastructure intervention, fine-grained topography, and economic impact. We {{have developed a}} hydrological model of the Raritan Basin. We used the calibrated model to compute the reduction in stream <b>gage</b> height (<b>water</b> level) over time as a result of implementing sufficient Green Infrastructure to reduce runoff depth by 1 inch throughout a relevant Watershed Management Area. Three scenarios of sufficient GI implementation and their associated costs were evaluated. In an econometric effort, we have developed a non-linear, threshold-based model that relates the cumulated or integrated amount of river activity above flood level to the FEMA insurance payouts, using historical data on both. This model was tested for four communities, and it achieves excellent predictive behavior against historical data, and can be used to relate the hydrological model results directly to FEMA payout records. Many possible water-related explanatory variables for FEMA insurance payouts were considered, and the most effective was found to be the aggregated quantity of water above flood level during the time directly associated to the flooding event that caused the claims and payouts...|$|R
40|$|Tree rings—the {{expression}} of annual cambial growth—from moisture-sensitive species {{can be used}} as non-linear biological proxies for streamflow variability as both streamflow and a tree 2 ̆ 7 s growth respond to or co-vary with precipitation inputs to a watershed hydrologic system. Many researchers have reconstructed streamflow using tree-rings with varying degrees of success, explaining 70 to 80 percent of streamflow variability in sub-continental (3 ̆e 10, 000 km 2) to sub-regional (260 — 10, 000 km 2) basins, particularly in the drought-prone areas of western North America. The objective {{of this study is to}} reconstruct streamflow with statistical validity in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW), a 239 km 2, second- or third-order stream catchment located in the snowmelt-dominated Owyhee Mountains of southwest Idaho. Tree-ring chronologies developed from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa Hook. Nutt.), western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.), and a set of aspect-limited series were tested for significant correlations with streamflow time series for the years 1966 to 1997 and three-site-averaged precipitation time series for the years 1962 to 1996, using correlation procedures in SAS. Significant correlations found between streamflow time series and tree-ring chronologies were investigated further using different curve fits for improvement of the correlations. Transfer functions, from significant but moderate correlations between a one-year-lagged aspect-limited standard tree-ring chronology and gaged February cumulative streamflow (r = 0. 5201, p 3 ̆c 0. 01) and between <b>gaged</b> <b>water</b> year cumulative streamflow (r = 0. 4036, p 3 ̆c 0. 05), were used to reconstruct 110 years of streamflow. Precipitation, an independent dataset that was highly correlated with cumulative water year streamflow (r = 0. 956, p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), was used for model validation and resulted in weak but statistically significant correlations (r = 0. 3575, P 3 ̆c 0. 05 for the February reconstruction and r = 0. 3870, P 3 ̆c 0. 05 for the water year reconstruction). Validation results explain only about a third of streamflow variability: This weak explanation of variability can be attributed to many factors, including a lack of sample depth in the chronologies as mature (older than 100 years) trees were scarce, a lack of sensitivity to soil moisture in the samples, the use of precipitation (a second order approximation) as a proxy for streamflow, and the possible presence of more prevalent limiting growth factors at sampling sites, such as temperature extremes in the high elevations, and site specific, non-climatic effects from logging practices and disease and insect attacks. The scale of the study is also believed to be a contributing factor to the lack of variability explained in the tree-ring signal. Site specific local noise in the tree-ring data is assumed to be amplified in smaller catchments such as the RCEW as a result of less spatial distribution between trees sampled and a lack of sample depth...|$|R

The laminar boundary heat flux on the shock tube wall agreed with Mirel's flat plate theory. Stagnation point heat transfer for circular cylinders at low temperature compared with the theoretical prediction, but for a gas temperature of 922 K the heat fluxes were higher than the predicted values. Preliminary flat plate heat transfer data were measured for laminar, transition, and turbulent boundary layers with and without pressure gradients for free-stream temperatures of 350 to 2575 K and flow Mach numbers of 0. 11 to 1. 9.

In general, although environmental effects were not always consistent, reactivity was least with the low-temperature, low-pressure liquid fluorine. Reactivity was greatest with the warm, high-pressure gaseous fluorine. None of the liquids and greases tested was found to be entirely suitable for use in fluorine systems. Polytrifluorochloroethylene and N- 43, the formula for which is (C 4 F 9) 3 N, did not react with liquid fluorine at atmospheric pressure or 1500 pounds per square inch gage under static conditions, but they did react when injected into liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage; they also reacted with gaseous fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch <b>gage.</b> While <b>water</b> did not react with liquid fluorine at 1500 pounds per square inch gage, it is known to react violently with fluorine under other conditions.

The specific gage approach was used to track hydrological response in the study reach. In order to approach spatial homogeneity across the four gaging locations along the study reach, input discharges were normalized to multiples of mean daily flow (MDF).

40|$|Highway {{construction}} can {{adversely affect}} the natural environment, including {{the quality and}} behavior of valuable groundwater resources. To investigate these affects, a method has been devised and implemented which is capable of monitoring the groundwater conditions within a highway construction zone. The method includes a system of measurement devices which are strategically placed within small watersheds that {{are representative of the}} entire construction zone. These devices, which include groundwater wells, rain <b>gages,</b> and surface <b>water</b> flumes, are arranged in sparse networks aligned along the direction of water flow. This has been done to reduce the cost and complexity of the system and to allow for easy adaptation to future sites and conditions. The installed equipment was monitored for over one year, during which time a method of data organization, manipulation, and analysis was devised and utilized. The data was processed into easy to understand formats that would be accessible to all organizations involved with the construction project. Hydrologic phenomena such as groundwater table fluctuation, recharge, and flow rate, were all analyzed and used in conjunction with other data to represent the aquifers. After studying the behaviors of each watershed, inferences were made on how well the data collection system was able to capture the responses of the aquifer. Since the system was based on a limited network of devices, many estimates and assumptions had to be made which reduced its success at explicitly demonstrating the effects of the construction.

40|$|Developing an {{appropriate}} data collection scheme {{to measure and}} infer surface-subsurface interactions is not always straightforward due to complex spatial and temporal variability in exchange flow paths and hydrologic connectivity. In {{the context of a}} case study, we used a variety of conventional data collection techniques ranging from point to reach spatial scales in combination to better understand the complete picture of surface-subsurface interactions. Additionally, we used these techniques to sort out contributions of individual hyporheic and groundwater exchange components, establish how different data sets can be complementary, and determine where gaps in information arise. Techniques included net changes in stream discharge over two consecutive reaches using both rating curves and dilution <b>gaging,</b> longitudinal channel <b>water</b> balances at a sub-reach scale, groundwater table and stream water surface elevations, shallow vertical head gradients, streambed and aquifer hydraulic conductivities, and water chemistry. Despite each individual data type or method providing valuable information regarding subsurface exchanges, only at some locations were the dominant exchange components identifiable. At most locations, however, subsurface exchange was clearly a combination of hyporheic and groundwater exchanges that could not be separated out even when combining information provided by various techniques. As a result, this study emphasizes that individual data types describing surface water-groundwater exchanges are often not adequate to provide conclusive information. While many data types used in combination will result in {{a better understanding of the}} complexity of these interactions, there is still an obvious need for more advanced methods to identify and quantify subsurface exchanges...|$|R
40|$|A lumped {{parameter}} {{model has}} been developed to simulate monthly water levels and spring flows in the Edwards Aquifer. It is less complex {{and easier to use}} than the existing complex finite difference models for the Edwards Aquifer. The {{lumped parameter model}} was formulated using a discrete, nonlinear, nonstationary system based on control theory. The physical system of the Edwards Aquifer is conceptualized as a series of connected rock filled tanks representing major drainage basins of the aquifer. The model incorporates recharge functions derived from flow loss analysis of the drainage basins above and within the recharge area. The recharge functions estimate monthly recharge and allow for the interaction between groundwater and surface water for each drainage basin. Pumpage distribution coefficients were derived for each drainage basin to estimate monthly pumpage values. Monthly stream <b>gage</b> and aquifer <b>water</b> level data were used for calibrating and verifying the model. Model parameters were obtained {{with the aid of a}} nonlinear optimization algorithm. A Kalman filter was used to improve simulation results. The lumped parameter model proved to be very efficient in simulating 189 monthly iterations of water levels for nine drainage basins in less than four minutes on a 68040 based microcomputer. The model should prove useful for assessing pumpage regulations necessary to maintain springflows under historic drought conditions and for exploring management alternatives for the Edwards Aquifer. Future plans and research consist of re-coding the model as a spreadsheet function and perhaps using a Laplace transform as a solution method. Other research should include generalizing the model for use in other karst aquifers, integrating the model with a rainfall-runoff model, and developing a better method for estimating recharge...|$|R
40|$|A {{professional}} project report submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, the University of New Mexico. The Sandia Canyon Wetland is an effluent supported wetland sustained by three National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted outfalls. The wetland sediments contain an inventory of chromium released from historic operations. Maintaining physical and geochemical stability in the wetland is intended to keep the chromium inventory in its reduced trivalent state to minimize mobility and subsequent offsite migration. Upgrades to the Sanitary Effluent Reclamation Facility (SERF) decreased {{the amount of water}} used in nearby cooling towers, and therefore reduced the volume of effluent discharged into the wetland. SERF provides tertiary treatment to treated sanitary effluent creating water of improved quality to allow for additional cycles of concentration in the cooling towers. In November 2013, a grade control structure was installed at the terminus of the wetland to provide physical stability, to help maintain high groundwater levels in the wetland, and to maintain reducing conditions within the wetland. A network of alluvial piezometers and surface <b>water</b> <b>gages,</b> above and below the wetland, was used to monitor changes of hydrology and geochemistry within the wetland that may have resulted from the decreased effluent volumes and installation of the grade control structure. Water samples were collected from the monitoring network between November 2012 and March 2014. Piezometer water levels showed stable groundwater elevations in the wetland while the presence of ammonium and sulfide suggested reducing conditions were present even after the effluent volumes decreased. The manganese, iron, and chromium concentrations in groundwater and surface water samples further indicate that anaerobic conditions were present in the wetland. Over the monitoring period reported in this project, the results indicate the wetland has sustained reducing conditions to maintain the chromium inventory in the reduced trivalent state...|$|R

Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most low-flow systems are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi.

The modeling procedures and results have been described in ?Water Balance of the 1993 Midwest Flood,? by Mizgalewicz and Maidment (1998). In their report, a water balance was calculated for the Upper Mississippi River basin for all of 1993 using streamflow, precipitation, and evapotranspiration data sets. In both this study, and Mizgalewicz? and Maidment?s study, the Upper Mississippi River basin (UMRB) includes the Mississippi River basin from the river?s headwaters in Minnesota to Cairo, Illinois, and the Lower Missouri River basin below Gavins Point dam, South Dakota, to St. Louis, Missouri (Figure 1. 1). Using a digital elevation model of the study area, the daily flow {{into and out of}} the basin was calculated, and a series of 365 maps of basin water storage were created. The basin was subdivided into watershed boundaries as delineated in ArcInfo using a digital elevation model and a coverage of U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream <b>gaging</b> stations. The <b>water</b> storage values within these watershed boundaries were then spatially averaged into the standard USGS 8 -digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) boundaries, and these maps and data sets were used in the construction of several hydrologic visualization projects.

40|$|The human {{intervertebral}} disc {{is a highly}} inhomogeneous fiber composite pressure vessel. If damaged in the post-infant stage, the disc does not repair and may need surgical correction. Diagnosis of whether a disc is damaged is difficult at best and, at this time, involves invasive techniques which are not free of danger (injection of x-ray opaque liquids). Starting from a desire to develop a noninvasive diagnostic technique based on x-ray and computer aided image enhancement, we {{became interested in the}} mechanical properties of the disc. These would be important in gaging the x-ray detected deformations of the disc under various loads. During the course of this work we became aware of another need of diagnostics related to estimating the proclivity of an intact disc to sustain damage under unusual loads. It turns out that the water content of the disc material dominates its mechanical behavior. Since modern medical equipment such as the EMI-x-ray body-scanner may record quantitatively the water content of the internal body organs, the possibility exists to <b>gage</b> in-vivo <b>water</b> content measurements with the mechanical performance of discs. Because the layers of the disc's annulus fibrosous are so thin, we have had difficulty in preparing single-layer specimens. So far, we have worked mainly with three-layer specimens. That test geometry has been sufficient to establish several important aspects of the mechanical properties. We find that the relaxation behavior is very sensitive to moisture content. Accordingly we have worked with carefully controlled environments including saline solutions claimed to represent body conditions. A major difficulty in obtaining repeatable results is obtaining straight test specimens and holding them in the clamps of the testing apparatus. If moisture and temperature conditioning was repeated without reclamping the specimen, reasonably repeatable results were obtained. No aging was observed after repeated drying and moisturizing cycles. We also found that water diffuses slowly in the layers. The water apparently acts similar to the solvent in a polymer, effecting a change in the relaxation times. Increasing water content causes shortening of relaxation times, drying having the opposite effect. Upon controlling the water content of the specimen we are thus able to measure the relaxation behavior in various time domains. Data covering a wide spectrum of relaxation times is presented which includes all of the time scales experienced by the human body. This mechanical characterization gives us an estimate of how discs respond to different rates of deformation and loading conditions. It is of interest to note that with age (past age 30) the moisture content of the human disc decreases (possible other changes involving increased cross-link density of the mucopolysaccharides as well as an exchange of mucopolysaccharides for collagen). As a result one would expect the human {{intervertebral disc}} to react more stiffly with increasing age under nearly constant speeds of motion. Combining this observation with the changes in the vigor of motion/muscle activity as a function of age allows a tentative explanation of the statistic that the largest incidence of disc problems occur around age 40 - 50...|$|R

40|$|Information on {{the flow}} of rivers and streams is a vital {{national}} asset that safeguards lives, protects property, and ensures adequate water supplies for the future. The U. S.

If you have ever crossed a highway bridge and noticed a metal structure with an antenna {{by the side of}} it, you’ve probably seen a USGS streamgage (fig. 1). A streamgage contains instruments that measure and record the amount of water flowing in the river or stream, or its discharge. Generally, these measurements occur automatically every 15 minutes or more frequently in times of flooding. Words that have the same meaning used throughout this text: Stream stage = <b>gage</b> height = <b>water</b> level Streamflow = discharge = flow Streamflow station = streamgage = gaging station = gage continuously measure streamflow, the gage height of a stream is continuously measured. There is a strong mathematical relation between this height and streamflow and, as a result, a continuous record of streamflow can be calculated from the record of stream stage. Measuring the relative height of streams is done many times a day through an underwater tube contained in the streamgage (fig. 2). Gas is continually pushed through the tube into the stream. As the depth of water above the tube opening increases, more pressure is required to push the gas through the tube. As the water decreases, less pressure is needed to push the gas out. This level of pressure is used to calculate the height of the water above the tube. These changes in pressure are recorded as changes in height, or stage. Stage data are measured usually every 15 minutes. When intense rainfall and runoff cause the river or stream to rise quickly, the time intervals sometimes are shorter. The time interval can be as short as every 5 minutes. These data are transmitted to a satellite on a preset schedule which is usually every 1 to 4 hours. During high water or other emergency situations, data will be sent to the satellite every 15 minutes to provide more timely data. Figure 1. Examples of gage structures located at U. S.

40|$|Part I Regression {{analyses}} are performed on in vivo hemodialysis {{data for the}} transfer of creatinine, urea, uric acid and inorganic phosphate {{to determine the effects}} of variations in certain parameters on the efficiency of dialysis with a Kiil dialyzer. In calculating the mass transfer rates across the membrane, the effects of cell-plasma mass transfer kinetics are considered. The concept of the effective permeability coefficient for the red cell membrane is introduced to account for these effects. A discussion of the consequences of neglecting cell-plasma kinetics, as has been done to date in the literature, is presented. A physical model for the Kiil dialyzer is presented in order to calculate the available membrane area for mass transfer, the linear blood and dialysate velocities, and other variables. The equations used to determine the independent variables of the regression {{analyses are}} presented. The potential dependent variables in the analyses are discussed. Regression analyses were carried out considering overall mass-transfer coefficients, dialysances, relative dialysances, and relative permeabilities for each substance as the dependent variables. The independent variables were linear blood velocity, linear dialysate velocity, the pressure difference across the membrane, the elapsed time of dialysis, the blood hematocrit, and the arterial plasma concentrations of each substance transferred. The resulting correlations are tabulated, presented graphically, and discussed. The implications of these correlations are discussed from the viewpoint of a research investigator and from the viewpoint of patient treatment. Recommendations for further experimental work are presented. Part II The interfacial structure of concurrent air-water flow in a two-inch diameter horizontal tube in the wavy flow regime has been measured using resistance wave <b>gages.</b> The median <b>water</b> depth, r. m. s. wave height, wave frequency, extrema frequency, and wave velocity have been measured as functions of air and water flow rates. Reynolds numbers, Froude numbers, Weber numbers, and bulk velocities for each phase may be calculated from these measurements. No theory for wave formation and propagation available in the literature was sufficient to describe these results. The water surface level distribution generally is not adequately represented as a stationary Gaussian process. Five types of deviation from the Gaussian process function were noted in this work. The presence of the tube walls and the relatively large interfacial shear stresses precludes the use of simple statistical analyses to describe the interfacial structure. A detailed study of the behavior of individual fluid elements near the interface may be necessary to describe adequately wavy two-phase flow in systems similar to the one used in this work. ...|$|R
40|$|Even though {{echinoderms}} {{are one of}} {{the main}} components of the benthic communities, especially in deep <b>waters</b> (<b>Gage</b> and Tyler, 1991), and a great number of studies on Atlantic fauna have been published, little is known about Northwest African echinoderms. The present work shows a first insight on biodiversity and distribution of Northwest African Echinodermata fauna at regional level. Specimens were collected during 10 Spanish and Norwegian multidisciplinary surveys carried out onboard R/V ‘Vizconde de Eza’ and ‘Dr. Fridtjof Nansen’ from 2004 to 2012. A total of 1298 stations were sampled between the Strait of Gibraltar (36 °N) and the Sierra Leona border (9 °N) from 19 to 1888 m depth. We used three different samplers: commercial and beam trawls on soft bottoms, and rock dredge on hard substrates (on the canyon borders, the coral carbonate mounds barrier and the seamount). This research was conducted {{within the framework of the}} EcoAfrik Spanish project, aimed to study the biodiversity of African benthic ecosystems. Echinoderms were collected in 1038 stations — 77 % of the total—, being their catch almost one and a half million of individuals and 28 tons. Excepting Crinoidea, all classes presented an occurrence higher than 50 %, being Asteroidea the most frequent class, appearing in 67 % of the stations where echinoderms were collected. Ophiuroidea and Holothuroidea, the two classes of which taxonomic studies are more advanced, show a high diversity with more than 50 species each. Asteroidea is expected to have a similar diversity, with about 40 to 50 species, while Echinoidea will have lower diversity —about 30 species. Crinoidea seems poorly represented in the region. The echinoderm fauna of Northwest Africa seems dominated by Holothuroidea, which accounted for 91. 5 % of the total biomass, showing the highest values in Mauritanian deep-waters; while the numerical abundance seems dominated by Ophiuroidea (70. 4 %), due to the great abundances found in Western Sahara and Mauritania. Echinoderms diversity shows an increasing pattern from tropical latitudes (Guinea) to northern Mauritania and Western Sahara (20 ºN- 25 ºN) which constitute the richest area. Densities follow similar distribution pattern showing the highest figures along Mauritania and Western Sahara (17 ºN to 24 ºN), while the highest biomass seem concentrated in Mauritania (16 ºN- 20 ºN). A small pick is also observed for the three variables at 10 ºN- 11 ºN of latitude in Guinea Bissau waters. These patterns could be related with the high richness of the waters, the upwelling’s permanence along the year and the important offshore productivity exported through eddies and filaments occurring in northern Mauritania and Western Sahara (Demarq and Soumou, 2015) MAVA (Contract 12 / 87 AO C 4 / 2012...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a detailed}} buckling {{evaluation of the}} primary tanks in the Hanford double-shell waste tanks (DSTs), {{which is part of}} a comprehensive structural review for the Double-Shell Tank Integrity Project. This work also provides information on tank integrity that specifically responds to concerns raised by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health (ES&H) Oversight (EH- 22) during a review of work performed on the double-shell tank farms and the operation of the aging waste facility (AWF) primary tank ventilation system. The current buckling review focuses on the following tasks: (1) Evaluate the potential for progressive anchor bolt failure and the appropriateness of the safety factors that were used for evaluating local and global buckling. The analysis will specifically answer the following questions: (a) Can the EH- 22 scenario develop if the vacuum is limited to - 6. 6 -inch <b>water</b> <b>gage</b> (w. g.) by a relief valve? (b) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario can develop? (c) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario cannot develop? (2) Develop influence functions to estimate the axial stresses in the primary tanks for all reasonable combinations of tank loads based on detailed finite element analysis. The analysis must account for the variation in design details and operating conditions between the different DSTs. The analysis must also address the imperfection sensitivity of the primary tank to buckling. (3) Perform a detailed buckling analysis to determine the maximum allowable differential pressure for each of the DST primary tanks at the current specified limits on waste temperature, height, and specific gravity. Based on the concrete anchor bolt loads analysis and the small deformations that are predicted at the unfactored limits on vacuum and axial loads, it is very unlikely that the EH- 22 scenario (i. e., progressive anchor bolt failure leading to global buckling of the tank under increased vacuum) could occur. After releasing Revision 0 of this report, an independent review of the Double Shell Tanks (DST) Thermal and Operating Loads Analysis (TaLA) combined with the Seismic Analysis was conducted by Dr. Robert P. Kennedy of RPK Structural Mechanics Consulting and Dr. Anestis S. Veletsos of Rice University. Revision I was then issued to address their review comments (included in Appendix D). Additional concerns involving the evaluation of concrete anchor loads and allowables were found during a second review by Drs. Kennedy and Veletsos (see Appendix G). Extensive additional analysis was performed on the anchors, which is detailed by Deibler et al. (2008 a, 2008 b). The current report (Revision 2) references this recent work, and additional analysis is presented to show that anchor loads do not concentrate significantly {{in the presence of a}} local buckle...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} relationship between sediment sample data taken at Potential Release Sites (PRSs) and storm water samples taken at selected sites in and around Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The PRSs had been evaluated for erosion potential and a matrix scoring system implemented. It was assumed {{that there would be a}} stronger relationship between the high erosion PRSs and the storm water samples. To establish the relationship, the research was broken into two areas. The first area was raster-based modeling, and the second area was data analysis utilizing the raster based modeling results and the sediment and storm water sample results. Two geodatabases were created utilizing raster modeling functions and the Arc Hydro program. The geodatabase created using only Arc Hydro functions contains very fine catchment drainage areas in association with the geometric network and can be used for future contaminant tracking. The second geodatabase contains sub-watersheds for all storm water stations used in the study along with a geometric network. The second area of the study focused on data analysis. The analytical sediment data table was joined to the PRSs spatial data in ArcMap. All PRSs and PRSs with high erosion potential were joined separately to create two datasets for each of 14 analytes. Only the PRSs above the background value were retained. The storm water station spatial data were joined to the table of analyte values that were either greater than the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP) benchmark value, or the Department of Energy (DOE) Drinking Water Defined Contribution Guideline (DWDCG). Only the storm water stations were retained that had sample values greater than the NPDES MSGP benchmark value or the DOE DWDCG. Separate maps were created for each analyte showing the sub-watersheds, the PRSs over background, and the storm water stations greater than the NPDES MSGP benchmark value or the DOE DWDCG. Tables were then created for each analyte that listed the PRSs average value by storm water station allowing a tabular view of the mapped data. The final table that was created listed the number of high erosion PRSs and regular PRSs over background values that were contained in each watershed. An overall relationship between the high erosion PRSs or the regular PRSs and the storm water stations was not identified through the methods used in this research. However, the Arc Hydro data models created for this analysis were used to track possible sources of contamination found through sampling at the storm <b>water</b> <b>gaging</b> stations. This geometric network tracing was used to identify possible relationships between the storm water stations and the PRSs. The methods outlined for the geometric network tracing could be used to find other relationships between the sites. A cursory statistical analysis was performed which could be expanded and applied to the data sets generated during this research to establish a broader relationship between the PRSs and storm water stations...|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} {{developed by}} Siddiqui and Drnevich (1995) for measuring soil water content and density using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) was extended for routine {{use in the}} quality control testing of compacted soils. The objectives {{of the study were}} to develop computer software to automate data interpretation and data reduction, develop prototype equipment for field use, compare the results of the TDR method with the sand cone and nuclear density methods on actual construction sites and develop draft specifications for ASTM and AASHTO. New prototype equipment was developed for compaction quality control testing. Waveform interpretation and data reduction were automated by incorporating developed algorithms into a WindowsTM based computer program that is used on a palm top computer connected to the TDR apparatus. Over 150 laboratory and field tests were performed to evaluate the TDR equipment and procedure for use in the determination of moisture content and density of compacted soil. Under field conditions it was shown that the TDR method is more accurate than the nuclear density <b>gage</b> in estimating <b>water</b> content when compared to oven drying, with standard errors of 1. 1 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. The ability to assess the accuracy of the TDR method for determining density was limited because the true density of the compacted soil is not known. The sand cone test was used as a basis for comparing the TDR and nuclear density tests on several sites while accepting that the sand cone test is not an exact method. The time required to perform the TDR test under field conditions is approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The sand cone test can also be performed in approximately 15 minutes, while the nuclear density test can be performed in approximately two minutes. The time required to complete the TDR test relative to the nuclear density test, is viewed as its greatest limitation. In general, the nuclear gage provides estimates of density and water content much more rapidly than the sand cone or TDR tests, is less accurate than the TDR test in estimating water content, and must be calibrated for a specific soil using sand cone tests. Moreover, the nuclear gage uses a hazardous source requiring operators to take safety training and leading to expenses associated with equipment maintenance and disposal. The sand cone test is time consuming, and can not provide estimates of water content. The TDR test is also time consuming, but does provide accurate estimates of water content. At the present stage of the research, the TDR test has not shown great advantage in the measurement of water content and density relative to the nuclear density test. However, progress is being made in the development of an approach to use other features of the reflected waveform, in addition to the apparent dielectric constant, within the interpretation process. It is anticipated that the additional information that can be obtained from the reflected waveform will allow a more accurate estimate of density to be obtained while eliminating the need to [...] ...|$|R
