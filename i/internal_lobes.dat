2500|$|The modern Danube Delta {{began to}} form after 4000 BCE in a bay of the Black Sea, when the sea rose to its present level. A sandy barrier blocked the Danube bay {{where the river}} {{initially}} built its delta. Upon filling the bay with sediment, the delta advanced outside this barrier-blocked estuary after 3500 BCE, building several successive lobes: the St. George I (3500–1600 BCE), the Sulina (1600–0 BCE), the St. George II (0 BC–present) and the Chilia or Kilia (1600 CE–present). Several other <b>internal</b> <b>lobes</b> were constructed in the lakes and lagoons bordering the Danube Delta to the north (Chilia I and II) and toward the south (Dunavatz).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} Neoproterozoic mat-infested {{substrate}} sculptured by inferred bioturbations, excellently preserved within the ca. 600 Ma Sonia Sandstone, northwest India. The bioturbations are horizontal, being preserved on the bed-surfaces and have been classified into linear grooves and discoidal structures. The linear grooves are of two types, one group represents a straight to meandering pattern with raised sand ridges on either side, while the other group represents a mostly meandering pattern with changing width along the length, without raised ridges. Both types of grooves resemble trails of advanced organisms. The discoidal structures have five <b>internal</b> <b>lobes</b> emerging from the centre and merging with the outer ring and may represent body impressions of an organism; alternatively may represent variants of Ediacara or other soft bodied organisms. The interaction of the substrate with these possible bioturbators has great significance in establishing the evolutionary history of the substrate and resulting bioturbations during the Proterozoic. Microbial mats possibly provided oxygen and nutrients to the organisms and {{played an important role}} in their preservation. The study also tries to extrapolate the life style of these trace-makers. All these traces may raise speculation about the onset-time of some higher order organisms.

40|$|The eldonides, a {{group of}} non-mineralised {{asymmetrical}} discoidal fossils characterised by a coiled alimentary canal with circumoral tentacles and radially arranged <b>internal</b> <b>lobes,</b> are perhaps the least-well known major group of Palaeozoic organisms. Their fossil record is primarily known from sites of exceptional preservation, ranging from the Cambrian to the Devonian. Eleven species are known in eight genera and three families (the Eldoniidae, Maoyanidiscidae, and Paropsonemidae), all placed in the Order Eldonida, Class Eldoniata, and the early deuterostome stem-group Cambroernids. The eldonides are of little biostratigraphical or palaeoecological utility. However, they are significant in that while eldoniids are generally preserved as compressions in shales, most paropsonemid specimens are found as moulds and casts in sandstones, a poorly-understood taphonomic mode previously thought to be unique to the oldest known animal fossils, of Ediacaran age. Paropsonemids from the Tafilalt LagerstÃ¤tte (Ordovician, Morocco), were apparently exceptionally preserved in this style by the adsorption of iron ions, produced during decay by iron reduction, to tissues composed of complex biopolymers. These ions provided sites for the nucleation of aluminosilicate clay minerals, {{and the formation of}} iron sulphides (by reaction with hydrogen sulphide produced during subsequent decay by sulphate reduction). These formed moulds of the paropsonemid dorsal surfaces, which were cast by adjacent sediment following the completion of decay. Importantly, comparison to Ediacaran-aged fossils indicates that these were preserved by the same processes, while comparison to fossil eldoniids confirms that this taphonomic style can only preserve tissues composed of complex biopolymers. This suggests that the oldest known animal fossils cannot have been the oldest animals, but merely the first animals to evolve such tissues. It thus appears that Charles Darwin was correct in his proposal that the oldest known animal fossils were preceded by a long period of animal evolution not represented in the fossil record...|$|E
