The design was authorised in April 1928 and the first order was for the Hastings line which required the coach width to be 8 ft 0 in, this was due to clearance issues. First Class compartments only seated two each side, Third Class three each side and roof board brackets were above the rain strip.

50|$|The {{fighting}} compartments {{were connected}} by the engine room. In the design four engines {{had been planned}} but this was reduced to two, each track being powered by its own engine via an electrical transmission. The first engines were of the Chenu type, of 210 hp each. In 1923, these were replaced by captured German 6 cylinder 200 hp Mercedes engines allowing for {{a top speed of}} twelve kilometres per hour. These original engines wore down quickly and were eventually in turn replaced by two 250 hp Maybach engines, 16,950 cc, which rendered a maximum speed of 15 km/h. Between the engines at the left and right side of the hull, a <b>high</b> <b>corridor</b> ran, allowing two electricians standing upright to constantly attend the complex apparatus. Seven fuel tanks, four to the left and three to the right, containing 1,260 litres, gave it a range of 150 kilometres. The suspension contained thirty-nine interleaving road wheels on each side, making for a total of ninety wheels on the tank. Designed to negotiate the challenging terrain of trench warfare, the type had in principle excellent mobility. The Char 2C could cross a trench 425 centimetres wide, enough to pass the typical canal sluices in northern France. A vertical obstacle could be climbed of 170 centimetres and a slope of 70%. The wading capacity was 140 centimetres. Ground clearance was sixty centimetres. The axle track, measured between the inner track sides, was 225 centimetres.|$|E

The whole system was designed with protections for the emission and reception points against smoke, droplets and water vapor generated by a water mist system. It was tested first in laboratory conditions {{in order to assess}} its stability at high temperature or in a water spray. Its accuracy regarding the transmission measurement was then evaluated using a reference material. It was used after these qualifications steps in a fire smoke layer flowing along a corridor ceiling, in order to provide a stratification profile based on transmittance data. Results were compared to the stratification data obtained with classical thermocouple measurements. The analysis showed similar conclusions without spray: the vertical evolution in temperature and transmission indicated a similar smoke-free layer, around 1. 20 m high in the 2. 40 m <b>high</b> <b>corridor</b> when smoke was produced by a 250 kW heptane pool fire in a neighboring room. When studying smoke/mist interactions using a nozzle injecting water in the corridor, a perfect mixing was deduced from temperature measurements, while some discrepancies still appeared with the opacimeters, indicating some variations in the particle concentrations. The opacity could serve to predict these concentration profiles and the visibility in the smoke/droplet medium...|$|E
40|$|Green space {{plays an}} {{important}} role in sustainable urban development and ecology by virtue of multiple environmental, recreational, and economic benefits. Constructing an effective and harmonious urban ecological network and maintaining a sustainable living environment in response to rapid urbanization are the key issues required to be resolved by landscape planners. In this paper, Nanchang City, China was selected as a study area. Based on a series of landscape metrics, the landscape pattern analysis of the current (in 2005) and planned (in 2020) green space system were, respectively, conducted by using FRAGSTATS 3. 3 software. Considering the actual situation of the Nanchang urban area, a “one river and two banks, north and south twin cities” ecological network was constructed by using network analysis. Moreover, the ecological network was assessed by using corridor structure analysis, and the improvement of an ecological network on the urban landscape was quantitatively assessed through a comparison between the ecological network and green space system planning. The results indicated that: (1) compared to the green space system in 2005, the planned green space system in 2020 of the Nanchang urban area will decline in both districts (Changnan and Changbei districts). Meanwhile, an increase in patch density and a decrease in mean patch size of green space patches at the landscape level implies the fragmentation of the urban green space landscape. In other words, the planned green space system does not necessarily improve the present green space system; (2) the ecological network of two districts has <b>high</b> <b>corridor</b> density, while Changnan’s ecological network has higher connectivity, but Changbei’s ecological network is more viable from an economic point of view, since it has relatively higher cost efficiency; (3) decrease in patch density, Euclidean nearest neighbor distance, and an increase in mean patch size and connectivity implied that the ecological network could improve landscape connectivity greatly, as compared with the planned green space system. That is to say, the planned ecological network would reduce landscape fragmentation, and increase the shape complexity of green space patches and landscape connectivity. As a result, the quality of the urban ecological environment would be improved...|$|E

40|$|Many transit {{agencies}} operate limited-stop or Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services overlapped {{with local}} services in corridors with high demand. These service strategies {{have the potential}} to improve bus performance as well as service quality. However, the implementation of these service strategies may lead to an increase in access times and waiting times for some passengers compared with an all-local service configuration. Therefore, agencies face trade-offs between reducing bus running times and reducing total passenger travel time when designing a service plan for these overlapping strategies. This thesis focuses on developing a methodology for the design and evaluation of service configurations for limited-stop (or BRT) services overlapping with local services. The developed methodology proposes evaluating limited-stop (or BRT) service configurations by six measures of effectiveness including: market share (passengers always waiting for the limited-stop service, passengers always waiting for the local service, and passengers always taking the first bus that comes), demand split, average passengers per trip, service running times, change in average passenger travel time, and change in corridor ridership. A model was developed to obtain the proposed measures of effectiveness for user-defined service configurations. This model is an improvement to that developed by Schwarcz (2004) since it allows forecasting ridership changes due to the implementation of these service configurations, assigns demand using a probabilistic choice approach, and models running time changes when BRT elements are introduced. The methodology developed to evaluate limited-stop and BRT services was applied to two CTA case studies: Chicago Avenue and 7 9 th Street. Different scenarios of limited-stop and BRT services overlapped with local services were tested, examining variations in stop spacing, service frequencies, and different BRT elements such as: right-of-way segregation, enhanced boarding, and Transit Signal Priority. The results of the analysis shows the critical importance of the enforcement of preferential rights-of-way (in BRT scenarios) to achieve <b>high</b> <b>corridor</b> performance and that frequency shares (the ratio of limit-stop services buses to local buses serving the corridor in an hour) should be greater than 50 % for limited-stop services and {{greater than or equal to}} 60 % for BRT services. Additionally, total demand, concentration of origins and destinations, average trip length, and trip length distribution were shown to be critical to the effectiveness of limited-stop and BRT services. by Harvey Scorcia.

40|$|For {{this project}} {{it has been}} studied if cable fires can be {{simulated}} in the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) {{with the use of}} the sub-model Lagrangian particles. A full scale test from the cable fire research project called Cable Heat Release, Ignition and spread in Tray Installations During Fire (CHRISTIFIRE) has been used as a reference for the simulations (U. S. NRC. 2013. CHRISTIFIRE (NUREG/CR- 7010), vol. 2). This test consisted of a 7. 3 m long, 2. 3 m wide and 2. 4 m <b>high</b> <b>corridor</b> with three levels of cable trays along one of the walls. The cables were ignited with a 40 kW propane burner which was placed 40 cm from the entrance and 20 cm beneath the lowest cable tray. The corridor test from CHRISTIFIRE was modelled in FDS and the cables were constructed of Lagrangian particles with properties from the cable used during the actual corridor-test. A simplified flame spread-model was used in which each cable was given a heat release rate per unit area (HRRPUA), an ignition temperature and a burn time. The ignition temperature was taken from small scale tests with a pyrolysis combustion flow calorimeter (PCFC) which were conducted as a part of CHRISTIFIRE. The HRRPUA was taken from bench scale cone calorimetry studies of the same cable which was also done in CHRISTIFIRE. The burn time was calculated by hand with the use of data from these tests and information about the amount of combustible material on the cable. Three different ways of modelling the cable particles was tested in order to determine which gave the most realistic result. Sensitivity analyses were made with respect to the parameters HRRPUA, burn time, ignition temperature and grid size. In order to evaluate the results from the simulations, they were compared against the HRR-curve from the full scale test and the αt 2 -fires which are presented in Boverkets allmänna råd om analytisk dimensionering av byggnaders brandskydd (BBRAD 3). The αt 2 -fires are to be used when analytically verifying the construction regulations defined by Boverket. However they are commonly used as a general way to model the fire in FDS simulations since they are considered tested. For the type of cable fires studied in this project however, the αt 2 -fires present a very conservative HRR-curve, both in growth and in maximum HRR. If the fire is too conservative, the whole simulation and the succeeding analysis is in danger of losing its credibility. The results from this project shows that in the particular case which was studied, the model with Lagrangian particles present a HRR-curve which is very similar to the original one from U. S. NRC’s full scale test and much more accurate than the αt 2 -fires. Validerat; 20160110 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
