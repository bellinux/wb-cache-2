Over time and further communication further books were sent and then they were offered a declaration card, and if registered they were offered the chance to form a registered group. In this fashion groups of Bahá'ís were established in Quepos, Limón, Turrialba, Ciudad Quesada, aka San Carlos, and Heredia. In 1947 there was an assembly elected in Quepos though the brief Costa Rican Civil War stopped its meetings for a time. By October 1947 this method was being used in Chile (and continued at least into 1966.)

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} in the section before, Bushwick as well as neighboring East New York are {{the center for the}} Hispanic community in Brooklyn. This history dates back to the post World War II period, when at that time, Bushwick was still a predominantly Irish and Italian American community, when the great migration of Puerto Ricans lead to the growth of enclaves in Brooklyn, East Harlem, the Upper West Side and the Bronx. Originally, Puerto Ricans were located in neighboring Williamsburg, also known as Los Sures, due to the proximity to jobs at the now defunct Domino Sugar Refinery as well as the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but expanded their enclave further into Brooklyn. The sounds of Salsa, corner bodegas and Latin cuisine proliferate the dynamic of the Bushwick community. It is the largest concentration of Hispanic Americans in the entire borough, followed closely behind by Sunset Park. Politically, Bushwick is part of New York's 7th congressional district and is represented in Congress by Puerto Rican born Nydia Velázquez, whose office is in neighboring Williamsburg as well as in Downtown Brooklyn. Nydia Velázquez was the very first woman of Hispanic and Puerto Rican descent to be ever elected to the United States Congress. Bushwick was the birthplace of Rosie Perez, of Puerto Rican descent; best known for her role in In Living Color and on The View , as well as for making her own documentary Yo Soy Boricua, Pa'Que Tu Lo Sepas!. Rosie Perez as well as Jackie Gleason have their faces painted in a mural at the NYPD's 83rd Precinct in Bushwick. Bushwick is also the childhood home of Hollywood actor Rick Gonzalez. The Williamsburg and Bushwick communities are home to their own local Puerto Rican Day Parade [...] The parade board usually meets at the Orocovis Social Club, located off Myrtle Avenue. A popular place with the Hispanic community is La Isla Restaurant, located off Myrtle Avenue and Knickerbocker, where Puerto Rican and Dominican cuisine and flavors keep the restaurant packed {{at all hours of the}} day. On the corner of Broadway, Flushing Avenue and Graham Avenue, where Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford–Stuyvesant meet, in the shadow of Woodhull Medical Center, Graham Avenue becomes the Avenue of Puerto Rico. [...] Located here is a campus of Boricua College and a branch of Puerto Rico based Popular Community Bank. This territory is disputed with local residents claiming that it falls within Bushwick itself, while others claim that it is in fact Williamsburg. Make the Road New York, a Latino community group also has a chapter in the neighborhood. So important is the activism of Latinos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>that</b> in 2016, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaigned in Bushwick order to win over Hispanic votes. Furthermore, a web show, East Willy B was created to display the struggles of the local Latino community. Another infamous spot is the Kikiriki Vivero, located on Myrtle Avenue, a Puerto Rican style butcher shop that sells live poultry, and is [...] notable for its multi-color neon light signs. In both the New York State Senate and City Council Bushwick is represented by Latinos, Martin Malave Dilan of Puerto Rican descent in the State Senate and Antonio Reynoso of Dominican American descent. in City Council. In addition to this Diana Reyna, who formerly represented the area in City Council went on to become deputy borough President of Brooklyn, under Eric Adams.|$|E
