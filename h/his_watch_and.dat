5|$|In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax {{question}} Arthur Leigh Allen, {{a suspect}} in the Vallejo case. Allen behaves suspiciously during the interview. They ask to see <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> notice that he wears a Zodiac brand wristwatch which has the same logo used by the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming increasingly paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with the Riverside Police Department, angering both Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is bothered when Graysmith shows up at the theater where Toschi is watching a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case, with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In Macau, {{three men}} {{break into a}} house, shoot a French woman (Sylvie Testud) and kill {{her husband and two}} children. The woman's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his {{daughter}} who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of euros and <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.|$|E

25|$|Moro {{was wearing}} the same grey clothes he had during the kidnapping. The cravat had several blood stains, traces of sand {{were found in the}} pockets and socks, and traces of {{vegetables}} were also found. Eventually the terrorists declared that they had intentionally added those traces in order to sidetrack the investigators. In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> some spent cartridges. Moro had also a wound at the thigh, likely suffered during the initial assault in via Fani.|$|E
25|$|On 4 September 1815 Quesnel was {{retired from}} the army. In April 1819, he {{suddenly}} disappeared and his corpse was found floating in the Seine in Paris. <b>His</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> a valuable piece of jewelry were found on his body. One source asserted that his death {{could not have been}} a suicide because he was held in high regard in military circles and gave no hint that morning that something was wrong. It was suggested that certain individuals threw him off the Pont des Arts (bridge) for political reasons. QUESNEL is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on the west panel.|$|E
25|$|While {{acting as}} Governor of Xuzhou, Su Shi in 1078 AD wrote a {{memorial}} to the imperial court about problems faced in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture which was under <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> administration. In an interesting and revealing passage about the Chinese iron industry during {{the latter half of}} the 11th century, Su Shi wrote about the enormous size of the workforce employed in the iron industry, competing provinces that had rival iron manufacturers seeking favor from the central government, as well as the danger of rising local strongmen who had the capability of raiding the industry and threatening the government with effectively armed rebellion. It also becomes clear in reading the text that prefectural government officials in Su's time often had to negotiate with the central government in order to meet the demands of local conditions.|$|E

25|$|On June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, {{center console}} Jupiter boat, named the T.T. Zion, landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15a.m., with its {{navigation}} lights on and engines still running, {{according to the}} Sun-Sentinel. Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched {{up and down the}} beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. A search of his house found that <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> wedding band had been left behind. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department said that even though the investigation remains open, there have been no significant leads in the case.|$|E
500|$|During early Eastern Han, {{the loss}} of Han's control over the Ordos Desert {{prompted}} the Han court to reduce the provinces to twelve—excluding the capital region—in 35 AD. In that year, the Inspectors-cum-Governors were still appointed by the central government, but their staffs were recruited from local administrations where they were transferred. By 42 AD, the title Governor once more became [...] Inspector, who remained the head of provincial authorities until 188 AD. In 188 AD, {{at the urging of}} the official Liu Yan, Emperor Ling reinstated the office of Governor, yet some of the provinces were still administered by Inspectors; this arrangement remained in place {{until the end of the}} Han dynasty in 220 AD. A key difference between the roles was that an Inspector had no executive powers and only an advisory role, whereas a Governor could execute decisions on his own behalf. There were exceptions to this rule. If banditry or rebellion simultaneously arose in several commanderies under his jurisdiction at once, the Inspector was authorized to raise troops throughout all commanderies under <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> lead this united force as commander to quell the disruption.|$|E
500|$|Petty thief Louis [...] "Lou" [...] Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) {{is caught}} {{stealing}} from a Los Angeles construction site by a security guard. He attacks the guard, steals <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> leaves with the stolen material. After selling the material at a scrap yard, Lou {{asks for a}} job, but the foreman {{says he does not}} hire thieves. While driving home, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), tells Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations. Inspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) tells him the station is especially interested in footage of violent incidents in affluent areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou begins tampering with crime scenes and in one case moves a body. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.|$|E

500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of the cars. The man checks <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> puts a CD in the car's stereo before the video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who opens the car's passenger door. The next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look down on them from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building. The Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] single.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, in {{the earlier}} phase of Berlin's career, {{producer}} and composer George M. Cohan, during a toast to the young Berlin at a Friar's Club dinner in his honor, said, [...] "The thing I like about Irvie is that although he has moved up-town and made lots of money, it hasn't turned his head. He hasn't forgotten his friends, he doesn't wear funny clothes, {{and you will find}} <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> his handkerchief in his pockets, where they belong." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers {{had become}} one of America's {{favorite}} theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, [...] "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> ad-libbed, [...] "The 9:20's right on time.

In 1920, he established Montres Rolex S.A. in Bienne. The name [...] "Rolex" [...] was given because it is easily pronounceable in many languages. It was also short enough to fit {{on the face of}} <b>his</b> <b>watches.</b> Wilsdorf ultimately moved his company to Geneva in 1919.|$|R

[...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe what I just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to expanding Fitch's land holdings, Lyder campaigned {{to increase the}} number of facilities available to campers. [...] A pool and inland lake were built to expand the aquatics program. [...] All bath facilities were upgraded under <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> several residential lodges constructed. [...] Programming areas received roofs to shields campers from snow and rain, and a 40-foot climbing tower was constructed. [...] The most significant facility impacts during his tenure, however, were the creation of cabents and the construction of a new Dining Hall. [...] With the new dining hall in place, the camp's dining capacity was expanded to accommodate 1000 guests at a time. [...] With these new accommodations in place, Fitch has recently started to host corporate retreats and conferences throughout the year.|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{was also}} {{featured}} in {{an episode of}} , where he {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Greatest Human Being That Ever Lived". In that episode, Penn & Teller play a card game where each card depicts a great person in history. Each player picks a few cards at random, and bets on whether one thinks one's card shows a greater person than the other players' cards based on a characterization such as humanitarianism or scientific achievement. Penn gets Norman Borlaug, and proceeds to bet all his chips, his house, his rings, <b>his</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>and</b> essentially everything he's ever owned.

Liberal Knesset Member Stav Shaffir encouraged J Street to hone the message of the pro-peace camp in Israel as well as the U.S., and she [...] "brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly as she described the battle ahead for a two-state solution". J Street followed Obama1's lead in considering international alternatives to direct negotiations between the Israeli government and Palestinians.|$|E
2500|$|Several reasons {{have been}} put forward that {{may have contributed to}} why Klinghoffer was chosen. Earlier in the {{hijacking}} he had refused to be silent when gunmen took <b>his</b> <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> cigarettes, becoming brusque and complaining in his slurred speech which antagonized some of the hijackers though one of them gave Klinghoffer his possessions back. Additionally Klinghoffer was Jewish and American, and his wheelchair made him both hard to move around the ship and meant his extended absence from the main group was less likely to trigger a chain reaction of resistance among the surviving hostages. Molqi later gave a statement on why he was chosen [...] "I and Bassm [...] agreed that the first hostage to be killed had to be an American. I chose Klinghoffer, an invalid, so that they would know that we had no pity for anyone, just as the Americans, arming Israel, do not take into consideration that Israel kills women and children of our people." ...|$|E
