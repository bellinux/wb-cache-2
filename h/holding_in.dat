5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> Oneida II.|$|E

30|$|Let now u≥ 1. If 0 < p≤ 1, then {{inequality}} (1) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> {{the reverse}} direction and, therefore, since u/p> 0, also (2) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction. If q≥ 1, then inequality (3) holds, and since 1 -u/q≤ 0 in this case, {{we conclude that}} (4) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction. In the case q< 0, inequality (3) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction, but since 1 -u/q≥ 0, inequality (4) <b>holds</b> <b>in</b> the reverse direction also in this case.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) are dating each other, {{which they have}} been <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Andy {{attempts}} to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover {{does not have to be}} awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better.|$|E

5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E

Allahverdi II Hasan-Jalalyan, who was to die in 1813, was the final melik of Khachen when the Russian Empire first entered the region in 1805 during the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813. In 1828, following {{the end of the second}} Russo-Persian War, when per the outcome as confirmed in the Treaty of Turkmenchay and Persia's forced ceding of the last territories it was <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> the South Caucasus, the Russians finally dissolved the office of Catholicos.|$|E

5|$|The Afroyim {{decision}} {{stated that}} no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship. Nevertheless, the Court distinguished a 1971 case, Rogers v. Bellei, <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis, through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents, could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways, since their citizenship (unlike Afroyim's citizenship) {{was the result of}} federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause. The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship—a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth—was repealed by Congress in 1978; the foreign voting provision, already without effect since Afroyim, was repealed at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a joint-venture agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire <b>holding</b> <b>in</b> August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E
