5|$|On the August 29, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and {{defeated}} Victoria. She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, {{and had a}} series of matches against them. In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs <b>kicked</b> <b>her</b> off, implying that a second person was under the ring. The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward. Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating Victoria and Natalya. They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months.|$|E

25|$|Raymond Leslie Morris {{was born}} on 13 August 1929 in Walsall, Staffordshire. He lived in Walsall his entire life and was {{reported}} to have an IQ of 120. Morris went through a variety of jobs before landing a position as a foreman engineer at a precision instruments factory in Oldbury, West Midlands, in 1967. In 1951, he married 'the girl next door", who was two years younger than him, and fathered two boys. He <b>kicked</b> <b>her</b> out of the house after eight years of marriage, then divorced her on the grounds of adultery when she had another man's child. Morris's first wife would later describe him as a man with a need to express violent sexual dominance. At the age of 35, Morris was married again, this time to a 21-year-old woman named Carol. He had been suspected of taking indecent photographs of schoolgirls in October 1966, though he was not arrested as police failed to find any evidence. At the time the A34 murders were committed, Morris and his wife lived at Flat 20, Regent House, Green Lane, Walsall – a council-owned flat in Birchills, directly opposite the police station.|$|E

25|$|In 2012 Nicole visited Leanne {{after her}} brother Eric (Mick Andrews) had a severe {{schizophrenic}} episode.

However, when Nicole suggested Leanne was the issue, she <b>kicked</b> <b>her</b> out only {{to show up}} in Ferndale with Eric. Following Eric being sent into care, Leanne made it clear that she thought Nicole should date Vinnie over girlfriend Harper Whitley (Ria Vandervis). She returned to her role as receptionist at the hospital having sold her house in Tauranga. Leanne had a brief flirtation with Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain) after mistakingly believing he and his wife Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) were swingers. She began to date Nev Carlson (Stuart Devenie) much to the angst of Nicole, but he left her for one of his five ex-wives. Leanne soon found herself becoming a burden to her family but this changed when she began to date Howard Black (Michael Saccente) who lavished her in expensive gifts. Though it soon turned out he had a potentially terminal illness and he returned to America, with Leanne nearly joining him on the day of Nicole's wedding. In 2016 Leanne began to feel elderly and underwent plastic surgery only for the anaesthetic not to work, leading to her being awake during the aborted procedure. Feeling increasingly unwanted at work, Leanne was overjoyed when Howard returned to Ferndale. The two decided to marry and after realising how much she needed to move on, she left Ferndale. 3 months later, Leanne returned to Ferndale temporarily after her honeymoon with Howard although it soon turned out he had fallen overboard of the cruise ship and had drowned.|$|E

25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} the riots began. According to one source they were sparked by a {{physical}} altercation between a Japanese marine and a local ricksha puller, in which the latter was seriously injured. When a coolie attempted to come to the assistance of the ricksha puller, the marine stabbed him through the heart with his sword. Rather than disciplining the marine for his conduct, the Japanese naval commander ordered a detachment of troops to fire machine guns at a crowd of protestors who had gathered around the concession. The conflict between Japanese troops and Chinese protestors eventually led to dozens of fatalities. According to Japanese reports little after 3:00 PM on 3 April Chinese children threw stones at two sailors who were passing by Tsumazuru, a luxury restaurant on Xiechang Road in the Japanese concession in Hankou. In the ensuing verbal altercation, about 30 Chinese turned upon the sailors and then a group of rickshaw pullers surrounded them and started to beat them. The sailors knocked over one of the rickshaw men and took refuge in the nearby restaurant Yamayoshi. Immediately Chinese onlookers entered the fray and both Yamayoshi and a neighbouring restaurant, the Naniwa Buffet, were utterly destroyed. To make matters worse, false rumors were spread that Japanese sailors had killed Chinese and that a rickshaw man had been stabbed with a knife. Just then, near Pinghe Street on the northern side of the Japanese concession, a group of Chinese who were taking part in the celebratory procession of an organizational meeting of the farmers’ association instead stormed the Japanese concession, two thirds of which was engulfed by the mob. When they saw Japanese people, they surrounded them and beat them, and Japanese businesses were attacked one by one. The attacks of these rioters were undertaken in a thorough and precise manner. The vice-consul Tanaka rushed to the scene when he heard about the disturbances but although he called out to the crowd that he was a consul, he was still assaulted. At the house of a certain Mr. Tamura near the barbershop at the corner of Nanxiao Road and Pinghe Street the mob found his wife, who was lying in a sickbed shortly after giving birth, and <b>kicked</b> <b>her</b> to death before abandoning her corpse where they killed her.|$|E
