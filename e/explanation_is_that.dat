5|$|Cats do eat grass occasionally. A {{proposed}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cats use grass as {{a source}} of folic acid. Another proposed <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is used to supply dietary fiber, helping the cat defecate more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> females {{might prefer}} {{brighter}} males, so sexual selection {{could result in}} aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate. Sexual selection {{is strong enough to}} allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait.|$|E

5|$|A ring could {{possibly}} exist in Himalia's orbit. One possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a small moon had crashed into Himalia {{and the force}} of the impact caused material to blast off Himalia.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E

5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the castle was guarded by five men. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged the town and the castle was overcome by artillery positioned on the higher ground of the overlooking hill behind it. An earthwork fort, called Gallants Bower, may subsequently have been built to protect this vulnerable position; an alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth. He first took the town, then Gallants Bower, before forcing the surrender of Sir Hugh Pollard, the castle's commander, the following day. The Carews' house was probably badly damaged during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of the surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
50|$|In Braid’s view (given {{that many}} of the proponents of such views were decent men, and that their {{experiences}} had been honestly recounted), the only possible <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> their observations <b>were</b> seriously flawed.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E

50|$|On 23 June 2009, Slovenia {{blocked the}} closing of another chapter in Croatia's EU {{accession}} negotiations, Statistics, leaving Zagreb {{with a total of}} 13 blocked chapters.

5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A possible <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun {{when he was still}} sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of coins {{deposited}} at the beginning of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|E
