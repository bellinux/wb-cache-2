The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting. Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed, increasing the Mastiff's speed without losing the breed's ferocity. This step reduced the Old <b>English</b> Bulldog's <b>size</b> and weight, with the Greyhound's features seen in specimens of that time.|$|R

The {{participants in this study were}} 89 students divided into two sections: section one (40 students) and section two (49 students). The students were finishing a two-year EFL program, which prepares them for a three-year Arabic-English/English-Arabic translation program. In order to determine the relationship between vocabulary size and morphological awareness, it was necessary to first measure these two variables in the participants in the study. Two types of tests were used: the Vocabulary Size Test and the Morphological Awareness Test. The Vocabulary Size Test was used to estimate the vocabulary size of the students, which could range from 1, 000 to 14, 000 word-families. The results showed that the vocabulary size in both sections of students was over 4, 000 word-families. The Morphological Awareness Test included two subtests: the Morphological Structure Test and the Morpheme Identification Test. They were used to estimate the level of morphological awareness. The findings showed that the students' overall morphological awareness level was relatively low. To answer the research question concerning the relationship between <b>English</b> vocabulary <b>size</b> and morphological awareness, correlational analyses were done to test for a relationship between vocabulary size and morphological awareness scores on the two tests in the two sections of classes. The results of the correlation tests indicated that there was no relationship between the two variables in both sections.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{primary and secondary}} morphological family size effects in monolingual and bilingual processing, combining experimentation with computational modeling. Family size effects were investigated in an English lexical decision task for Dutch-English bilinguals and English monolinguals using the same materials. To account {{for the possibility that}} family size effects may only show up in words that resemble words in the native language of the bilinguals, the materials included, in addition to purely English items, Dutch-English cognates (identical and non-identical in form). As expected, the monolingual data revealed facilitatory effects of <b>English</b> primary family <b>size.</b> Moreover, while the monolingual data did not show a main effect of cognate status, only form-identical cognates revealed an inhibitory effect of <b>English</b> secondary family <b>size.</b> The bilingual data showed stronger facilitation for identical cognates, but as for monolinguals, this effect was attenuated for words with a large secondary family size. In all, the Dutch-English primary and secondary family size effects in bilinguals were strikingly similar to those of monolinguals. Computational simulations suggest that the primary and secondary family size effects can be understood in terms of discriminative learning of the English lexicon. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Bilingual parents (who spoke English and another language; N = 181) completed the Language Mixing Scale, a new self-report measure that assesses how frequently parents use words {{from two different}} languages in the same sentence, such as borrowing words from another language or code switching between two languages in the same sentence. Concurrently, <b>English</b> vocabulary <b>size</b> was measured in the bilingual children of these parents. Most parents reported regular language mixing in interactions with their child. Increased rates of parental language mixing were associated with significantly smaller comprehension vocabularies in 1. 5 -year-old bilingual infants, and marginally smaller production vocabularies in 2 -year-old bilingual children. Exposure to language mixing might obscure cues that facilitate young bilingual children’s separation of their languages and could hinder the functioning of learning mechanisms that support the early growth of their vocabularies...|$|R

Data from a pilot study for a cognate-controlled <b>English</b> vocabulary <b>size</b> {{test was used to}} assess whether a group of Japanese university English learners (n = 60) were more successful at responding to cognate items than noncognate ones in three 1000 word frequency bands on a Japanese-English translation task. The results showed a statistically significant difference between scores achieved on cognate and noncognate items at the 2000 and 3000 frequency levels, but not at the 1000 frequency level. The findings suggest that cognate items may be easier for test-takers to respond to than noncognate ones of similar frequency, indicating the importance of ensuring that their respective proportions in tests are representative of those inherent in the frequency bands they have been sampled from. It is also argued that such representativeness may best be achieved via a stratified item sampling approach.|$|R

Here we build on insights from previous macro-level research on crime, and microeconomic analyses of ecrime to develop a set of hypotheses to predict which variables are correlated with national participation levels in crowd-sourced ecrime. Some hypotheses appear to hold, e. g. Internet penetration, <b>English</b> literacy, <b>size</b> of the labor market, and government policy all are significant indicators of crowd-sourced ecrime market participation. Greater governmental transparency, less corruption, and more consistent rule of law lower the participation rate in ecrime. Other results are counter-intuitive. GDP per person is not significant, and unusually for crime, a greater percentage of women does not correlate to decreased crime. One finding relevant to policymaking is that deterring bidders in crowd-sourced labor markets is an ineffective approach to decreasing demand and in turn market size. ...|$|R

Students achieved high scores for high-frequency words but scored poorly for low-frequency words.
