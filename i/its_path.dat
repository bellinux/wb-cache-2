At every fixed point {{the paths of}} [xi] are continuous, or differentiable, with probability zero or one.

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along <b>its</b> <b>path.</b> In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
