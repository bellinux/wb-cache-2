2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society.

Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain.

The 2003 ROSC update noted important further progress by Slovakia in bringing fiscal transparency close to international best practice, including by improving the coverage {{and availability of}} fiscal information; advancing work on international reporting standards; and improving the reporting of contingent liabilities and expenditure arrears. The government has clarified financial relations with state-owned enterprises, applying an <b>ex</b> ante <b>dividend</b> policy in preparing the public administration budget for 2005 – 07.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a rigorous theoretical model to assess when investor clienteles may be empirically identified using <b>ex</b> <b>dividend</b> day data and what firm attributes these clienteles should respond to. It then presents empirical {{results for the}} period 1963 - 1977 suggesting that (1) tax-based investor clienteles do exist, and are reasonably stable over time (2) these clienteles are strongly influenced by the dividend-price ratio, but insignificantly by direct measures of risk and other firm characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that early {{exercise}} of an American put may not be optimal for some time before the asset goes <b>ex</b> <b>dividend.</b> This in turn implies that the early exercise boundary is not as smooth as for a put with a constant dividend yield. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to illustrate that a straightforward numerical implementation of the time discrete method of lines for the Black Scholes equation can readily cope with the disappearance and reappearance of the early exercise boundary. The performance of the method is illustrated by computing option prices when dividends are paid discretely at a known rate or known amount, as well as with a constant dividend yield...|$|E
40|$|Cash {{dividends}} and rights {{issues on the}} Istanbul Stock Exchange are commonly accompanied by large stock dividend payments. This paper tests the proposition that stock dividends {{have no effect on}} company value, using a novel GARCH process with event-related intercept terms to capture induced changes in the volatility of stock prices. Returns rise in advance of stock dividend payments, but this effect becomes statistically insignificant when proper allowance is made for heteroscedasticity. Volatility rises after stock dividend payments, and this is attributed to persistence following exceptionally large price movements around the <b>ex</b> <b>dividend</b> day, rather than to any transitory rise in the unconditional returns variance. The study does document some irrationality in responses to cash dividends, with prices rising/ falling after increased/ decreased dividend payments, rather than after the much earlier dividend announcements...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates if {{the results}} {{distribution}} policy is capable of changing {{the price of a}} company’s shares. The objective of this work is to discuss the impact that paying dividends has on the share price on the <b>ex</b> <b>dividend</b> date of mature and expanding companies; it also considers the effect that the type of share (ordinary or preference) has on the results. To do so the panel data methodology was adopted, which segmented the sample from Kohonen’s self-organizing maps. The results reveal that the short term strategy of buying shares on the last with dividend dateand selling on the first ex-dividend date and collecting the dividends is capable of producing capital losses that are up to four times larger than the net gain from the dividends that are received...|$|E
40|$|Investors are {{continuously}} {{looking to}} increase the return on their investments. In an ideal world investors want {{to increase the}}re return and outperform the market. Theory states {{that it is impossible}} to do so without increasing your risk. Arbitrage is a concept where investors are able to generate risk-free returns exceeding the market. Dividend is a common tool for publicly listed firms when rewarding their shareholders. On ex- dividend day, the day after the dividend payout, the stock price should according to theory decrease in order for the valuation of the stock to be held constant. In our research we investigate if there are arbitrage opportunities in connection to the dividend payouts, namely the ex-dividend effect. We want to generalize our results across experimental settings, thus across different stock markets. As a basis for our research we picked the OMXS. We base our research on three theoretical areas: the dividend irrelevancy theory, the efficient market hypothesis and the anchoring theory. The dividend irrelevancy relates to how the stock price ought to behave on ex-dividend day whereas the efficient market hypotheses states that prices on a market fully reflects all available information. Both theories concur that no arbitrage opportunities should be available on the financial market. The anchoring theory highlights the fact that investors formulate an anchor price for financial assets, for example stocks. In our research we aim to formulate a practical method on how to make abnormal returns on the <b>ex</b> <b>dividend</b> effect, based on the anchoring theory. Our census sample consists of dividend-paying firms publicly registered on the OMXS, and consists of 694 observations taken from 2009 to 2012. The sample was picked on the basis of characteristics, for example that the firm has been registered for at least four years and paid dividend one time during the four years of investigation. In order to tests for arbitrage opportunities on ex-dividend day, we used a simple mathematical model measuring the deviation between the price drop cum-dividend day to ex-dividend day, and the dividend amount. We conclude that the price drop differs from the dividend amount, only accounting for a price drop of 0. 73 of the dividend amount. Thus, the price drop for each dividend unit is 0. 73, in relation to a perfectly efficient market where there should be no difference; hence the price drop would be equal to the dividend amount, 1. Research on the ex-dividend effect is a thoroughly investigated area, where the first research was presented in 1955. Previous research all attempts to explain why there are market anomalies, but none examine how one can capitalize on the findings. In our research we examine if it is possible to make abnormal returns based on a segmenting of stocks, depending on their price volatility. This research is thereby first in examining how to capitalize on found arbitrage opportunities. ...|$|E
