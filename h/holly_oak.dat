5|$|MD7 heads east through {{forest and}} {{scattered}} residential subdivisions through the northern fringe of Joppatowne, where the highway intersects Old Mountain Road and MD152 (Mountain Road). The route crosses Winters Run and intersects Edgewood Road and MD24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) in Edgewood. MD7 crosses Haha Branch and meets Abingdon Road at Abingdon, which {{is home to}} the Nelson-Reardon-Kennard House. The highway intersects MD136 (Calvary Road) in between crossings of Bynum Run and James Run, which flow into the Bush River. MD7 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway as it passes through the commercial area of Riverside, where the highway meets MD543 (Creswell Road) just south of that highway's interchange with I-95. The road passes through forest with isolated residential subdivisions, one of which is served by <b>Holly</b> <b>Oak</b> Circle, which meets MD7 at a roundabout.|$|E
500|$|When Egerton-Warburton {{took over}} the estate, the gardens were mainly {{to the east of}} the hall, but with his wife, Mary, he {{designed}} new gardens. [...] These were developed to the southwest of the hall between 1840 and 1860. [...] They implemented their designs apparently without any professional help, and the present gardens are largely the result of their planning. [...] The herbaceous border {{was one of the first}} of its type to have been created in England. Items they planted which are still present include the yew finials in the herbaceous border, which were planted in 1856, and the <b>holly</b> <b>oak</b> cylinders in the Ilex Walk, which were also planted in the 1850s.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{bypassing}} of {{the original}} Philadelphia Road, improvements continued {{to be made to}} MD7. The state highway was widened with dual [...] shoulders from the Baltimore city limit to Rossville in 1938. MD7 was widened through Havre de Grace in 1953 and through Elkton in 1954. The highway was relocated and became a divided highway on both sides of its intersection with MD543 in Riverside concurrent with the construction of MD543's interchange with I-95 in 1989. MD7's roundabout at <b>Holly</b> <b>Oak</b> Circle in Riverside was installed in 2000. Several portions of the state highway have been transferred to local maintenance. The portion of MD7 to the south of US40 in the southern portion of Aberdeen was removed in 1950; MD159 was extended north to MD7's new eastern terminus and the remainder of Old Philadelphia Road became the responsibility of Harford County and Aberdeen. MD7 between MD213 and South Street in Elkton became one-way eastbound in 2001 and municipally maintained in 2003. The western terminus of that section of MD7 was truncated at MD213 in 2010, resulting in the portion of Main Street from a dead end at the Amtrak Northeast Corridor to MD213 also becoming the responsibility of Elkton. In 2012, the MD7 designation was removed from the portion of municipally-maintained roadway between MD213 and South Street.|$|E

50|$|David Meltzer lists several {{parallels}} between the two. They both have the same orientation and posture, and while most mammoths are shown with bulbous feet, the feet of both the <b>Holly</b> <b>Oak</b> and La Madeleine mammoths end abruptly; in La Madeleine's case, this was because part of the carving is missing, but there is room on the <b>Holly</b> <b>Oak</b> gorget where {{the ends of the}} feet could have been drawn. Furthermore, the contour {{of the back of the}} animal was drawn several times on the La Madeleine tusk, but only once on the <b>Holly</b> <b>Oak</b> gorget - the latter resembles more a modern elephant than a mammoth, which is consistent only with Charles Rau's drawing of the La Madeleine tusk, which was one of the few drawings available to the public. The trunk and tusks also more resemble those of a modern elephant than those of a mammoth, as if the artist misinterpreted the drawing.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} synthetic pollen and microcharcoal {{data from}} the cores TaOr-orchestra and TaSc-scaena collected on-site in the Greek-Roman Theatre of Taormina, which was most probably built in Greek times, around the 3 rd cent. BC and then restructured in Roman times. Data will be considered specifically to improve knowledge on the flora which characterized the site and the surroundings during the theatre’s past life {{with the aim of}} providing the scientific basis for the creation of an historical garden in and next to the theatre. Unfortunately, the cores did not provide undisturbed sequences as they consisted largely of reworked materials. Nevertheless, pollen from the two different points resulted in a relatively long plant list providing coherent, realistic and reliable information on the flora. Comparison with the recent spectra, from moss polster and surface soil samples, shows that past pollen rain was profoundly different from current rain, especially in terms of the presence in recent spectra of various exotics. Pollen indicated that the historical garden should feature: box, myrtle, rose, hawthorn, juniper and cypresses, together with plum, olive, chestnut and walnut trees, vines and also planes, pines, poplars, <b>oaks</b> (including <b>holly</b> <b>oaks)</b> and Acanthus...|$|R
