25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the <b>downcomer</b> and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the <b>downcomer</b> is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the <b>downcomer.</b> The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the <b>downcomer,</b> meaning that the pressure inside the top of the <b>downcomer</b> is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the <b>downcomer</b> by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the <b>downcomer</b> contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the <b>downcomer</b> that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|E
25|$|The cell was 3m high, {{twice the}} height of the early Cells used in MIM's lead–zinc concentrators, as it was thought that {{additional}} residence time would enhance recovery. It used a single <b>downcomer.</b> The <b>downcomer</b> was used to contact the electrolyte with air and the droplets of the organic extractant attached themselves to the air bubbles created in the <b>downcomer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Improvements to {{this early}} design {{included}} {{a focus on}} the weight and wear of the <b>downcomer.</b> The <b>downcomer</b> was originally built with polyurethane-lined steel, and then changed to a high-density polyethylene ("HDPE") construction with seven elements.|$|E
50|$|Self {{supporting}} construction by {{the four}} <b>downcomers,</b> i.e. the four <b>downcomers</b> in the four corners contribute to a rigid framework and requires no hanging frames or equipments.|$|R
25|$|The AISE valves were {{developed}} to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual <b>downcomers</b> become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build {{up in the air}} distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the <b>downcomers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Separate <b>downcomers</b> {{were used}} by most designs, even after Yarrow's {{experiments}} had demonstrated that circulation could still take place amongst the heated tubes alone. Again, the Admiralty boiler (which omitted <b>downcomers)</b> {{was the culmination of}} this approach, placing the superheater within the tube bank, so as to encourage the necessary temperature difference.|$|R
25|$|There was {{significant}} turbulence {{in the areas}} beneath the downcomers. {{that could result in}} particles detaching from bubbles. These turbulent areas were calmed by the addition of conical diffusers beneath each <b>downcomer.</b> They allowed uniform bubble rise velocities {{across the surface of the}} cell by slowing the superficial gas velocity in the high void-fraction area immediately around the <b>downcomer</b> and provided a more even bubble dispersion. It was reported that the diffusers reduced the turbulence by 69% compared with a standard <b>downcomer</b> with no diffuser.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the orifice {{diameter}} {{was increased}} from the 28mm design used in 1990 to 34mm with the Mark II model and 38mm in 1997. This, {{together with the}} larger Mark II <b>downcomer</b> diameter, allowed the slurry flow per <b>downcomer</b> to be doubled from 30m3/h in 1990 to 60m3/h in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Mark III design {{encompassed}} {{the greatest}} {{improvement in the}} technology since its commercialisation. The focus {{was to make the}} technology more robust and easier to use in operations. The total redesign of the <b>downcomer</b> assembly allowed it to be isolated and unblocked much more easily compared to the Mark II design. The Mark III design also saw slurry flow per <b>downcomer</b> to be increased from 60m3/h to 75–85m3/h using larger orifice sizes in the slurry lenses.|$|E
25|$|Although most Yarrow boilers did {{not require}} <b>downcomers,</b> some were fitted with them.|$|R
25|$|Two {{additional}} Cells {{were installed}} at MIM Holdings' Collinsville Coal operations in 1990. These had 10 <b>downcomers</b> each.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of this work, in 1989 MIM ordered four {{full-scale}} Cells, two for the Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator and another two for the new Hilton lead–zinc concentrator to be built at the Hilton Mine, located about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa. The Mount Isa cells had diameters of 1.9m, with three <b>downcomers</b> each, while those at Hilton were 1.3m in diameter and had two <b>downcomers</b> each.|$|R
25|$|The {{increased}} {{distance between}} the downcomers reduced the interaction of aerated slurry discharging from adjacent downcomers. This interaction could reduce overall cell recovery by causing particles collected by bubbles in the <b>downcomer</b> to detach in the pulp tank.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, MIM {{commissioned}} Jameson {{to undertake}} a project to improve the sparger design for flotation columns. Instead, he developed the concept of using a jet in a <b>downcomer</b> to create the bubbles and {{eliminate the need for}} a sparger in conventional flotation columns.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Cell design for SX–EW applications include large, flat-bottomed cell design {{to allow it to}} sit on the ground and large (500mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX–EW applications) lenses fitted to each <b>downcomer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through <b>downcomers</b> to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the <b>downcomers</b> is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the <b>downcomers</b> and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|R
25|$|The Reed boiler {{was used}} by Palmers of Jarrow. It {{was similar to the}} Normand, with <b>downcomers</b> and curved tubes that entered {{cylindrical}} drums perpendicularly.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler {{design is}} characterised by {{its use of}} {{straight}} water-tubes, without <b>downcomers.</b> Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank.|$|R
25|$|The Cell has no {{moving parts}} and no {{requirement}} for compressed air or sparging mechanisms. This results in lower power consumption than the equivalent mechanical or column flotation cells. Maintenance costs are also lower {{because the only}} wearing part is the slurry lens used to create the jet in the <b>downcomer.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{heat was}} also {{applied to the}} {{unheated}} arm, conventional theory predicted that the circulatory flow would slow or stop completely. In practice, the flow actually increased. Provided {{that there was some}} asymmetry to the heating, Yarrow's experiment showed that circulation could continue and heating of the cooler <b>downcomer</b> could even increase this flow.|$|E
25|$|The foam in the <b>downcomer</b> {{is about}} 50–60% air. Because of this, the pulp is {{distributed}} {{in the form of}} thin interfacial slurry films between the bubbles, providing an ideal environment for particle–bubble contact. Collection occurs by migration of the particles within the thin films, which are not much thicker than the diameter of the particles.|$|E

25|$|Three industrial-size single <b>downcomer</b> Jameson Cells {{were sold}} by Xstrata Technology to Shell Canada in 2007 {{for a large}} scale pilot plant project and eight 500mm {{downcomers}} were sold to Syncrude Limited in 2008. In the latter case, the downcomers were used to treat middlings in an existing tertiary oil recovery vessel in a bitumen recovery process patented by Syncrude.|$|E
25|$|The earlier {{models of}} the Jameson Cell used orifice plates to {{generate}} the <b>downcomer</b> jet. The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life. The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment.|$|E
25|$|The high {{probability}} of particle–bubble contact, and subsequent short residence times (five to ten {{seconds in the}} <b>downcomer,</b> allows for a much more compact column design than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1). The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5mm in diameter) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles. Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify {{the difference in the}} flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade concentrates to be produced.|$|E
25|$|The Jameson Cell {{has been}} adopted by Shell Canada and Syncrude for {{floating}} bitumen in the oil sands industry (see Bitumen flotation). Syncrude bought an additional eight 500mm <b>downcomers</b> for its plant in 2012.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, the ore slurry {{and the air}} are {{introduced}} separately to the flotation cell (see Figure 2). The Jameson Cell differs from this traditional approach by mixing the slurry with {{the air in the}} <b>downcomers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler could thus {{dispense}} with separate external <b>downcomers.</b> Flow was entirely within the heated watertubes, upwards within {{those closest to}} the furnace and downwards through those in the outer rows of the bank.|$|R
25|$|A pilot two tonne {{per hour}} (t/h) Jameson Cell with a 100mm <b>downcomer</b> and using an orifice plate {{to create the}} jet was tested in MIM's lead–zinc concentrator. Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the {{flotation}} of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical flotation cell, a conventional column and the Jameson Cell. The Cell gave the best recoveries. This {{was thought to be}} a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell {{and the fact that the}} hydrophobicity of the lead particles decreased over time.|$|E
25|$|The Mumford boiler was {{a variety}} {{built by the}} {{boilermakers}} Mumford of Colchester, intended for use in smaller boats. The tube banks separated into two groups, with the short tubes slightly curved away from each other. Entry into the lower water drum was perpendicular, requiring an almost rectangular drum with the tubes entering on separate faces. The mechanical weakness of such a shape was acceptable in this small size, but limited the boiler's potential. The casing was small and only enclosed part of the upper steam drum, leading directly to a funnel. A single inverted tee-shaped <b>downcomer</b> linked the drums {{at the rear of}} the boiler.|$|E

5000|$|Single drum boiler- used {{mainly for}} the power plants for power generation. The {{pressure}} limit for single drum boilers is {{higher than that of}} the bi drum boilers as the stress concentration is reduced to a greater extent. There exists only one drum and the <b>downcomers</b> are welded to it. Single drum boilers are suitable and can adapt to both reheat and non-reheat type of boilers. They can be designed as Corner tube boiler where the frame is not required as the <b>downcomers</b> itself serves the purpose of it and also they are designed as top supported where the whole boiler assembly needs an external frame and supported by top drum.|$|R
25|$|Subsequently, a {{full-scale}} plant was commissioned at Newlands in the 1988–89 financial year, with six rectangular Cells (1.5m × 3.5m) {{installed in a}} two-stage arrangement. The cells {{in the first stage}} had seven <b>downcomers,</b> while those in the second had six.|$|R
