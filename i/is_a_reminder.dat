5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Her story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> {{that the}} {{universal}} denigration of a group, {{based on the}} behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven {{by the light of}} knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road {{was built on}} the site of Walker's silk mill of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw & Co.|$|E

5|$|Stretford Urban District {{became the}} Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough {{status in the}} United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre {{represents}} John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from {{the arms of the}} de Trafford family; the scythe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Atkinson Clock Tower near Bandaran Berjaya {{was built}} by Mary Edith Atkinson in 1905 in memory of her son, Francis George Atkinson. It was {{formerly}} used as a navigation aid for ships. It {{is only one of}} three pre-World War II buildings to survive the war. The Petagas War Memorial, located near KKIA, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of those who died when they went against the Japanese forces during World War II. It is situated at the place where the Kinabalu Guerrillas were killed by the Japanese army in 1944. The Double Six Monument, located in Sembulan, is also a memorial to remember Sabah's first Chief Minister and six other state ministers who died on a plane crash known as the Double Six Tragedy on 6 June 1976.|$|E
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

It is also compared to a student who respectfully backs away from his teacher.|$|E
25|$|The logo of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) {{is a red}} chalice with a white St. Andrew's Cross. The chalice {{represents}} the centrality of Communion {{to the life of}} the church.

25|$|The Torah {{says that}} it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that {{there was no time to}} allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the rapid {{departure}} of the Exodus. Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.|$|E

25|$|The {{lion and}} the four stars of the Southern Cross on the St George's Cross have {{reference}} to the State of New South Wales which established the university; the open book with scientia ("knowledge") across its pages <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of its purpose. The placement of scientia on the book was inspired by its appearance on {{the arms of the}} Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine formed in 1907. Beneath the shield is the motto Manu et Mente ("With hand and mind"), which was the motto of the Sydney Technical College from which the university developed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for {{different}} purposes. In one case, for example, {{they go to}} Prajāpati, their father, {{to understand what is}} Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.|$|E
25|$|From {{a social}} and {{cultural}} standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that it expresses to this day the lifestyle of the area's wealthy families during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of how they lived and how World War II changed that lifestyle for ever. The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today's way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy of yesterday.|$|E
