40|$|Modeling spatial {{patterns}} and processes {{to assess the}} spatial variations of data over a study region {{is an important issue}} in many fields. In this paper, we focus on investigating the spatial variations of <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> after a main shock. Although <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> have been extensively studied in the literatures, to our knowledge, there does not exist a suitable spatial model for assessing the problem. Therefore, we propose a joint modeling approach based on spatial hierarchical Bayesian models and spatial conditional autoregressive models to describe the spatial variations in <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> over the study region during two periods. A family of stochastic algorithms based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is then performed for posterior computations. The probabilistic issue for the changes of <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> after a main shock is also discussed. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the earthquake records for Taiwan before and after the Chi-Chi earthquake. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{resources}} poured into analyzing crustal movements and having expert committees determine <b>earthquake</b> <b>risk,</b> for instance, researchers never {{considered the possibility}} of a magnitude-9 earthquake followed by a massive tsunami. The failure of multiple safety features on nuclear power plants has raised questions about the nation's engineering prowess. Government flip-flopping on acceptable levels of radiation exposure confused the public, and health professionals provided little guidance. Facing a dearth of reliable information on radiation levels, citizens armed themselves with dosimeters, pooled data, and together produced radiological contamination maps far more detailed than anything the government or official scientific sources ever provided.|$|E

25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed seismic hazard assessment of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed seismic hazard analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of <b>earthquake</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as comprehensive understanding of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have put effort into developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E

The surface soil is composed mostly of silt loam, derived from eroded loess, and is found in different qualities and at different stages of erosion. The stratum beneath the surface consists of glacial gravel. Randolph is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, an area with a high <b>earthquake</b> <b>risk.</b> Between 1974 and 2004, forty-five earthquakes were recorded in a radius of [...] around the settlement. Located in the humid subtropical climate zone, the climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and chilly to mild winters.|$|E
30|$|Poor seismic {{response}} of buildings and civil structures {{is the major}} contributing factor for the extensive casualties, damages and destructions associated with earthquakes and other seismic occurrences (Bilham 2009; Fernandez 2014). Hence, contemporary studies have been geared towards improving the dynamic {{response of}} building when {{under the influence of}} sudden external loads which arise in the event of earthquakes and other seismic events. In Africa, there is substantial evidence of mitigation strategies to reduce <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> in form of codes and regulations which have been established by governments of countries prone to seismic activities. However, there are several records of economic losses and human losses in earthquake events despite the existence of these regulations. This suggests that the existing regulations are not effective for the purpose of reducing <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks.</b> It is thus expedient to investigate the reason for the ineffectiveness of these regulations.|$|R

2500|$|At {{that time}} Wellington's Sacred Heart Basilica was under {{construction}} with Petre as architect in a branch office there. It {{is likely that}} it was in Wellington that Grimes invited Petre to submit a plan for the Christchurch Cathedral. Petre proposed the form of the Cathedral.

In fact if a Gothic church were drawn with the width of nave shown in my drawings it would be higher than any Gothic church in the world." [...] Gothic was also considered the greater <b>earthquake</b> <b>risk</b> and overall the more expensive. Grimes had the old church removed to Ferry Road and construction of a new cathedral began in 1901.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} natural disaster risk {{in the context of}} megacities generally, and Asian megacities particularly. A key gap in approaches to managing megacity risk has been attention to the financial aspects, for which interest has lately been emerging in terms of exploring whether such risk may be suitable for a donor-assisted regional Asian risk pooling scheme. One suggestion concerns insuring public sector liabilities in terms of infrastructure replacement funding, liquidity support and relief to the population. Recently, this was operationalized in the Caribbean regional pooling of hurricane and <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks,</b> and by the Mexican government for <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks.</b> In both cases, central governments are the actors. We assess the rationale and applicability of such deliberations given the dynamic nature of vulnerability and risk, and discuss conditions for conducting similar transactions for Asian megacity risks. Overall, given our adopted criteria, we tentatively conclude that there may indeed be a case for risk pooling, yet the dynamics of assessing formal and informal risks as well as the specificity of conditions in respective megacities pose important hurdles that have to be overcome...|$|R
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, concrete is {{very strong}} in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute {{one of the largest}} <b>earthquake</b> <b>risks</b> globally. These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey).|$|R
