Their caskets were disinterred and their remains burned, along with copies of their books. On 22 July 1560, Elizabeth I {{formally}} rehabilitated both reformers.

5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted the abbey to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of the abbey stone was then {{used to create a}} new mansion on the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} French troops helped stiffen {{resistance}} to the English, who abandoned Haddington in September 1549 and, {{after the fall of}} Protector Somerset in England, withdrew from Scotland completely. From 1554, Marie of Guise formally took over the regency, maintaining a difficult position, partly by giving limited toleration to Protestant dissent and attempting to diffuse resentment over the continued presence of French troops. When the Protestant Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and asked for English military support to expel the French. The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in Leith, which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the Treaty of Edinburgh, leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the ascendant.|$|E
5|$|When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to {{the throne}} there were changes in the {{leadership}} on the Isle of Wight and the castle. Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 {{for his role in}} the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen. When the Protestant Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1558, however, peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England. Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle. Worsley filled in half of the castle's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea, and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner's House on the other side of the castle. Nonetheless, an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition. Work costing £50 was done in 1587, including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns. The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada, after which further repairs were carried out on the castle. By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle, which was still considered an important defence for the Solent, needed expensive repairs.|$|E

Scottish and English interests were re-aligned and naval conflict subsided.|$|E

25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry.

John of Montecorvino was a key missionary to Mongol-controlled China during the Yuan Dynasty, translating the New Testament and the Psalms into the Mongol tongue, founding the first Roman Catholic mission in Beijing and becoming its first bishop.|$|E

That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Álvaro <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne during another contest {{over the}} throne in 1568. Being from the Kwilu river valley {{and not a}} blood {{relative}} {{of any of the}} previous kings, his reign {{marked the beginning of the}} House of Kwilu. There were certainly factions that opposed him, though it is not known specifically who they were. Álvaro immediately had to fight invaders from the east (who some authorities believe were actually rebels within the country, either peasants or discontented nobles from rival factions) called the Jagas. To do this, he decided to enlist the aid of the Portuguese based at São Tomé, who sent an expedition under Francisco de Gouveia Sottomaior to assist. As a part of the same process, Álvaro agreed to allow the Portuguese to establish a colony in his province of Luanda south of his kingdom. In addition to allowing the Portuguese to establish themselves in Luanda, Kongo provided the Portuguese with support in their war against the Kingdom of Ndongo in 1579. The kingdom of Ndongo was located inland east of Luanda and although claimed in Kongo's royal titles as early as 1535 was probably never under a firm Kongo administration.|$|E
