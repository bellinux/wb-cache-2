25|$|A lean loose-jointed Negro had {{commenced}} plunking {{a guitar}} beside me while <b>I</b> <b>slept...</b> As he played, he pressed a knife on {{the strings of}} the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars....The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had ever heard.|$|E

60|$|Came {{steps and}} movements--steps openly advertised as {{suppressed}} {{with the intent}} of silence and that yet were deliberately noisy with the secret intent of rousing me if <b>I</b> still <b>slept.</b> <b>I</b> smiled inwardly at the rascal's trick.|$|R

500|$|The group {{finale of}} [...] "Don't Stop" [...] {{received}} good grades—"A" [...] from Gonzales and [...] "B+" [...] from Benigno, {{and four of}} five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a bright spot in that Sam got to sing a solo. The performance received encomiums such as [...] "pretty great" [...] from Semigran and [...] "inspired" [...] from Futterman. The portion of an original song for the April Rhodes musical sung by April and Will, [...] "Nice to Meet You, Have <b>I</b> <b>Slept</b> with You?", received little commentary, though Flandez made specific mention of [...] "her operatic range, and their charismatic stage presence".|$|E

6000|$|... "If you have, my dear Woods, {{there has}} been a strong sympathy between us; <b>I</b> have {{scarcely}} <b>slept.</b> <b>I</b> may say I have thought of nothing else, myself, and am glad you have broached the subject, again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Inquired on her 90th {{birthday}} of her having any regret in life, she replied, [...] "Yes, {{all the men}} <b>I</b> never <b>slept</b> with. Imagine!" ...|$|R
500|$|All six {{songs from}} Rumours {{covered in the}} episode were {{released}} as singles, available for digital download. Chenoweth and Morrison were featured on [...] "Dreams", McHale sang [...] "Never Going Back Again", Rivera covered [...] "Songbird", Monteith and Agron duetted on [...] "I Don't Want to Know", Michele sang [...] "Go Your Own Way", and the glee club combined on [...] "Don't Stop". The episode also included a portion of an original song, [...] "Nice to Meet You, Have <b>I</b> <b>Slept</b> with You?"—written by Brennan and Adam Anders and sung by Chenoweth and Morrison—which was not released. [...] "The Chain", also from Rumours, was used as backing music in the second motel stakeout scene.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> with a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Atchison revealed that he slept through most of the day of his alleged presidency: [...] "There had been three or four busy nights finishing up the work of the Senate, and <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> most of that Sunday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's all, mother. I {{should say}} I had dreamt, it, if <b>I</b> had <b>slept</b> any last night; but I guess it really happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reduced! I've been on {{the verge}} of the grave. <b>I</b> haven't <b>slept</b> six hours for three weeks." [...] This was said with great gravity.|$|R
60|$|The {{fireplaces}} in {{my house}} will be many and large. Small fires and cold weather mean hermetically-sealed rooms and a jealous cherishing of heated and filth-laden air. With large fire-places and generous heat, some windows may be open all the time, and without hardship all the windows can be opened every little while and the rooms flushed with clean pure air. I have nearly died in the stagnant, rotten air of other people's houses--especially in the Eastern states. In Maine <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> {{in a room with}} storm-windows immovable, and with one small pane five inches by six, that could be opened. Did <b>I</b> say <b>slept?</b> <b>I</b> panted with my mouth in the opening and blasphemed till I ruined all my chances of heaven.|$|R
2500|$|After first {{living with}} her uncle Akira, Mazie, Roy and her mother moved into a rooming house on Kewalo Street in Honolulu. [...] "The first place had one room, one table, three chairs and one bed," [...] Laura said. [...] "Mazie and Roy slept on the bed. <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> {{on the floor with}} a futon. The landlady was so nice. The rent was $35, but she charged us less because I didn't have a job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first day}} of Abe's trial was November 25, 1936, and by 5a.m. crowds were already {{gathering}} to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused {{by some of the}} details involved in the case, yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, [...] "The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert... There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> {{badly and}} <b>I</b> {{want to get}} some air," [...] {{answered}} Beatrice, starting and colouring; [...] "I suppose that it was the storm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> pretty well, but {{in spite}} of the two {{blankets}} under us it was awfully hard, and I feel stiff all over now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{confound}} it! You don't mean to {{say that}} <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> for over five hours? Why didn't you wake me, Dias?" [...] he asked angrily.|$|R
2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and <b>I</b> <b>slept.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On {{a website}} {{registered}} in his name, Sodini chronicled over a nine-month period his rejections by women, his involuntary celibacy and his severe sexual frustration. [...] "Who knows why? I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)," [...] he writes. [...] "Last time <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> {{all night with}} a girlfriend it was 1982. Girls and women don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE." [...] About his problems with women, he wrote: [...] "Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one." [...] In 2008, Sodini posted online videos, in which he discusses his emotions, along with a tour of his home, the latter which was a homework assignment from [...] "a self-help seminar [...] had attended on how to date women".|$|E
2500|$|Brennan {{turned down}} the {{internship}} and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her [...] "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" [...] and [...] "I am never going to help you." [...] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy {{for as long as}} she could, living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs [...] "started to seed people with the notion that <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." [...] A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm and she accepted the offer. When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.|$|E
6000|$|... "Back to my rooms," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{shall have}} a pipe {{and go to}} bed. <b>I</b> haven't <b>slept</b> well lately. To-night I think I shall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{something}} of the sort. But I'm not going to argue these points. Do you know why <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> two hundred years? To fly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To say the truth, <b>I</b> have <b>slept</b> so soundly,' said Lord George, {{rubbing his}} eyes and looking round the room, 'that I don't {{remember}} quite--what place is this?' ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 1871, he was {{appointed}} British representative on the international commission to maintain the navigation of {{the mouth of the}} River Danube, with headquarters at Galatz. Gordon was bored with the work of the Danube commission, and spent as much time as possible exploring the Romanian countryside whose beauty enchanted Gordon when he was not making visits to Bucharest to meet up with his old friend Romolo Gessi who was living there at the time. During his second trip to Romania, Gordon insisted on living with ordinary people as he traveled over the countryside, commenting that Romanian peasants [...] "live like animals with no fuel, but reeds", and spent one night at the home of a poor Jewish craftsman whom Gordon praised for his kindness sharing the single bedroom with his host, his wife and their seven children. Gordon seemed pleased by his simple lifestyle, writing in a letter that: [...] "One night, <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> better than I have for a long time, by a fire in a fisherman's hut".|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. And when I asked him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>slept.</b> Through countless generations <b>I</b> <b>slept</b> on and at my {{side was}} the one child of my body that was left to me. What chanced to my spirit and to hers during that sleep, thou knowest alone, but doubtless they went forth to work thy ends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} that's settled," [...] was Miss West's exclamation this morning, {{when we met}} on the poop {{and after}} I had told her how gloriously <b>I</b> had <b>slept.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We live at Cheltenham," [...] said Florence, [...] "and {{that is not}} at {{all like}} Paris. Indeed, <b>I</b> never <b>slept</b> but two nights at Paris in my life." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may have}} been ten o'clock on the {{following}} morning, or a little past it, when the Shaman Simbri came into my room and asked me how <b>I</b> had <b>slept.</b>|$|R
