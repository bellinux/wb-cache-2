5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) grow as a drupe that <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cashew apple, {{the fruit}} of the cashew tree. Native to northeastern Brazil, the cashew was {{introduced}} to India and East Africa in the sixteenth century, where they remain a major commercial crop. The nut must be roasted to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum quadrifidum {{is readily}} {{confused}} with G.fornicatum, which is larger—up to —and has smaller spores (4–5μm in diameter). Geastrum minimum, although small like G.quadrifidum, is distinguished by having more rays (usually more than seven), {{and it is}} not fornicate. Also, its mycelial layer <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fibrous layer for a long time, without forming a mycelial cup like G.quadrifidum. The Chilean species G.jurei does not have a clearly demarcated peristome.|$|E
5|$|In {{amino acids}} {{that have a}} carbon chain {{attached}} to the α–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on. In some amino acids, the amine group <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, Alexandretta <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> State of Aleppo, and in 1925, it <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{combined}} State of Syria, {{still with}} special administrative status.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{creation}} of arrondissements in 1800 Arcis became the capital {{of one of them}} but this was abolished in 1926. The cantons of Arcis-sur-Aube and Ramerupt <b>are</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arrondissement of Troyes; the Canton of Méry-sur-Seine <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arrondissement of Nogent-sur-Seine, and the Canton of Chavanges <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arrondissement of Bar-sur-Aube. This was effective from 1801: 4 cantons and 93 communes.|$|R
50|$|Each booster <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{external}} tank at the SRB's aft frame by two lateral {{sway braces}} and a diagonal attachment. The forward {{end of each}} SRB <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> external tank at the forward end of the SRB's forward skirt. On the launch pad, each booster also <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mobile launcher platform at the aft skirt by four frangible nuts that were severed at lift-off.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dorsal {{wall of the}} hemocoel. It has paired inlets or ostia at intervals down its length, and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquin Round Table, {{as well as}} {{the number}} of other {{literary}} and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA. The organization's bronze plaque <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the hotel.|$|E

5|$|The President of the Republic may {{announce}} {{a period of}} national mourning. During that time Polish flags are flown at half-staff. If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast, a black ribbon <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pole {{as a sign of}} mourning or a black flag is flown to its left from the national flag.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The reed <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{mouthpiece}} by the ligature, {{and the top}} half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth. In {{the past}} clarinetists used to wrap a string around the mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation of the mouth around the mouthpiece and reed is called the embouchure.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of October 2014, <b>the</b> cockpit <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The rear {{carry-through}} spar <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuselage shortly after Thanksgiving 2014. At the beginning of May 2015, <b>the</b> strakes <b>were</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airframe. The last major component, the wings, {{were expected to be}} delivered in late 2015. In January 2016 XCOR's CEO Jay Gibson said [...] "...we anticipate <b>the</b> wings <b>to</b> be there in the very near future..." [...] and the CTO Michael Valant said they were finding that calibrating the flaps was a challenge. In February 2016 the first prototype was described as a [...] "wingless shell." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{restored}} between June 2015 and June 2016 by the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure. The lion relief, puring water, {{that is part}} of the water-trough (which <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fountain) has eroded over the years and was replaced with a replica in 2016. The interior consists of a spiral staircase which was also restored in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey Master's Tower was the {{original}} access to the College from the river. A single-storey structure <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south side. The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses. Poste records that in 1847 it stood between two barns, neither of which now remain. It consists of a pointed arch for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by buttress walls on each side.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{versions}} of its manuscripts are known. One has fifteen verses but attached to Atharvaveda, while another very different and augmented manuscript {{exists in the}} Telugu language which has one hundred and forty two verses and <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Krishna Yajurveda. The text is notable for describing Yoga in the Vaishnavism tradition.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to housing {{the rental car}} facilities, a six-story parking garage (which <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terminal) provides long-term and short-term parking. Lower cost satellite parking options, with continuous free shuttle service, {{can be found in}} the Blue, Red and Green parking lots along International Gateway. The Blue lot is the closest to the terminal and also offers some covered parking. The cost of parking a car in the blue lot is $9 per 24 hours. The Red Lot costs $7 per 24 hours and the green lost costs $5 per 24 hours to park.The Green lot is the furthest away from the terminal. Additionally, there is a free cell phone lot accessed from the outbound side of International Gateway.|$|E
5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, {{the fact that a}} nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E

5|$|The Black Stone <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east {{corner of}} the Kaaba, known as al-Rukn al-Aswad (the Corner of the Stone). Another stone, known as the Hajar as-Sa’adah (Stone of Felicity) is set into the Kaaba's {{opposite}} corner, al-Rukn al-Yamani (the Yemeni Corner), at a somewhat lower height than the Black Stone. The choice of the east corner may have had ritual significance; it faces the rain-bringing east wind (al-qabul) and the direction from which Canopus rises.|$|E
5|$|The J. W. Long Law Library has 296,000 volumes and {{microform}} equivalents, {{which include}} {{both state and}} federal primary law sources, as well as treatises, periodicals and other secondary legal sources. The three-story structure <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Collins Legal Center and contains study rooms, video rooms, conference rooms, and computer labs, and it is staffed by reference librarians. Additionally, it has special collections in tax law, public international law, and labor law, {{and it is a}} Selective Federal Government Documents Depository. Members of the public may access the library when the library is staffed by librarians. Law students also have access to Willamette University's Mark O. Hatfield Library, the Oregon Supreme Court Law Library, the Oregon State Library, and the Oregon State Archives.|$|E
5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both convey the same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
