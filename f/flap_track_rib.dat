50|$|During the 1930s and 1940s {{the stadium}} ran mixed {{meetings}} where the greyhound races were supplemented by whippet racing. Joe Grant purchased an extra {{one and a}} half acres in 1947 and the track was extended. A McWhiter hare system was installed and the track established itself as one of the leading <b>flapping</b> <b>tracks</b> in the country. Flapping was the nickname given to independent tracks.|$|R
50|$|Modern jet {{aircraft}} use supercritical airfoils which decrease wave drag significantly. Further optimization {{can be achieved}} through careful design of wing body fairings, engine nacelles, <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings, and wingtip fuel tanks. Due to the prevalence of supercritical airfoils, other design features with {{the sole purpose of}} minimizing wave drag (such as the anti-shock bodies on the Convair 990) are rare in modern aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{greyhound}} racing was independent (not affiliated {{to the sports}} governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and {{was known as a}} <b>flapping</b> <b>track</b> which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track circumference was 437 yards and the race distances were 325, 482, 525 and 762 yards with the main events being the Newton Abbot Derby and Newton Abbot St Leger. Facilities included five on-course bookmakers and a forecast only primitive ticket machine totalisator.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century the Myrtle Grove sports ground was built and used by the Walthamstow Grange Football Club from 1908. By 1929 the ground hosted {{greyhound}} racing for the first time and was known as the Crooked Billet Greyhound and whippet track; this was an independent track (unaffiliated to a governing body).In 1931 man called William Chandler, a bookmaker by trade, decided to build on the existing <b>flapping</b> <b>track</b> (nickname for independents). Chandler also had shares in the Hackney Wick Stadium.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>track</b> {{remained}} a <b>flapping</b> <b>track</b> (not {{licensed by the}} National Greyhound Racing Club) for thirty five years; boxing events and trotting was also seen at the stadium that was owned by Benjamin Lovatt at the time. Distances changed to 350 and 600 yards and meetings took place on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. [...] The stadium was reportedly sold in 1976 but plans to upgrade the track ended with the stadium closing in 1978 and the site remained derelict for a further thirteen years.|$|R
5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of the NASA AFC-Enabled Simplified High-Lift System Integration Study contract (NNL 10 AA 05 B) performed by Boeing under the Fixed Wing Project. This task is motivated by the simplified high-lift system, which is advantageous due to the simpler mechanical system, reduced actuation power and lower maintenance costs. Additionally, the removal of the <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings associated with conventional high-lift systems renders a more efficient aerodynamic configuration. Potentially, these benefits translate to a approx. 2. 25 % net reduction in fuel burn for a twin-engine, long-range airplane...|$|R
5000|$|Most jet airliners have a {{cruising}} speed between Mach 0.8 and 0.85. For aircraft {{operating in the}} transonic regime (about Mach 0.8-1.2), wave drag can be minimized by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly {{along the length of}} the aircraft. This is known as the area rule. On subsonic aircraft such as jet airliners, this can be achieved by the addition of smooth pods on the trailing edges of the wings. These pods are known as anti-shock bodies, Küchemann Carrots, or <b>flap</b> <b>track</b> fairings, as they enclose the mechanisms for deploying the wing flaps.|$|R
