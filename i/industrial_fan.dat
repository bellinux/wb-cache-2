5000|$|The myth of {{decapitation}} by {{jumping into}} a ceiling fan has two versions, {{both of which}} were tested: jumping up into the blades from below (via a kid jumping up and down on a bed) and jumping forward so as to carry the neck into the blades from the side (the so-called [...] "lover's leap".) To test this, Kari and Scottie bought a regular house fan and also an <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> (with a higher top speed and metal blades as opposed to wood), and then they and Tori encased pig spines and latex arteries filled with fake blood inside busts of Adam and added human craniums. They then added rigs for both scenarios.|$|E
50|$|All <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> designs must be {{accurately}} {{engineered to}} meet performance specifications while maintaining structural integrity. For each application, there are specific flow and pressure requirements. Depending on the application, the fan {{may be subject}} to high rotating speeds, an operating environment with corrosive chemicals or abrasive air streams, and extreme temperatures. Larger fans and higher speeds produce greater forces on the rotating structures; for safety and reliability, the design must eliminate excessive stresses and excitable resonant frequencies. Computer modeling programs for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) are often employed in the design process, in addition to laboratory scale model testing. Even after the fan is built the verification might continue, using fan performance testing for flow and pressure, strain gage testing for stresses and tests to record the fan's resonant frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial or <b>industrial</b> ceiling <b>fans</b> {{are usually}} used in offices, {{factories}} or industries. Commercial ceiling fans {{are designed to}} be more cost effective and more energy efficient then other cooling alternatives. The industrial or commercial ceiling fans usually use three blades and operate with a high-speed motor. Some can be found with more than 3 blades though. These energy efficient ceiling fans usually push massive amounts of air compared to other ceiling fan types. In the 1980s, it was common to find metal-bladed <b>industrial</b> ceiling <b>fans</b> in American households, while <b>industrial</b> <b>fans</b> in household applications are still commonplace today in Middle-Eastern households.|$|R

50|$|As Jamaica Plain {{became a}} part of Boston, the rate of growth {{continued}} to increase. The triple decker house, a defining image in urban New England architecture, first showed up in the 1870s, and spread rapidly in the 1890s. In Jamaica Plain, the first commercial blocks were built in the 1870s, with the first brick commercial building erected in 1875. In 1873, the imposing brick police station was built on Seavern's Avenue, and a year later the recently built Eliot School was renamed West Roxbury High School, only to be changed to Jamaica Plain High School after annexation. The Stony Brook valley had long been the industrial center of Jamaica Plain. In 1871, the Haffenreffer brewery opened near Boylston and Amory Streets, taking advantage of the Stony Brook aquifer and the presence of German immigrants in the area. The same year, the Boylston Schul Verein opened just across the railroad tracks, one of many organizations that served German residents in the neighborhood. To the south, the B.F. Sturtevant Company opened an <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> factory in 1878 along the railroad tracks between Williams and Green Street, which grew to employ 500 employees.

5000|$|They busted {{the myth}} in both {{scenarios}} with both household and industrial fans, as tests proved that residential ceiling fans are, apparently by design, largely incapable of causing more than minor injury, having low-torque motors that stop quickly when blocked and blades composed of light materials that tend to break easily if impacted at speed (the household fan test of the [...] "lover's leap" [...] scenario actually broke the fan blades.) They did find that industrial fans, with their steel blades and higher speeds, proved capable of causing injury and laceration - building codes require industrial fans to be mounted with blades 10 feet above the floor, and the <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> test of the [...] "lover's leap" [...] scenario produced a lethal injury where the fan sliced through the jugular and into the vertebrae - but still lost energy rapidly once blocked and were unable to decapitate the test dummy. As a finale, Scottie, Tory and Kari created an even more dangerous fan with a lawn mower engine as the fan motor and razor sharp blades made from sheet metal {{in an attempt to}} duplicate the result, and even it was unable to achieve decapitation, but it caused lethal and horrifying injuries that compelled Adam to put it into the [...] "MythBusters Hall of Fame." ...|$|E

40|$|Application of {{computational}} {{methods to}} <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> design processes has progressed steadily {{over the past}} decade. The reducing cost of the computer hardware upon which codes run has brought the hardware within the reach of all <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> designers. However, the cost of commercially available codes remains high. Open source codes provide <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> designers with an alternative. The finite volume open-source solver OpenFOAM {{has been used by}} scholars to predict the performance of industrial centrifugal fans incorporating impeller blades constructed from cambered plate, but not by <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> designers. This paper presents a modelling approach which we developed for application as part of an <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> manufacturers order related design process. We compare numerical performance predictions with experimental results both at peak pressure and at peak efficiency conditions.

40|$|Stall-induced {{vibration}} places fundamental {{limitations on}} <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> performance and remains a persistent {{problem in the}} development of industrial fans and compressors. In this paper, we present an experimental programme that utilised two strategies to study rotating stall recovery patterns in an <b>industrial</b> <b>fan.</b> The experimental facility incorporated a fan with both variable pitch in motion blades and a variable speed drive. The facility enabled us first, to study the evolution of unsteady pressure signals on the fan casing whilst varying fan blade pitch and then to examine varying fan rotational speed. Consequently, we were able to recover a fan from stall either by varying blade pitch at constant speed, or by varying speed at constant blade pitch. We also studied the physical flow phenomena associated with stall recovery by cross-correlating signals from circumferentially offset high frequency response pressure transducers and then analysed the cross-spectra. This enabled us to gain insight into the transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery in the studied <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> class. The transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery by varying blade pitch was indicative of both a mild and progressive transition. In contrast, stall recovery by varying fan speed occurred more suddenly. In comparison with the variable pitch transition, the variable speed transition was more indicative of recovery from mild surge. From this we may conclude that stall recovery via variable speed resulted in significantly higher unsteady mechanical stress induced in fan rotating components than recovery via variable pitch. Higher bending stresses in the fan blades are more likely to result in mechanical failure, and therefore we may conclude that the studied fan is more ‘stall tolerant’ when one operates it as a variable pitch fan rather than as a variable speed fan...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{modelling}} {{and interpretation}} advances of <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> stall phenomena, related stall detection methods, and control technologies. Competing theories have helped engineers refine fan stability and control technology. With {{the development of}} these theories, three major issues have emerged. In this paper, we first consider the interplay between aerodynamic perturbations and instability inception. An understanding of the key physical phenomena that occurs with stall inception is critical to alleviate stall by design or through active or passive control methods. We then review the use of passive and active control strategies to improve fan stability. Whilst historically compressor design engineers have used passive control techniques, recent technologies have prompted them to install high-response stall detection and control systems that provide <b>industrial</b> <b>fan</b> designers with new insight into how they may detect and control stall. Finally, the paper reviews the methods and prospects for early stall detection to complement control systems with a warning capability. Engineers may use an effective real-time stall warning system to extend a fan’s operating range by allowing it to operate safely at a reduced stall margin. This may also enable the fan to operate in service at a more efficient point on its characteristic...|$|E
