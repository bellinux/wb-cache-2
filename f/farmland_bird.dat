5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000â€“1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of agricultural intensity, various farming practices, landscape composition and vegetation cover on the abundance and species richness of wintering <b>farmland</b> <b>birds,</b> assessed simultaneously across seven European regions. The abundance and species richness of wintering <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> were negatively affected by agricultural intensity. The effects of yield and farm type were interlinked. Of the 10 farming practices assessed, mechanical weeding and the amount of organic fertilizer applied negatively affected <b>farmland</b> <b>birds,</b> presumably due to reduced food availability on arable fields. Positive effects of organic farming on <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> proved to be limited to simplified landscapes. More <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> were observed in areas with more stubble, pasture and green manure crops. Species richness was higher in areas with more pasture. The results of this study show that farm management, vegetation cover and landscape composition all influence wintering <b>farmland</b> <b>birds.</b> Heterogeneous landscapes comprising arable crops as well as grasslands support most species of <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> in winter.

40|$|To {{address the}} decline in <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> across {{agricultural}} landscapes a key approach under agri-environment schemes has been the widespread creation of perennial grass-only buffer strips along field boundaries. However, despite a high dependency on these strips to enhance biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, it appears that benefits for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> during the breeding season have been limited. We investigated the provision of plant and invertebrate resources for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> in buffer strips that were established with three different seed mixes, including the standard grass-only habitat. We hypothesised that resource provision would differ between seed mix types {{due to differences in}} original composition. We also investigated three different types of management aimed at influencing sward composition and habitat structure, namely cutting, scarification and the application of graminicide. These approaches were used to influence the accessibility of structurally complex swards to <b>farmland</b> <b>birds.</b> We hypothesised that the abundance of plant and invertebrate resources and access to these resources would be directly related to management type. The abundance of plant resources and sward structure were determined using quadrats and the drop disc method respectively, whilst the invertebrates were assessed using suction sampling. The study demonstrated the value of including forbs (herbaceous plant species) in seed mixes used to establish buffer strips by increasing plant resources for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds,</b> although this was not coupled with an increase in beetle abundance and mass. However, grass-only buffer strips managed with annual cutting were shown to provide similar levels of invertebrate resources to <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> as with the more complex seed mixes, but it is likely that access to these resources was restricted by tall homogenous swards and a limited amount of bare ground. The study demonstrated that novel buffer strip management techniques can strongly influence both the resource abundance and resource access by <b>farmland</b> <b>birds.</b> Scarification in particular was shown to be highly effective at opening up the sward to increase access by <b>farmland</b> <b>birds,</b> but was associated with a reduction in plant resources. Given the financial barriers for the use of seed mixes that contain forbs to establish buffer strips, importantly the study has shown that the value of existing grass-only buffer strips for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> can be enhanced through the use of scarification. Consequently, as an alternative to annual cutting, we recommend that scarification is periodically applied to narrow (1 - 3 m) strips next to the crop edge to enhance the value of grass-only buffer strips for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds...</b>|$|R

The quantification of phenological processes {{is very important}} for understanding ecosystems and ecological development. Such factors determine population growth and influence species-species interactions (competition, predation, reproduction) and species distribution. Birds have long been used to provide early warning of environmental problems, because they are the best known and documented major taxonomic group, especially in terms of the sizes and trends of populations and distributions. Common <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> are in decline throughout Europe, with the cumulative populations of all 33 species of <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> suffering a decline of 44 per cent between 1980 and 2005. For the link between vegetation dynamics and <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> distribution phenological indices and their spatial statistical characteristics were calculated from the time series of the SPOT Vegetation images. The <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> species data were selected from the European Bird Census Counsel (EBCC) Atlas of European breeding birds.

The study shows that this stratification is very appropriate to describe the spatial distribution of <b>farmland</b> <b>birds.</b> Furthermore it was shown that phenological indicators, especially the start of the growing season, the first greening up measures and the productivity measures are good indicators of the distribution of the European <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> and that these indicators are comparable to climatic measures.

The benefits of low input barley systems were also investigated; barley fields were subjected to two separate herbicide sub-treatments on a split-field design (high input broad-spectrum or low input narrow spectrum herbicides). The abundance of plant resources and invertebrates was assessed for three growing seasons during summer and winter for each crop type. The study clearly demonstrated the value of spring barley {{for the provision of}} plant resources when compared to the other silage cropping systems, whilst invertebrate responses were variable. No differences in plant and invertebrate resources were found between the barley treatments. Throughout the year, forage maize afforded the lowest provision of resources for <b>farmland</b> <b>birds,</b> and because it is likely that maize will continue to be grown in pastoral areas, the value of this habitat needs to be improved if <b>farmland</b> <b>birds</b> are to benefit.

The combination of agricultural intensification, especially after the U.

40|$|Recent {{population}} declines of seed-eating farmland {{birds have}} been associated with reduced overwinter survival due to reductions in food supply. An important component of predicting how food shortages will affect animal populations is to measure the functional response, i. e. the relationship between food density and feeding rate, over the range of environmental conditions experienced by foraging animals. Crop stubble fields are an important foraging habitat for many species of seed-eating <b>farmland</b> <b>bird.</b> However, some important questions remain regarding <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> foraging behaviour in this habitat, and in particular the effect of stubble on <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> functional responses is unknown. We measured the functional responses of a seed-eating passerine, the Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, consuming seeds placed on the substrate surface in three different treatments: bare soil, low density stubble and high density stubble. Stubble presence significantly reduced feeding rates, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two stubble treatments. Stubble reduced feeding rates by reducing the maximum attack distance, i. e. the distance over which an individual food item is targeted and consumed. The searching speed, handling time per seed, proportion of time spent vigilant, duration of vigilance bouts and duration of head-down search periods were unaffected by the presence of stubble. The frequency of vigilance bouts was higher in the bare soil treatment, but this is likely to be a consequence of the increased feeding rate.

It is often difficult to measure the functional response of farmland birds directly, but {{it may be possible to}} measure behavioural parameters more quickly. We performed experiments in which rooks fed on a range of artificial food densities in two grass sward heights. Food detection distance was greater in the shorter sward, but sward height did not influence searching speed or handling time. The functional response could be accurately predicted in both sward heights. We show that the functional response of a <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> can be predicted from parameters that can be measured more quickly than the alternative of measuring the functional response directly.

40|$|Many <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> species across Europe have {{continued}} to show population declines since the 1970 s, {{as a result of}} agricultural intensification. A large number of conservation schemes and initiatives have emerged from Government and the food industry sector to address this problem. Some <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> populations are limited by overwintering survival. This paper compares winter <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> abundance and species richness from differing conservation schemes, including: Entry Level Stewardship (ELS), Conservation Grade (CG) and Organic farm management scenarios. Winter bird surveys were tailored to the farm-scale, reflecting the proportions of infield habitat arrangements of nine case study farms. Organic farms provided significantly less infield habitat types across all schemes and were dominated by grassland habitat. Entry Level Stewardship and CG schemes had larger proportions of winter bird food provisions and increased habitat heterogeneity. The results show granivorous passerines to be significantly more abundant on CG farms compared to Organic. Moreover, yellowhammers (Emberiza citronella L.) are specialist seed-eaters that were significantly less abundant on Organic farms, compared to ELS and CG. There were no significant differences for insectivorous passerines between schemes. A positive relationship between number of infield habitats and species richness on farms was found, with Organic farms scoring the lowest species richness. These results demonstrate a proof-of-concept that farm-scale management can have positive farm-scale effects for birds; with increasing habitat heterogeneity and the presence of winter bird food provisions. Interestingly, Organic farms are shown not to provide significant benefits to overwintering birds.

40|$|Many <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> {{species have}} {{declined}} rapidly throughout Europe {{during the last}} 30 years and studies, mainly from the UK, suggest that these declines {{have been caused by}} agricultural intensification. However, since the conditions for farming vary considerably across Europe, the underlying causes of the population declines may also vary. The rate of agricultural intensification has been less dramatic since the mid 1970 s in Sweden than in south-western Europe. Still, I show that population trends of farmland birds have declined at least as much in Sweden as in England between 1976 and 2001. Separating population trends in three Swedish landscape types with different patterns of agricultural change showed that the declines were most pronounced in the open plains characterised by intensification and in the forest farmland landscapes characterised by extensification or abandonment. Thus, the observed strong decline of farmland birds in Sweden was probably caused by the dual negative effects of intensification in productive regions and abandonment in marginal farmland. Several species displayed great temporal similarities in population trends within regions in Sweden and in comparison to England. These between population similarities may have been caused by large-scale effects of changing agricultural policies, as <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> population trend shifts were closely linked to agricultural policy shifts in Sweden and western Europe. However, {{it is also possible that}} reduced survival at wintering grounds may have had an additional effect because it was especially species that shared European wintering grounds that displayed the strongest between population synchrony in trends. Several <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> populations decreased less or even increased during the set-aside policy period (1987 to 1995) when agricultural became less intensive. However, a repeated census of farmland birds between 1994 and 2004 suggested that a general reduction of farming intensity, e. g. by increasing area of set-aside, leys and cultivated pasture, mainly benefit farmland birds in farmland-dominated landscapes where such land-use is rare, whereas a reduced farming intensity was negative for species richness in forest-dominated landscapes. In contrast, in forest-dominated landscapes <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> species seemed to benefit from an increased area of cereal production. My results of landscapeâ€“dependent patterns of relationships between <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> population changes and changes in land-use highlights the importance of developing new region-specific agri-environmental schemes. The results also suggest that an effective way of changing the present negative trends of farmland birds is a broad change in agricultural policy to reverse the geographical polarisation of farming activities...|$|E
40|$|European <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> {{populations have}} {{decreased}} dramatically {{in recent decades}} and agricultural intensification {{has been identified as}} the main cause contributing to these declines. Identifying which specific intensification pressures are driving those population trends seems vital for bird conservation in European farmland. We investigated the response of ground-nesting farmland birds to the multivariate process of agricultural intensification in six European countries covering a bio-geographical and intensification gradient. Supported by PCA analysis, two groups of factors, related to field management and landscape modification, were considered, seeking to discriminate the relative importance of the effects of these main intensification components. Variance partition analysis showed that landscape factors accounted for most of the variation of ground-nesting <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> individual and breeding pair densities, as well as Skylark (i. e. our single model species) individual densities. In the case of Skylark breeders, field factors were found to be more important to explain their density. Our results suggest that in general <b>farmland</b> <b>bird</b> densities as well as Skylark densities are higher in simple landscapes dominated by agriculture, but with smaller fields and more different crops on the farms. In addition, high yields were negatively related to bird densities.
