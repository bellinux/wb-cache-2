Miranda explains that she didn't know any of that. Colin is later hanging out with Sal. Colin then asks Miranda {{if she wants to}} hang out. Miranda declines saying that her mom is sick. Later on, someone taps on her door which scares her because she doesn't know anyone that knocks like that. She looks though the peep hole [...] and sees Colin. She opens the door and <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> then kisses her. She then kisses him back. Colin smiles and then runs off.|$|E
2500|$|Tony helps Gabby {{when she}} is run over. Pickard {{revealed}} that [...] "It's {{love at first sight}} for Tony" [...] when sees Gabby. On how the characters meet, Oruche explained: [...] "She's walking down the street minding her own business. She comes across Tony, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and says something to her but she doesn't answer him. He thinks she's rude [...] She gets hit by a car [...] he then helps her. She's a woman lying in the gutter so he helps her. [...] he comes to the hospital to meet my children [...] Basically I have no help and I'm unconscious so he has to help me..." [...] Pickard added that Gabby asks him to look after her children, Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which he takes as an indication she may feel the same. Oruche explained that while her character is hospitalised Tony and Gabby are [...] "getting used to spending time with each other". Pickard revealed that Tony would become [...] "embroiled in the drama of [...] life". Tony discovers Gabby, like Tony, is married but [...] "like Tony, she's not happy". Pickard revealed that when Gabby's husband, Phil (Andonis Anthony), returns Gabby will be too scared to leave him for Tony. Oruche also spoke of Phil's return, saying that Gabby and Tony [...] "want to spend their lives together but like I said the husband comes back. She's not in any fit state to go through separating with somebody". Tony and Gabby have a brief relationship before she leaves Hollyoaks village.|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. Yes. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{pleading}} for credence, and then adds, simply) That {{was what was}} the matter with my collar.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> coldly. Worse, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she}} {{had been}} an utter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and, having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly. I may say, it's {{from him}} that I coppied MY look to Miss ----. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly {{and held out}} his arms. She gev a suffycating shreek, and rusht into his umbraces.|$|R
6000|$|... "Big Jim's" [...] wife gave <b>her</b> order. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with respect. She had {{mentioned}} truffles; {{and he had}} not known that she knew what truffles were. From the wine list she designated an appropriate and desirable brand. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with some admiration.|$|R
6000|$|STEVE. 'It was dense of {{me not to}} {{understand}} sooner--very dense.' <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with wistful eyes. 'Must I marry you, Miss Grey?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [He is aghast. He {{releases}} the AMAH. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with [...] horror. DAISY covers {{her face with}} her hands. The AMAH gives a [...] little snigger.|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] Where is she--holla! [...] [Calling to the Beggar, who returns; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> stedfastly.] [...] You are Idonea's Mother?-- [...] Nay, be not terrified--it does me good [...] To {{look upon}} you.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with slow-growing, uncomprehending surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> uncomprehendingly, {{seemingly}} {{failing to}} recognize her.|$|R
60|$|Helena began {{suddenly}} to laugh. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> inquiringly.|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. They {{why do you}} say so? [About {{to mutter}} [...] "She's an idiot!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{blushing}} face and panting figure, pats her on the shoulder and says] Never mind; don't be nervous.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (follows Miss Gilpin {{into the}} room. She {{leads him to}} the far end of the room near the door to the hall, after {{shutting}} the porch door carefully behind him. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> defiantly). Well? ...|$|E
60|$|RICHARD (quickly {{slipping}} {{down from the}} table with instinctive good manners). Your servant, madam: no offence. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> earnestly.) You deserve your reputation; but I'm sorry to see by your expression that you're a good woman.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fixedly. She {{returned}} his glance audaciously, steadfastly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with an artist's sudden, critical, {{estimating}} eye.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and smiled}} in {{recognition}} of her subterfuge.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; it's {{not merely}} that he's sorry. By the way <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> I know I'm not mistaken. I've wondered--what do you think, Leila. He's {{too old for}} her; but he seems an honourable, kind man." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very grieved, {{then turns}} and marches out, [...] {{followed}} by LADY DEDMOND, whose voice is heard without, answered [...] by his: [...] "What!" [...] In the doorway, as they pass, GEORGE is [...] standing; he comes in.|$|E
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--Stop! I say, Julia! [She returns, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{takes her}} hand.] Why do you dress {{yourself}} in this odd poky way? You {{used to be}} a very smartly dressed girl. Why do you hide your hair, and wear such a dowdy, high gown, Julia? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> thoughtfully for a moment, and {{his eyes}} twinkled.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> whimsically, {{and wiped}} the tears from his eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and {{his eyes}} were angry under knitted brows.|$|R
60|$|So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power {{this woman}} has to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's {{thoughts}} take such form as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze.|$|E
60|$|The woman reacts from him. For {{some time}} she will take no notice of him. But he waits, fixed. Then she comes near to him, and his will {{seems to take}} hold of her. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with a strange, proud, inhuman confidence, as if his {{influence}} with her was already accomplished.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON (gloating {{over the}} papers). Aha! That's right. That's right. (Before opening them <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and says) Excuse me. (He sees {{that she is}} hiding her face.) Very angry with me, eh? (He unties the packet, the seal of which is already broken, {{and puts it on}} the table to examine its contents.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and made}} a slight, sad gesture, {{indifferent}} also.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> clearly {{very anxious}} upon this {{question}} of fact.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> gravely, {{and without}} any sign of melting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{sitting at}} the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger. There's a way of doing it. She knew. I saw her working it. She was healthy-looking and plain dressed. She had her hair drawn back from her {{forehead}} and face--no curls or frizzes; that's the way she looked. Now I'll tell you the way they work the game; it's simple. When she wants a man, she manages it so that every time <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> he finds her looking at him. That's all.|$|E
6000|$|CLEOPATRA (her fears returning). Why {{do you say}} that, Caesar? Indeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything. You {{are wrong}} to treat me like this. (She stifles a sob.) I am only a child; and you turn into stone because you think some one has been killed. I cannot bear it. (She {{purposely}} breaks down and weeps. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with profound sadness and complete coldness. She {{looks up to see}} what effect she is producing. Seeing that he is unmoved, she sits up, pretending to struggle with her emotion and to put it bravely away.) But there: I know you hate tears: you shall not be troubled with them. I know you are not angry, but only sad; only I am so silly, I cannot help being hurt when you speak coldly. Of course you are quite right: it is dreadful to think of anyone being killed or even hurt; and I hope nothing really serious has-- (Her voice dies away under his contemptuous penetration.) ...|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. Hm! (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{takes up}} the packet and looks at it, pursing his lips and {{balancing}} it in his hand; looks at her again; passes the packet into {{his left hand and}} puts it behind his back, raising his right to scratch {{the back of his head}} as he turns and goes up to the edge of the vineyard, where he stands for a moment looking out into the vines, deep in thought. The Lady watches him in silence, somewhat slightingly. Suddenly he turns and comes back again, full of force and decision.) I grant your request, madame. Your courage and resolution deserve to succeed. Take the letters for which you have fought so well; and remember henceforth that you found the vile, vulgar Corsican adventurer as generous to the vanquished after the battle as he was resolute in the face of the enemy before it. (He offers her the packet.) ...|$|E
60|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with pitifully {{appealing}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she stopped}} short, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a little abruptly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> between {{pleading}} and shame. It {{seemed like}} deserting her.|$|R
