40|$|There {{were only}} few studies that the <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> {{strength}} involved in balance ability, posture and physical ability. However, {{it is still}} unknown {{that the relationship between}} <b>foot</b> fingers <b>grip</b> strength and injury in athletes. Present study purpose is {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>foot</b> fingers <b>grip</b> strength and injury history in high school rugby union players. 75 elite high school players participated in this study. The <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> strength was measured by new developed device (T. K. K. 3360 Takei Scientific Instruments Co.,Ltd). The injury history was corrected by questioner. The right-and-left difference of <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> strength was shown in injured group and healthy group significantly. In addition, the height, body mass and right-and-left difference of <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> strength was investigated a significant difference comparing with the upper body injured group and upper body healthy group. The measurement of <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> strength is very easy and effective test for athletes. This study suggested that the right-and-left difference of <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> strength relating with injury history. The right-and-left difference might be a big influence with movement, performance, traumatic injury and chronic injury. Therefore, it will be a necessary measurement for medical check for injury prevention and conditioning check...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the activities of the muscles around the ankle joint during <b>foot</b> <b>gripping.</b> [Subjects] The subjects of this study were 17 healthy females. [Methods] We measured the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) activities of the soleus muscle, the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle, and the tibialis anterior muscle, and calculated %IEMG during <b>foot</b> <b>gripping</b> in 3 different ankle joint posi-tions: 10 ° of plantar flexion, 0 °, and 10 ° of dorsiflexion. [Results] The maximal force of <b>foot</b> <b>gripping</b> achived by the crural muscles in any ankle position was 30 – 50 % IMEG of the MVC. Repeated analysis of variance showed that the %IEMG was significantly lower in 10 °of dorsiflexion than in the other 2 positions for all muscles. [Conclusion] These results suggested that the crural muscles help the ankle joint by co-contracting during <b>foot</b> <b>gripping.</b> Key words: Foot-gripping strength, Angle of the ankle joint, Muscle activit...|$|R

30|$|Gecko’s foot hairs exhibit {{significant}} frictional anisotropy {{that enables}} a strong <b>foot</b> <b>grip</b> {{in a specific}} direction and an easy detachment in the opposite direction. In this study, we fabricate adhesive devices with frictional anisotropy mimicking gecko’s foot hair based on oblique micro-beam arrays. The devices adhesion force is strongly anisotropic along the beam tilting direction and depends on the stress distribution at the contact area which, in turn, {{is affected by the}} geometry of the beam tips. This dependence is investigated by fabricating and testing micro beam arrays with various tip shapes.|$|R

He kicked out, and the next moment his ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled again, and tried to free his leg by kicking with the other. Then he realised he had the broken water-bottle at his hand, and, snatching it, he struggled into a sitting posture, and feeling in the darkness towards his <b>foot,</b> <b>gripped</b> a velvety ear, like the ear of a big cat. He had seized the water-bottle by its neck and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the strange beast. He repeated the blow, and then stabbed and jabbed with the jagged end of it, in the darkness, where he judged the face might be.|$|R

He treated the fish exactly as he would have treated a rat or duck: stood on it with one <b>foot,</b> <b>gripped</b> the long claws of the other through it, and tore it to pieces savagely, as one would a bit of paper. The beak was not used, except to receive the pieces, which were conveyed up to it by his foot, as a parrot eats. He devoured everything--fins, tail, skin, head, and most of the bones, in great hungry mouthfuls. Then he hopped {{to the top of the}} knoll, sat up straight, puffed out his feathers to look big, and went to sleep. But with the first slight movement I made to creep nearer, he was wide awake and flew to a higher point. Such hearing is simply marvelous.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Vapors {{were released}} in mid-2002, {{just before the}} World Cup of that year. The first glimpse anyone outside of Nike had of the boots was in the Nike cage advert starring Eric Cantona, Thierry Henry and Roberto Carlos, in which a close-up shot of the boots is taken {{near the end of}} the advert. The boot was first released in three colourways: cinder/white/maize; University Blue/white/obsidian; and medium grey/ red. These three colourways were distinctive as they had limited heel cushioning and dimples on the inner heel cup for <b>foot</b> <b>grip.</b> This was upgraded for the remainder of the Vapor I line. A chrome/lime variation (worn exclusively by Ronaldo in the semi-finals and final) was released to the public in limited numbers (just 4,600, across FG, HG and SG variants; quantity split unknown) in the period after the tournament. Other colours included white/ice/black; chrome/black; black/chilli red; dark charcoal/surf blue/white; and shock orange/white. In addition to the NikeSkin Vapors, Nike released its first kangaroo leather version of the shoe in black/grey. The Vapors also continued with the R9 designation on boots that was featured originally in the previous Mercurial lines. Both chrome colourways featured the [...] "R9" [...] brand.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of an enriched environment on {{the recovery of}} nerve function was studied after a sciatic nerve lesion and repair. A sciatic nerve gap of 15 mm was bridged in 12 rats using autologous nerve grafts. The rats were housed either in an enriched environment or in standard cages. In the enhanced housing environment, the rats were forced to move by dissociating food and water sources, including wire for <b>foot</b> <b>gripping</b> instead of flat plastic floors, and wooden play toys. Locomotor behavior was recorded on tape with a digital videorecorder and behavioral data were {{compared with those of}} a group of six unoperated rats. The video-recordings were analyzed for the stance factor (SF) as well as several other aspects of the rat's walking pattern. Walking was evaluated between 10 and 21 weeks after the operation. Differences in walking behavior between rats raised in an enriched environment and rats raised in standard cages could not be demonstrated. Differences in walking behavior between male and female rats were not found either. But data differed significantly at all ages with rats of the control group. Automutilation of parts of the denervated foot revealed a significant difference in both experimental groups, occurring less often in the enriched environment group. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a granivore {{and adapted}} for {{the consumption of}} seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and agile <b>feet</b> to <b>grip</b> the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|R
40|$|Background: Prospective {{studies in}} the general {{population}} show that slow gait speed is associated with cognitive decline and clinical progression to dementia. However, longitudinal studies in memory clinic populations are mostly lacking. We aimed to study the association between gait speed and grip strength and cognitive functioning at baseline and cognitive decline over time in memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Methods: We included 309 patients (age 70 +/- 9 years, 108 [35 %] women, Mini-Mental State Examination 27 +/- 3 points). Baseline gait speed was assessed over 15 <b>feet,</b> <b>grip</b> strength with a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Cognitive functioning was assessed annually with a comprehensive test battery during 3 years. Results: Age- and gender-adjusted linear mixed models showed that slower gait speed was related to worse baseline attention, memory, information processing speed, and verbal fluency. Longitudinally, gait speed was related to decline in information processing speed and executive functioning. Weaker grip strength was related to worse baseline information processing speed and executive functioning but there were no longitudinal associations. Cox proportional hazards models revealed no significant associations with clinical progression. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that markers of physical performance are related to current cognitive status and modestly related to cognitive decline but are seemingly not useful as an early marker of incident clinical progression...|$|R

50|$|The wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) {{hypothesis}} {{was prompted by}} observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions {{as a result of}} the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. Note that in this scenario birds need downforce to give their <b>feet</b> increased <b>grip.</b> But early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism that modern birds' wings use to produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce that WAIR requires is generated by upstrokes, it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR.|$|R

5000|$|Boots {{which are}} {{designed}} for walking through snow, shallow water and mud may be made of a single closely stitched design (using leather, rubber, canvas, or similar material) to prevent the entry of water, snow, mud or dirt through gaps between the laces and tongue found in other types of shoes. Waterproof gumboots are made in different lengths of uppers. In extreme cases, thigh-boots called waders, worn by anglers, extend to the hip. Such boots may also be insulated for warmth. With the exception of gum boots, boots sold in general retail stores may be considered [...] "water resistant," [...] as they are not usually fully waterproof, compared to high-end boots for fishers or hikers. Speciality boots {{have been made to}} protect steelworkers' feet and calves if they get accidentally step in puddles of molten metal, to protect workers from a variety of chemical exposure, to protect workers from construction site hazards and to protect feet from extreme cold (e.g., with insulated or inflatable boots for use in Antarctica). Most work boots are [...] "laceups" [...] made from leather. Formerly they were usually shod with hobnails and heel- and toe-plates, but now can usually be seen with a thick rubber sole, and often with steel toecaps. Boots are normally worn with socks to prevent chafes and blisters, to absorb sweat, to improve the <b>foot's</b> <b>grip</b> inside the boot, or to insulate the foot from the cold. Before socks became widely available, footwraps were worn instead.Specialty boots have been designed for many different types of sports, particularly riding, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, and sporting in wet/damp conditions.|$|R

60|$|Philip had {{a little}} {{furniture}} which he had gathered as he went along, an arm-chair that he had bought in Paris, and a table, a few drawings, and the small Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. His uncle had offered a fold-up bed for which, now {{that he no longer}} let his house in August, he had no further use; and by spending another ten pounds Philip bought himself whatever else was essential. He spent ten shillings on putting a corn-coloured paper in the room he was making his parlour; and he hung on the walls a sketch which Lawson had given him of the Quai des Grands Augustins, and the photograph of the Odalisque by Ingres and Manet's Olympia which in Paris had been the objects of his contemplation while he shaved. To remind himself that he too had once been engaged in the practice of art, he put up a charcoal drawing of the young Spaniard Miguel Ajuria: {{it was the best thing}} he had ever done, a nude standing with clenched hands, his <b>feet</b> <b>gripping</b> the floor with a peculiar force, and on his face that air of determination which had been so impressive; and though Philip after the long interval saw very well the defects of his work its associations made him look upon it with tolerance. He wondered what had happened to Miguel. There is nothing so terrible as the pursuit of art by those who have no talent. Perhaps, worn out by exposure, starvation, disease, he had found an end in some hospital, or in an access of despair had sought death in the turbid Seine; but perhaps with his Southern instability he had given up the struggle of his own accord, and now, a clerk in some office in Madrid, turned his fervent rhetoric to politics and bull-fighting.|$|R
50|$|Grip tape is a {{sheet of}} paper or fabric with {{adhesive}} {{on one side and a}} surface similar to fine sand paper on the other. Grip tape is applied to the top surface of a board to allow the rider's <b>feet</b> to <b>grip</b> the surface and help the skater stay on the board while doing tricks. Grip tape is usually black, but is also available in many different colors such as pink, red, yellow, checkered, camo, and even clear. Often, they have designs die-cut to show the color of the board, or to display the board's company logo. Grip tape accumulates dirt and other substances that will inhibit grip, so use of a grip eraser or rubber eraser is necessary after riding through mud or with dirty shoes.|$|R

Many companies, including Swix, Toko, Holmenkol, Briko, and Maplus are dedicated to ski wax production and have developed a range of products to cover various conditions.|$|R
6000|$|After sermon {{we looked}} at the old castle, which made me an old man. The castle was not a bit older for the twenty-five years which had passed away, but the ruins of the visitor were very apparent; to climb up round staircases, to creep through vaults and into dungeons, were not the easy labours but the {{positive}} sports of my younger years; but that time is gone by, and I thought it convenient to attempt no more than the access to the large and beautiful hall in which, as it is somewhere described, an armed horseman might brandish his lance. The feeling of growing and increasing inability is painful to one like me, who boasted, in spite of my infirmity, great boldness and dexterity in such feats; the boldness remains, but hand and <b>foot,</b> <b>grip</b> and accuracy of step, have altogether failed me; the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and so I must retreat into the invalided corps and tell them of my former exploits, which may very likely pass for lies. We drove to Dalhousie Castle, where the gallant Earl, who had done so much to distinguish the British name in all and every quarter of the globe, is repairing the castle of his ancestors, which of yore stood a siege against John of Gaunt. I was Lord Dalhousie's companion at school, where he was as much beloved by his companions as he has been ever respected by his companions-in-arms, and the people over whom he has been deputed to exercise the authority of his sovereign. He was always steady, wise, and generous. The old Castle of Dalhousie--potius Dalwolsey--was mangled by a fellow called, I believe, Douglas, who destroyed, as far as in him lay, its military and baronial character, and roofed it after the fashion of a poor-house. The architect, Burn, is now restoring and repairing in the old taste, and I think creditably to his own feeling. God bless the roof-tree! ...|$|R
