5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a {{pandemic}} of Asian flu; although the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>flu</b> emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E

The surveillance was still continue after 2003, {{the outbreak of}} H 5 N 1 bird flu in Southeast Asia. More then twenty thousands of fecal samples and cloaca swabs were collected from ducks and shorebirds in wetlands and riverbanks distributed in Taiwan and KingMen islet. 286 of {{avian influenza}} viruses were isolated by inoculated the specemens into the eggs of special pathogen free (SPF) and these viruses were identified as influenza A by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in NP gene and then subtyped the hemagglutinin and neunaminidase genes by one set of 15 H and 9 N primer for PCR method.

Doctors {{spent a lot of}} time explaining to media representatives and live TV cameras that the former AFP chief of staff did not die from the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Bird <b>Flu.</b> Enrile, 57, was rushed to the Makati Medical Center Monday after collapsing at home. Doctors said the retired general was in a state of shock when he reached the hospital. An official medical bulletin said Enrile died from complications arising from virulent viral infection, or [...] "multiple organ failure due to septic shock and streptococcal pneumonic bacteraemia." [...] President Ramos expressed his deep condolences for the [...] "untimely demise of a devoted public servant and leader" [...] and attended the wake.|$|R
40|$|In 1997, 18 {{cases of}} {{influenza}} in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> (bird <b>flu)</b> {{caused by a}} novel H 5 N 1 (chicken) virus resulted {{in the deaths of}} six individuals and once again raised the specter of a potentially devastating influenza pandemic. Slaughter of the poultry in the live bird markets removed the source of infection and no further human cases of H 5 N 1 infection have occurred. In March 1999, however, a new pandemic threat appeared when influenza A H 9 N 2 viruses infected two children in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong.</b> These two virus isolates are similar to an H 9 N 2 virus isolated from a quail in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> in late 1997. Although differing in their surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase components, a notable feature of these H 9 N 2 viruses is that the six genes encoding the internal components of the virus {{are similar to those of}} the 1997 H 5 N 1 human and avian isolates. This common feature emphasizes the apparent propensity of avian viruses with this genetic complement to infect humans and highlights the potential for the emergence of a novel human pathogen. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|In February 2004, avian {{influenza}} virus was detected in birds in Vietnam, increasing {{fears of the}} emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the {{avian influenza}} virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the Spanish Flu, or the lower mortality pandemics such as the Asian Flu and the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Flu.</b>|$|E
25|$|Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China, and {{has been}} {{detected}} in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears {{of the emergence of}} new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as H2N2 did when it evolved into the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Flu</b> strain of H3N2.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Flu</b> was a {{category}} 2 flu pandemic {{caused by a}} strain of H3N2 descended from H2N2 by antigenic shift, in which genes from multiple subtypes reassorted {{to form a new}} virus.
