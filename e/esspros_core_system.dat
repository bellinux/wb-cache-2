40|$|The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> is a {{proposed}} standard for a device-independent graphics system. The {{concept of a}} device-independent system was first developed in 1977 by the Graphics Standards Planning Committee (GSPC) of ACM Siggraph and later refined in 1979 [1, 2]. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> design has received favorable reviews and has been implemented by various vendors at several universities, and other computing facilities (e. g. [3, 7]). The main objectives of the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> are to provide uniformity, compatibility, and flexibility in graphics software. Three advantages that the <b>CORE</b> <b>system</b> provides over non-standard graphics systems are device independence, program portability, and functional completeness. A large number of different graphics hardware devices currently exist {{with a wide range}} of available functions. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> provides device independence by shielding the applications programmer from specific hardware characteristics. The shielding is at the functional level: the device-independent (DI) system uses internal routines to convert the application programmer 2 ̆ 7 s functional commands to specific commands for the selected hardware device driver (DD). The progammer describes a graphical world to the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> in device-independent normalized device coordinates. The programmer also specifies the viewport on the logical view surface (output device) where a picture segment is to be placed. As the <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> becomes the accepted standard graphics package, program portability will become more feasible. Program portability means the ability to transport application programs between two sites without requiring structural modifications. The <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> was designed for functional completeness so that any graphics function a programmer desires is either included within the system or can be easily built on top of <b>CORE</b> <b>System</b> routines...|$|R
40|$|Statement of problem: Techniques and {{recommendations}} {{for the restoration of}} endodontically treated teeth have changed from the use of custom cast metal post and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> to glass fiber-reinforced (GFRC) post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Has this latest prefabricated glass fiber reinforced post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system</b> increased the fracture resistance of teeth and reduced the incidence of unrestorable root fractures. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the incidence of root fracture and mode of failure of endodontically treated teeth restored with two different post and <b>core</b> <b>systems.</b> Material and methods: Forty maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into two groups. (n= 20). All teeth received endodontic treatment. First group was restored with custom cast post and <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Second group was restored with glass fiber post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> In Both the groups posts were cemented with adhesive resin cement. Compressive load was applied at an angle of 130 to the long axis of teeth at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. Data were analyzed with student 't' test P<. 001. Results: The mean value for fracture resistance was (331. 4025) N in Group -I Custom cast Ni-Cr post and core and (237. 0625) N in Group -II Glass fiber reinforced post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> Students 't' test shows the significant difference in fracture resistance of two groups. Conclusion: This study showed that the incidence of root fracture was significantly higher in custom cast Ni-Cr post and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> than glass fiber post and composite <b>core</b> <b>system.</b> A more favourable mode of failure was observed in teeth restored with Group II glass fiber post system...|$|R

In 2005, China started research on the drilling <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> and drilling techniques for its application to the permafrost gas hydrate. In the 2008, first testing of drilling and coring with the new wire-line pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system</b> for the permafrost gas hydrate in Qing-Tibet Plateau, Qilian Mountain, above sea level of 4200 m was conducted to collect gas hydrate samples from 130 m to 400 m depth [...] In order to confirm the presence of gas hydrate, drilling and coring continued in 2009 and 2010, and additional gas hydrate samples were acquired and tested in the laboratory. In order to use the gas hydrate resource, additional testing of the gas hydrate in the permafrost was conducted with depressurization and reservoir heating in September, 2011. During this testing, electro-magnetic, solar energy and vapor heating methods were used, and the reservoir pressure was decreased by the submarine pump by bringing the subsurface water to the surface. The testing was considered successful. The pressure and temperature <b>coring</b> <b>system,</b> the drilling and the production processes and the results are described in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Normally, {{the owner}} must {{contract}} with construction contractors and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> contractor {{at the same}} time in the public projects. Especially, for an infrastructure project, the <b>core</b> <b>system</b> contractor and construction contractor may sometimes pass their requests concerning with ambiguous conditions of interfaces to the owner by changing the design, or by modifying the works. In spite of reasonable or unreasonable requests, this situation always mutually causes both parties to face unexpected happenings and to suffer unknown risks. Also, for the both parties, it is not likely to exactly estimate the extra cost and time brought by the interface risks. Nevertheless, there are lots of problems concerning with the risk allocation in the engineering interfaces between construction and <b>core</b> <b>system</b> contracts, but not any contract relationship between both of these parties.

40|$|Only humans {{possess the}} faculty of {{language}} that allows an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions (Hauser et al., 2002; Berwick and Chomsky, 2015). Similarly, humans have a capacity for infinite natural numbers, while all other species seem to lack such a capacity (Gelman and Gallistel, 1978; Dehaene, 1997). Thus, {{the origin of this}} numerical capacity and its relation to language have been of much interdisciplinary interest in developmental and behavioral psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and linguistics (Dehaene, 1997; Hauser et al., 2002; Pica et al., 2004). Hauser et al. (2002) and Chomsky (2008) hypothesize that a recursive generative operation that is central to the computational system of language (called Merge) can give rise to the successor function in a set-theoretic fashion, from which capacities for discretely infinite natural numbers may be derived. However, a careful look at two domains in language, grammatical number and numerals, reveals no trace of the successor function. Following behavioral and neuropsychological evidence that there are two <b>core</b> <b>systems</b> of number cognition innately available, a <b>core</b> <b>system</b> of representation of large, approximate numerical magnitudes and a <b>core</b> <b>system</b> of precise representation of distinct small numbers (Feigenson et al., 2004), I argue that grammatical number reflects the <b>core</b> <b>system</b> of precise representation of distinct small numbers alone. In contrast, numeral systems arise from integrating the pre-existing two <b>core</b> <b>systems</b> of number and the human language faculty. To the extent that my arguments are correct, linguistic representations of number, grammatical number, and numerals do not incorporate anything like the successor function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} {{varieties of}} probabilism capable of distilling paradox-free qualitative doxastic notions (e. g., full belief, expectation, and plain belief) from {{a notion of}} probability taken as a primitive. We show that <b>core</b> <b>systems,</b> collections of nested propositions expressible in the underlying algebra, can {{play a crucial role}} in these derivations. We demonstrate how the notion of a probability core can be naturally generalized to high probability, giving rise to what we call a high probability core, a notion that when formulated in terms of classical monadic probability coincides with the notion of stability proposed by Hannes Leitgeb [32]. Our work continues by one of us in collaboration with Rohit Parikh [7]. In turn, the latter work was inspired by the seminal work of Bas van Fraassen [46]. We argue that the adoption of dyadic probability as a primitive (as articulated by van Fraassen [46]) admits a smoother connection with the standard theory of probability cores as well as a better model in which to situate doxastic notions like full belief. We also illustrate how the basic structure underlying a <b>system</b> of <b>cores</b> naturally leads to alternative probabilistic acceptance rules, like the so-called ratio rule initially proposed by Isaac Levi [34]. <b>Core</b> <b>systems</b> in their various guises are ubiquitous in many areas of formal epistemology (e. g., belief revision, the semantics of conditionals, modal logic, etc.). We argue that <b>core</b> <b>systems</b> can also play a natural and important role in Bayesian epistemology and decision theory. In fact, the final part of the article shows that probabilistic <b>core</b> <b>systems</b> are naturally derivable from basic decision-theoretic axioms which incorporate only qualitative aspects of core systems; that the qualitative aspects of <b>core</b> <b>systems</b> alone can be naturally integrated in the articulation of coherence of primitive conditional probability; and that the guiding idea behind the primary qualitative features of a <b>core</b> <b>system</b> gives rise to the formulation of lexicographic decision rules...|$|R
