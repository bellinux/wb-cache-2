5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other <b>in</b> <b>camera.</b> The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the <b>in</b> <b>camera</b> hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

On 13 December 1921 an order was issued by King George V for Speyer to be struck off {{the list of the}} Privy Council. The next person to be struck off the list was Elliot Morley in 2011, though others resigned in the intervening period.|$|E

50|$|Fixed focus {{can be a}} less {{expensive}} alternative to autofocus, which requires electronics, moving parts, and power. Since fixed-focus lenses require no input from the operator, they are suitable for use <b>in</b> <b>cameras</b> designed to be inexpensive, or to operate without electrical power as <b>in</b> disposable <b>cameras,</b> or <b>in</b> low-end 35 mm film point and shoot <b>cameras,</b> or <b>in</b> <b>cameras</b> featuring simple operation. These are usually wide-angle lenses with fixed aperture, and cameras with these lenses generally use a viewfinder for composition.|$|R

5|$|Yttrium {{has been}} studied as a nodulizer in ductile cast iron, forming the {{graphite}} into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase ductility and fatigue resistance. Having a high melting point, yttrium oxide is used in some ceramic and glass to impart shock resistance and low thermal expansion properties. Those same properties make such glass useful <b>in</b> <b>camera</b> lenses.|$|E

Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press <b>in</b> <b>camera</b> car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed <b>in</b> <b>camera,</b> with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|The Gun Court is {{the branch}} of the Jamaican {{judicial}} system that tries criminal cases involving firearms. The Court was established by Parliament in 1974 to combat rising gun violence, and empowered to try suspects <b>in</b> <b>camera,</b> without a jury. The Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and Resident Magistrate's Courts function as Gun Courts whenever they hear firearms cases. There is also a Western Regional Gun Court in Montego Bay. Those convicted by the Gun Court are imprisoned in a dedicated prison compound at South Camp in Kingston. Until 1999, the Gun Court sessions were also held in the same facility.|$|E

5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (<b>in</b> <b>camera),</b> and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments <b>in</b> <b>camera,</b> on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held <b>in</b> <b>camera,</b> and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E
5000|$|Depth {{of focus}} is a lens optics concept that {{measures}} the tolerance of {{placement of the}} image plane (the film plane <b>in</b> a <b>camera)</b> <b>in</b> relation to the lens. <b>In</b> a <b>camera,</b> depth of focus indicates the tolerance of the film's displacement within the camera, and is therefore {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "lens-to-film tolerance." ...|$|R

The flash is connected electrically to the camera either by a cable with a standardised coaxial PC (for Prontor/Compur) 3.5 mm (1/8") connector (as defined in ISO 519), or via contacts in an accessory mount (hot shoe) bracket.|$|R

40|$|To track people {{successfully}} <b>in</b> multiple <b>cameras,</b> {{one needs}} to establish correspondence between objects captured <b>in</b> each <b>camera.</b> We present a system for tracking people <b>in</b> multiple uncalibrated <b>cameras.</b> The system is able to discover spatial relationships between the camera fields of view and use this information to correspond between different perspective views of the same person. We employ the novel approach of finding the limits of field of view (FOV) of a <b>camera</b> as visible <b>in</b> the other <b>cameras.</b> Using this information, {{when a person is}} seen <b>in</b> one <b>camera,</b> we are able to predict all the other <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> which this person will be visible. Moreover, we apply the FOV constraint to disambiguate between possible candidates for correspondence. Tracking <b>in</b> each individual <b>camera</b> needs to be resolved before such an analysis can be applied. We perform tracking <b>in</b> a single <b>camera</b> using background subtraction, followed by region correspondence. This takes into account the velocities, sizes and distance of bounding boxes obtained through connected component labeling. We present results on sequences taken from the PETS 2001 dataset, which contain several persons and vehicles simultaneously. The proposed approach is very fast compared to camera calibration based approaches...|$|R
