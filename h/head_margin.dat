50|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} the D. gribodoi male are its mandible shape (the anterior quarter notably flexed inward) and the nearly flat posterior <b>head</b> <b>margin.</b> In the original description Emery compared D. gribodoi with D. atratus and stated that D. atratus was darker than D. gribodoi and that its scape was longer than half {{the length of the}} funiculus. Both Smith (1859) in the original description and later Santschi (1914) mentioned that the posterior <b>head</b> <b>margin</b> of the D. atratus male was convex. While the colouration of D. gribodoi is variable, it is not uniformly black in any of the specimens examined by us and the head shape is nearly rectangular with a flat posterior margin. Workers of D. gribodoi are unique (and easily identifiable) among all Dorylus species in having a nearly round petiole in dorsal view and a distinct ridge on the posterior <b>head</b> <b>margin</b> that is laterally developed into tiny horns in larger specimens. D. gribodoi workers of the same size class can be separated from workers of the D. kohli / D. congolensis complex also by the posterior margin of the head being angular in lateral view and not smoothly rounded.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was quantitatively to {{establish}} {{the relationship between the}} plane that hosts the humeral head lateral margin (anatomical neck) and that of the capsular insertion. Eight cadaveric shoulders were used. These were dissected, exposing the humeral <b>head</b> <b>margin</b> and the root of the capsular humeral insertion to extract digitally their outlines using a mechanical 3 -d digitizer. The datasets of the digitized outlines were applied and the geometric planes they best fitted mathematically calculated. Vector analysis techniques were finally applied to the two planes to quantify the relationship between them. The humeral <b>head</b> <b>margin</b> is circular (± 2. 2 % of radius), having each of its outlining points on the same plane (within ± 1. 5 mm.) The capsular attachment outlining points also insert on a plane (± 1. 4 mm). The two planes are related to one another by an inclination of 14. 5 ± 3. 6 °. The relationship described here would allow for in vivo prediction of humeral attachment of capsular structures by using radiological datasets of the anatomical neck.

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ongoing {{effort to}} {{lower the cost of}} access to space, the Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} a rocket engine with 60, 000 pounds of thrust for use on the Reusable Launch Vehicle technology demonstrator slated for launch in 2000. This gas generator cycle engine, known as the Fastrac engine, uses liquid oxygen and RP- 1 for propellants and includes single stage liquid oxygen and RP- 1 pumps and a single stage supersonic turbine on a common shaft. The turbopump design effort included the first use and application of new suction capability prediction codes and three-dimensional blade generation codes in an attempt to reduce the turbomachinery design and certification costs typically associated with rocket engine development. To verify the pump's predicted cavitation performance, a water flow test of a superscale model of the Fastrac liquid oxygen pump was conducted to experimentally evaluate the liquid oxygen pump's performance at and around the design point. The water flow test article replicated the flow path of the Fastrac liquid oxygen pump in a 1. 582 x scale model, including scaled seal clearances for correct leakage flow at a model operating speed of 5000 revolutions per minute. Flow entered the 3 -blade axial-flow inducer, transitioned to a shrouded, 6 - blade radial impeller, and discharged into a vaneless radial diffuser and collection volute. The test article included approximately 50 total and static pressure measurement locations as well as flush-mounted, high frequency pressure transducers for complete mapping of the pressure environment. The primary objectives of the water flow test were to measure the steady-state and dynamic pressure environment of the liquid oxygen pump versus flow coefficient, suction specific speed, and back face leakage flow rate. Initial results showed acceptable correlation between the predicted and experimentally measured pump head rise at low suction specific speeds. Likewise, only small circumferential variations in steady-state were observed from 80 % to 120 % of the design flow coefficient, matching the computational predictions and confirming that the integrated design approach has minimized any exit volute-induced distortions. The test article exhibited suction performance trends typically observed in inducer designs with virtually constant head rise with decreasing inlet pressure until complete pump head breakdown. Unfortunately, the net positive suction head at 3 % head fall-off occurred far below that predicted at all tested flow coefficients, resulting in a negative net positive suction <b>head</b> <b>margin</b> at the design point in water. Additional testing to map the unsteady pressure environment was conducted and cavitation-induced flow disturbances at the inducer inlet were observed. Two distinct disturbances were identified, one rotating and one stationary relative to the fixed frame of reference, while the transition from one regime to the next produced significant effects on the steady state pump performance. The impact of the unsteady phenomena and the corresponding energy losses on the unexpectedly poor pump performance is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Dealer description: Illuminated vellum {{manuscript}} {{with a fine}} historiated initial showing {{scenes from}} the life of King David and with a decorative border including a hunting scene. Text from Psalm 1 : 1 - 2 : 8. Southern Netherlands [possibly Saint-Omer], late 13 th century, 140 x 102 mm (5. 5 "x 4 "). Single column, 19 lines in an excellent gothic liturgical hand. Versal initials in red or blue, three line blue initial on verso with wispy red penwork elaboration in the form of delicately drawn ivy leaves extending into three margins (slightly trimmed at the top). RECTO with a wonderfully animated 12 -line historiated "B" (60 x 55 mm) in pink and white tracery, the initial on a ground of blue and pink knotwork, the upper compartment containing a miniature of King David harping in his palace (the towers of which poke through into the <b>head</b> <b>margin),</b> and the lower compartment showing the young David about to behead the giant Goliath, who is attired in a tunic and chainmail, both scnese in colors on a burnished gold ground, the initial with branching leafy border extending into all four margins, the border composed of blue and pink bars with twining leaves and berries in pink, blue and orange at the corners, a bas-de-page scene of a hunter with a horn and bow accompanied by two hounds pursuing a leaping stag, one blue bird flying up along the fore-edge margin and another perched atop the initial, pecking at a berry, a delightful lion dozing on {{the very top of the}} text, his improbably long tail extending down 13 lines. Gold mostly lost now (revealing white gesso), script a little difficult to read beacuse of fading or erosion, a number of very tiny holes where ink has eaten through the vellum, other minor defects, but none of these imperfections fatal, the vellum generally well preserved, and the original appeal of the dynamic leaf still largely intact. This is the extremely charming opening leaf of a very fine early gothic Psaltrer with spirited decoration, doubtless made for lay use. The scene in the lower margin shows a stag hunt, probably very familiar from the world of a patron. The subject and composition of the Beatus initial, with two scenes from David's life, became characteristic of the Southern Netherlands, especially in Ghent and Saint-Omer (cf. G. Haselhoff, "Die Psalterillustration im 13. Jahrhundert," pp. 112 - 122, and K. Carlvant, "Manuscript Painting in Thirteen-Century Flanders, Bruges, Ghent and the Circle of the COunts," p. 341.) The theme of Psalm 1 is the triumph of righteousness over evil, and the beheading of Goliath was an appropriate motif. Smililarly, the lion, crouching at the upper right here, had been a common theme for Psalm 1 in romanesque Psalters. The delicate style loosely resembles that of the manuscripts clustered around the Psalter of Guy de Dampierre (Brussels, B.
