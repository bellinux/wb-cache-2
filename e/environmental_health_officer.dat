2500|$|The BBC's {{findings}} have drawn mixed reactions from the Muslim community. <b>Environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officer</b> Dr Yunes Ramadan Teinaz told the British broadcaster about commercially marketed Zamzam water that, [...] "People see this {{water as a}} holy water. They {{find it difficult to}} accept that it is contaminated, but the authorities in Saudi Arabia or in the U.K. must take action." [...] The Saudi authorities have stated that water from the well was tested by the Group Laboratories of CARSO-LSEHL in Lyon, licensed by the French Ministry of Health for the testing of drinking water. According to reports of these results, the level of arsenic in Zamzam water taken at its source is much lower than the maximum amount permitted by the World Health Organization. The Saudi authorities have thus said that the water is fit for human consumption. Zuhair Nawab, president of the Saudi Geological Survey (SGS), has claimed that the Zamzam Well is tested on a daily basis, in a process involving the taking of three samples from the well. These are said to be examined in the King Abdullah Zamzam Water Distribution Center in Mecca, which is equipped with advanced facilities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Officers</b> (also {{known as}} Public <b>Health</b> Inspectors or <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> Practitioners) are {{responsible}} for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards. They {{are involved in a}} variety of activities, for example inspecting food facilities, investigating public health nuisances, and implementing disease control. <b>Environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> are focused on prevention, consultation, investigation, and education of the community regarding health risks and maintaining a safe environment.|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study aimed {{to describe how}} <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> prioritized different components of food regulation enforcement {{within the context of}} their overall workload, to gather information about how to better prepare <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> for the demands of their role. A significant change in the role of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> is occurring due to new legislative requirements related to food labelling. In 2003, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council (the Ministerial Council) developed a Policy Guideline on Nutrition, Health and Related Claims (the Policy Guideline), providing a framework for the regulation of nutrition, health and related claims. <b>Environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> are likely to be responsible for the enforcement of these proposed new regulations. The proposed monitoring role is as yet untested and the factors influencing the <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> officers’ decisions about prioritization of work load are unknown. The priority given to the enforcement of such regulations may impact on how effectively <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> perform this aspect of their work load. The data used in this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 37 <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers</b> from three states, NSW, QLD and ACT. The sample included male and female officers at both field and senior level across local and state sites. The interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic coding {{with the aid of a}} qualitative software analysis package. The work and control scales survey data were analyzed using SPSS 15. Results showed that field officers considered themselves to be protectors of the community’s health, closely interacting with the community and responding to their demands and complaints. Field officers’ routine inspections and investigation of food poisoning and hygiene complaints were given highest priority, while monitoring health claims on food labels was given low priority. Conversely, senior officers reported being more involved with management, interacting with outside organizations and politics, and assigned higher priority to the monitoring of health claims on food labels. The analysis of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> officers’ work practices and attitudes using the framework of Lipsky’s (1980) theory of street-level-bureaucracy was used to enhance present understanding of the implications for policy implementation at the interface between the public and government. This study extends existing knowledge about the motivations behind the work practice of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers,</b> a poorly researched group, and explores their roles within Lipsky’s framework of street-level bureaucrats. The study thus extends Lipsky’s model into a new area of work practice. Contrary to previous studies indicating street-level bureaucrats use coping mechanisms to decrease frustration caused by work conditions, this study’s results revealed that the desire to create positive outcomes for the community drove the behaviour of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers.</b> Further results from this study indicate that <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers,</b> through their work practices and especially in their enforcement role, have the capacity to optimize or lessen the benefits to consumers of food regulations such as nutrition and health related claims on food labels. Three major recommendations arise out of this study to ensure that consumers benefit from the new legislation regarding nutrition and health related claims on food labels. There should be provision of sufficient resources and timely training in new responsibilities for <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers.</b> Communication between State and local government authorities must continue to be improved and maintained, so that adequate support and appropriate guidance from team leaders is consistently available. Lastly, increased public education regarding the importance of nutrition, health and related claims as a tool to make healthier food purchases is needed...|$|R

50|$|A Public Health Inspector (also {{known as}} an <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Officer)</b> investigates health hazards {{in a wide variety}} of settings, and will take action to {{mitigate}} or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food safety set by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (<b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>officer)</b> also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness. They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.|$|E
