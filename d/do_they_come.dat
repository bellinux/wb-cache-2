500|$|The {{domestic}} {{guinea pig}} (Cavia porcellus), [...] or simply guinea pig, {{also known as}} cavy or cuy as livestock, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, these animals {{are not in the}} pig family Suidae, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild. Recent studies applying molecular markers, in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals, revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.|$|E

500|$|When {{predicting}} {{what would}} be in store for season four, Scott Bakula suggested {{that he would like}} to see the crew come to terms with the emotional scars of the mission they had against the Xindi in the third season. He wanted several questions to be covered, such as [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> back into society, how do they re-adjust their behaviors? What has happened to them will always be inside of them, every time they're confronted with new situations." [...] Following the resolution of the mission in [...] "", he wanted the crew to receive [...] "a great reception" [...] on their return to Earth. He was pleased with how this was handled in the series, describing [...] "Home" [...] as [...] "a great episode". When actress Jolene Blalock revealed that her character would be getting married in [...] "Home", she joked that she wouldn't need to fight someone – a reference to the [...] episode [...] "Amok Time".

2500|$|The {{idea that}} {{behavior}} is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions.

2500|$|Yet Jackson {{would not}} be the only {{president}} to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America's destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: [...] "A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase [...] "Manifest Destiny". They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from any one source." ...|$|E

2500|$|Humanity {{has lost}} meaning because the {{accepted}} criterion {{of reality and}} truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with logic, historical research, or scientific analysis. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship {{is a way of}} looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny.|$|E
