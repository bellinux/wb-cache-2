In order to design and implement the appropriate government's need {{to take into account the}} five aspects of sustainable logistics. The first one is reducing freight transport intensity as it is becoming necessary for governments to introduce explicit policies to encourage companies to reduce the amount of freight movement within their system. The second aspect is freight modal split, which the author describes as shifting freight to greener transport modes. Governments can promote this by utilizing policy instruments (usually taxation, financial incentives, regulation, and <b>infrastructural</b> <b>measures).</b> The third aspect is vehicle utilization which governments must attempt to promote companies to improve their utilization of road freight. This can be done through taxation, regulation, liberalization, and advice committees. The fourth aspect is increasing energy efficiency which often is seen with the introduction of general efficiency programs. Governments can raise fuel duty, subsidize driver training schemes, reduce and enforce speed limits, impose fuel economy standards, incentivize scrappage of old vehicles and give advice in order to promote a higher standard of energy efficiency.

40|$|From an {{evolutionary}} point of view, endozoochory {{can be considered}} as a¿mutualistic process, in which both the plant seed- dispersing animal species and the dispersed plant species benefit. Disperser benefits may be direct, by using the dispersed plant species as a¿food source, and indirect, by promoting the distribution of these food plants. Despite biomass loss involved, plant species may benefit from endozoochory, because it promotes long-distance dispersal and linked advantages. We tested this mutualism hypothesis in the Po¿ana Biosphere Reserve, central Slovakia, with red deer (Cervus elaphus) as disperser. We collected data on distances covered by red deer between seed ingestion and excretion sites, and the corresponding vegetation by VHF telemetry and GIS analysis. We assessed the viable seed content of red deer dung by a¿germination test. Information on forage palatability, habitat and seed longevity of the dispersed species were taken from literature. From a¿total of 400 g¿dry red deer feces, 1766 seedlings emerged, belonging to 43 species. Most of the observed dispersal distances exceeded 100 m, which is commonly considered as a¿minimum for long-distance dispersal. Red deer transported mostly seeds from a¿variety of vegetation types to forests. Our results support the hypothesis that endozoochory is a¿mutualistic process. We conclude that, since landscapes are changing due to global warming and land use changes, {{it is important for the}} maintenance of plant species diversity to promote migration and free ranging of large grazers like red deer, by means of <b>infrastructural</b> <b>measure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Motorized {{transport}} modes {{have caused}} many transport problems. There {{is an increasing}} concern {{about the importance of}} sustainable transport. Cycling has been widely recognized as a sustainable transport in many European countries. However, although cycling {{is one of the major}} transport modes in many new towns, the role of cycling is still only be regarded as a recreational activity in Hong Kong. The significance of utility cycling, especially the use of bicycle for education trips, has been undervalued. Therefore, this study aims to address on the importance of utility cycling to children and to increase cycle use among school children in new towns. Through carrying out an interview survey at the new town which has the highest cycle use, major obstacles to promote cycling to school have been found. As most of them are related to psychological barriers, the use of traditional approach which is <b>infrastructural</b> <b>measure</b> may not be effective. Non-infrastructural measures, so-called as ‘soft measures’, are proved to be useful to encourage more children to cycle to school. With reference to foreign experience, it is found that a coordinated approach involving many different parties is the success to promote utility cycling. This dissertation concludes by giving out recommendations on how each party could make use of soft measures to promote cycling as an alternative transport for school children in new towns. Although this study cannot reflect the whole picture of utility cycling, it could stimulate more interest for further research on the development of cycling in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R

40|$|The Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) Climate Change and Adaptation Initiative (CCAI) aims at formulating the Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the Lower Mekong Basin. An {{important}} first step in developing this strategy is to review international experiences of existing strategies, to learn from their process and their implementation, and to derive recommendations for a Mekong Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan (MASAP). This report provides {{a review of existing}} transboundary/basin-wide adaptation strategies. Relevant international basins and regions worldwide were first identified for the review. At the basin level, adaptation strategies of four basins were selected for review, including the Nile, Danube, Rhine and Neman. At the regional level, adaptation strategies of four regional cooperation organisations were reviewed – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adaptation strategy, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa-East African Community-Southern African Development Community (COMESA-EAC-SADC) Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for the water sector, the European Adaptation Strategy, and the Amazonian Strategic Cooperation Agenda. The analysis in this report is based on the framework and steps for the development of an adaptation strategy, which is derived from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Guidance on Water and Adaptation to Climate Change. A comparison was made between the UNECE framework and the CCAI framework. The review was based on the following aspects: • the overall formulation process, which examines, inter alia, how the strategy was developed, the parties involved, the duration of the process and the time horizon of the strategy; • the enabling environment, which looks at hindrances to adaptation. The enabling environment includes the policy, legal and institutional frameworks within which the strategy is developed; • the information used and required, including the information management, the impact assessment and the vulnerability assessment; • the goals, objectives and measures of the strategy; • the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the strategy. The review finds that initiatives for developing an adaptation strategy generally rely on the collaboration between the involved ministers, often ministers responsible for water management, and the transboundary institution responsible for coordination. Through the mandate, the parties 2 International experiences on the formulation and implementation of transboundary climate change adaptation strategies can ensure that their interests are included in the process. The first step in developing the strategy is usually a study on the climate change vulnerability of the basin or region. This is mainly achieved by compiling the available studies and drawing generic conclusions from them. Based on the vulnerability assessment, adaptation measures are identified, usually in broad terms, to enable adjusting these measures to the local conditions. The process of developing the adaptation strategy is generally carried out in close cooperation between the countries including the joint body, and representatives and experts of the individual countries at the national level. Usually also a broad range of stakeholders are involved through meetings and workshops. The process of developing an adaptation strategy is considered continuous as changing circumstances, due to climate change, socioeconomic and demographic developments, and changes in vulnerability and the relevant measures may change. In practice, this implies that an adaptation strategy once developed is reviewed every five to ten years to account for the changing environment. To make sure that both the process and the resulting strategy are relevant, efficient and effective, and have the expected impact, the process should be continuously evaluated. The time needed to elaborate the strategy, the time between the adoption of the mandate to develop a strategy and the adoption of the strategy by the parties, varies between one to six years. This depends, among others, on the available information and the extent of the mandate (e. g. a detailed versus a more generic strategy). In general, a period of two to three years is needed, but can be shortened when much of the preparatory work has been finalized, for instance on the vulnerability assessment. The climate change outlook {{to be included in the}} strategy usually extends to 2050. A longer time horizon is, however, useful when the strategy includes measures that imply long-term investments, for example, for infrastructures. The infrastructures should therefore be built so as to account for the longerterm projections of climate and other changes. Moreover, since climate change projections become more uncertain as they extend further in time, a time horizon of 2050 with some outlook until 2100 seems an appropriate approach. An important issue is to consider an integrated approach where the strategy is mainstreamed in the relevant policies. This will avoid contradictory policies and hindrances to implement specific measures. Benefits of transboundary cooperation are generally ignored or taken for granted. It is recommended to explicitly clarify the expected benefits of the joint strategy to ensure better implementation of the strategy. International experiences on the formulation and implementation of 3 transboundary climate change adaptation strategies Financing of the measures comes from the national budgets and from donors, depending on the economic situation in the countries. The Danube river basin strategy, for instance, has incorporated the implementation of the strategy in the process of implementing European Union (EU) directives, where the funding largely comes from national budgets. The EU strategy is aiming at directing funds to adaptation. The COMESA-EAC-SADC strategy aims at improving the access to international funds. The mandate adopted as well as the involvement of government representatives in the process of developing the strategy should ensure that the strategy is in line with the respective national policies and legislation, including international agreements. If it appears that the existing policy and/or legislation contradicts the goals and objectives of the mandate or the strategy, reconsideration of these policies and legislation should be included as part of the measures of the strategy. Also, adapting the institutional arrangements may be part of the strategy. The COMESA-EAC-SADC strategy, for instance, explicitly aims at capacity building and improvement of the institutions. An important element in developing the strategy is that there is agreement on the impacts and related vulnerabilities. This entails exchange of all relevant information and extended communication about scenarios and projections between the parties. The generic objective of the strategies is to reduce the vulnerability of society and ecosystems to climate change and improve resilience. The specific goals and objectives for each strategy reflect the priorities of the parties in the different strategies and are rooted in the differences in historical, geographical, political, and cultural contexts of the respective countries. Measures specified in the various strategy documents include both structural (e. g. protective dams) and non-structural (e. g. regulatory and economic instruments) measures. An important development in defining measures is the recognition of ecosystems as an adaptation option, either restoration and preservation or as a green <b>infrastructural</b> <b>measure.</b> The strategy should include an implementation plan to guide the implementation of the strategy and a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan to be able to keep track of the implementation. The M&E plan is also needed to ensure that if the climate change effects differ from the initial projections, the planned measures can be adapted to the changes. For this reason, it is also recommended to regularly revise the strategy. The strategy should therefore be valid for a period of five to ten years. The report ends with an overview of conclusions and recommendations for the development of the Mekong Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan (MASAP) ...|$|R

40|$|Road {{authorities}} and police corpses {{in the province}} of Zuid-Holland gather data in many ways on a variety of traffic activities such as traffic counts, speed measurements, and alcohol controls. The Provincial Road Safety Board of Zuid-Holland would like to monitor the provincial road safety with this data. It would also like to estimate the effects of <b>infrastructural</b> and behaviour-influencing <b>measures</b> at certain locations. This could save money and efficiently allocate manpower. That is why the Zuid-Holland Board has taken the initiative of developing a Provincial Road Safety Data Network (PRSDN). SWOV, at their request, has made a design for this network. A PRSDN does not only contain an inventory of data from a network of measurements; it must also contain basic data such as crash data, road and traffic features, and data on specific measures. In addition, a PRSDN contains a 'policy instrument': a software instrument that processes the gathered data together with the basic data, to produce policy information. It can use a geographic information system (GIS) for specific locations or areas within the network to produce maps of the data and its processing. Theoretically, a policy instrument's result is an optimal package of road safety measures for specific locations. The criterion for an optimal package of measures is the cost-effectiveness. With regard to this, the PRSDN policy instrument also fits the method of SWOV's Regional Road Safety Explorer (RRSE). This can estimate the numbers of fatalities and in-patients for a given choice of measures, and compare them with the costs of these measures. In 2002, the RRSE played a role in determining the regional road safety targets. The calculation component of the RRSE {{should be part of the}} PRSDN policy instrument. In this study, the feasibility of a PRSDN was explored, with regard to the composition of the analysis databases, how the instrument works, and its utility for road safety policy. To do this, the method was further developed for use in a small pilot area in the new town of Zoetermeer. Attention was paid to data input in the policy instrument, and to data processing and presentation. These results were then compared with a list of general requirements and preconditions that such an instrument should meet. Finally, this report contains an advice for using the PRSDN on a larger scale, and the instrument development that is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this research}} project was to establish a sustainable urban water management design for Hoboken City to decrease vulnerability to extreme precipitation and improve urban quality. By carrying out a functional analysis of the area and the technical analysis of the water system, recommendations were made for soft and natural spatial solutions (i. e. blue-green measures). The base of the design is the existing urban environment, which is characterised by low area elevations, dense urban development, and high impermeability. The gravity based sewer system drains storm water into the Hudson River through combined sewer overflow valves. During high tide, the overflow valves close, preventing the storm water to overflow, whereby the surplus water remaining in the sewer pipes overflows in low-lying areas. Natural processes were used to recreate a naturally oriented water cycle. The main goals of the urban design were to reduce storm water floods, {{reduce the number of}} combined sewer overflows into the Hudson River, and improving the urban living environment. Urban quality was indicated by air quality, public green- and recreational space, and the reduction of urban heat island effects. The research question as a guide for the thesis reads: ‘What system of blue- green adaptation measures is most beneficial for Hoboken in terms of flood reduction and improving the urban quality?’ Various research methods are used to answer this question. To gain knowledge regarding urban water management and nature based flood adaptation measures, a literature review is conduced. tudies towards flooding and flood reduction in Hoboken were used as input for the water assignment. To design sets of blue-green measures, a functional analysis of the area is done using the six-layer approach for urban areas. With the approach, design opportunities and constraints for different layers are identified. The design strategies of appropriate blue-green measures for Hoboken are tested in a hydrology-hydraulic water management model. Results Hoboken suffers both flash flooding overwhelming the sewer system and storm surge. Low elevations and high groundwater levels influence infiltration capacity and efficiency of the drainage system. Combined sewer outlets with valves to the Hudson River carry excess water directly into the river during storms. When heavy rainfall coincides with high tide, excess water backs up in the sewer, causing flood nuisance in particular the low-lying areas. In terms of the required storage and drainage capacity, the water assignment for Hoboken is calculated. This technical assignment provides a rough measure of the required delay and storage capacity in urban areas for given rain events that exceed the existing storage and pumping capacity. With a basic hydrological model, the storage is determined on the basis of 100 years of precipitation data. The water assignment isn’t normative. It does not take detailed area characteristics, elevation profile and sewer layout into account and therefore cannot determine the locations where flooding occurs. With statistics afterwards, the storage volumes for 1, 2, 10 and 50 years design storms is determined. The table below shows the water assignment for these storm events. The volumes of water in the water assignment show the pressure on the current drainage system. During a T 1 storm event, the required storage capacity is already twice the available sewer storage of 8. 3 MG. For a T 10 the excessive volume is 40. 9 MG, corresponding to 62 Olympic swimming pools spread over the city. Based on the current storage capacity of 0. 5 inch/day, SDF curves show that for a T 10 storm, a pumping capacity of more than 15 inch per day would be needed. Due to interconnections, the calculated volumes per sub basin may differ from the actual volumes. Future regulations may require the North Hudson Sewerage Authority (NHSA), to reduce the flooding frequency on average once every 4 years or a T 4 return period (HobokenNJ, 2013). The preferred T 10 drainage capacity (5. 0 inch in 24 h) as set out in the US urban drainage design manual even corresponds with a required T 10 storage capacity. A number of blue-green adaptation measures have been selected for Hoboken based on site suitability. The six-layer approach, which integrates urban planning and subsoil characteristics, gives an overview of the opportunities and constraints for blue and green measures in the area. Well-fitting measures appeared to be subsurface detention storage in the higher elevated areas, storm water flow-through planters, (storm water infiltration) trees and permeable pavement in infrastructure. In public space, parks, water squares, green squares, detention below sports fields, open water and urban farming would fit well. The buildings in Hoboken found to be suitable for rainwater harvest tanks, blue- and green roofs, green facades and urban farming on rooftops. To maximize blue-green benefits, a citywide network of waterways, green areas, green streets and common gardens is proposed. Five design strategies were developed with combinations of blue-green measures, applied to different layers in the urban system. The first (1) design strategy improves the current situation with the application of subsurface adaptation measures. With a functional analysis, storage possibilities beneath parking lots and sports fields are determined. Two deep storage basins will are proposed. The remaining sports fields and parking lots will be equipped with shallow storage facilities. The second (2) design strategy improves the current situation with the application of <b>infrastructural</b> adaptation <b>measures.</b> This includes surface measures like permeable pavement, storm water infiltration planters and trees along major roads, and green in the streetscape. The third (3) design strategy applies adaptation measures on public space. Undeveloped public areas suitable to rain gardens, storm water trees and flow-through planters, water squares, detention below sport fields, parks, retention ponds (in new/existing green space), urban agriculture, bio retention swales, rainwater harvest cistern and seasonal storage are here for identified. For the fourth (4) design scenario, adaptation measures were applied on private space and buildings. Buildings suitable to place green roofs in the area are analysed. The fifth (5) strategy in the end, combines the proposed measures into an urban blue-green metabolism. Additional green is applied to the public space. Hollow roads discharge storm water towards open water bodies and green in the streetscape connects green area and open water in the city centre to green belt. The mitigation performance of every design strategy regarding the water assignment is tested {{on the basis of a}} Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The five design scenarios were added to the basic model by Low Impact Development controls (i. e. green roofs, permeable pavement, bio swales). To quantify the contribution of the design strategies to the water assignment, a number of criteria and parameters are identified. The criteria for design performance are (a) flood volume reduction during heavy rainfall events, (b) CSO reduction, (c) vulnerability reduction of critical public buildings and infrastructure (f. e. Hoboken terminal, hospitals, wastewater treatment plant, electricity distribution locations), and (d) improvement the urban quality of living. Four parameters to evaluate the to evaluate the contribution to flood mitigation and overflow reduction are (1) the flood volume in the drainage area (internal outflow), (2) the runoff per sub-basin, (3) the total storm water storage per sub-basin (excluding sewer storage), (4) critical facilities threatened by flash floods. All strategies showed contribution to flood volume reduction and creating urban quality, but not all strategies were as effective. Strategy 1 can store about 10 % of the total flood volume. It has the least contribution to urban quality, since only subsurface storage, and no vegetated measures were used. Strategy 2 on the other hand, has a very broad effect on the green experience of the city. It includes the greening of three major roads. Strategy 3 uses undeveloped space to create a green network throughout the city. It has the least effect on total flood reduction of all strategies, but uses space that would otherwise lie fallow. In strategy 4, green roofs are applied on all suitable buildings throughout the city. This had a positive effect on both flood reduction, reduction of the urban heat island effect, and air quality. When the roofs are large enough, they can even function as a roof garden, roof restaurant or private kitchen garden. Design strategy 5, the city-wide metabolism and people design strategy, combines all design strategies into a citywide system of blue-green measures. Modelling showed that Hoboken benefits most from this city-wide design strategy (5) in terms of quantitative flood reduction. This design strategy also has the most additional green through a citywide network of vegetated measures. The proposed spatial typology of the city-wide metabolism and people design strategy is elaborated with a number of illustrations. Green roofs, permeable pavement, bio-retention gardens, storage basins, an urban farm, urban wetlands and water squares are included in the adaptation design. Through the urban grid system, vegetated areas are connected to create a pleasant experience throughout the city. The riverbeds in the east and the areas at the bottom of the cliff are surrounding the city with a green belt. The green belt along the cliffs serves for both storage and infiltration of water. The three major roads with trees and plants create green veins through the heart of the city. In every part between the major roads parks, urban farms or wetlands can be found. A solid footpath or bicycle lane can be applied along the city borders to create an uninterrupted route. This citywide system of flood prevention measures provides a pleasant, physical appearance. Recommendations For future work, a number of suggestions can be presented towards the reliability and effectiveness of this study. To fill up data gaps in the current model, a follow up study regarding the costs and support of the proposed design is meaningful. The suggested design strategy 5 is the most extensive urban design is the most extensive one and therefor also the most costly. Historical research on blue-green measures resulted in implementation costs indications. These results need to be revised for the proposed design and with up to date financial taxes. Support for the design is needed when it comes to realisation. Inhabitants, businesses, landowners, the NJ transit and the governance are important stakeholders. Based on the outcome of this research, the improvement of the storm water management model is of biggest interest. Water Resources ManagementWater ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
