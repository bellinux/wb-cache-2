40|$|International audienceWelding of high {{strength}} steels containing martensite is difficult {{due to the}} appearance of brittle grains after fast cooling. Galvanizing spot-welded specimens made of AISI 410 solves this problem, and strongly improves the performances of spot welds. The mechanisms responsible for these achievements are presently analyzed. The changes of the mechanical strength and <b>fatigue</b> <b>toughness</b> of spot-welded samples made of AISI 410 after galvanizing have been studied. AISI 410 is a chromium-rich martensite. Tensile tests on normalized specimens indicate that the yield stress is close to 1010 MPa and the UTS at similar to 1270 MPa. The fatigue limit of raw AISI 410 is at 690 MPa (Delta sigma(L) at R= 0. 1). Specimens were cut following the rolling direction and spot-welded. Metallography reveals that spot welding produces: - hard martensite {{at the center of}} the nugget; - a heat affected zone, which has been forged by the welding electrodes and recrystallized at high temperature; - and finally, a ring of grains tempered in a subcritical temperature range. Spot welds were tested in tensile-shear mode. Both overload failure and <b>fatigue</b> <b>toughness</b> were evaluated. Annealing and galvanizing post-treatment have been used to improve the mechanical properties of the spot-welded specimens. The improvement of the mechanical performances of spot-welded specimens after post-treatments are reported as follows. First, we observed significant changes in the modes of rupture both in overload failure and fatigue tests. The mechanical strength of untreated spot welds is controlled by the brittleness of the nugget and the forged heat affected zone. After post-treatment, the ultimate tensile strength is increased, and rupture results from fissures propagating exclusively into the zone recrystallized in the subcritical range of temperature. This mode is genuine to spot welds in martensite because of the {{high strength}} of the base metal. Second, three modes of rupture depending on the force range control the <b>fatigue</b> <b>toughness.</b> Annealing and galvanizing modify the ranges. Galvanizing increases the endurance, and the fatigue limit by a factor similar to 3. 5. This effect is attributed to zinc brazing that strongly changes the distribution of stresses under tensile-shear solicitation. Hardness measurements and tensile test on specific samples clarify the mechanical behavior of the layers around the spot, and shed some light on the mechanisms of rupture.

Two types of TC 4 alloy experiments are conducted for the study on the damage accumulation law. All the parameters in the nonlinear damage model are obtained by the tension–compression fatigue tests, and {{the accuracy of the}} nonlinear damage model is verified by the damage tests. The strength degeneration model is put forward {{on the basis of the}} Chaboche nonlinear damage theory and the Griffith fracture criterion, and determined by measuring the <b>fatigue</b> <b>toughness</b> during the tests. From the comparison of two kinds of degeneration models based on the Miner’s linear law and the nonlinear damage model respectively, the nonlinear model has a significant advantage on prediction accuracy especially in the later period of life. A time-dependent SSI reliability model is established. By computing the stress distribution using the finite element (FE) technique, the reliability of a single blade during the whole service life is obtained. Considering the failure correlation of components, a modified reliability model of aero-engine blades with common cause failure (CCF) is presented.

These tests were stopped whenever a compliance change was observed, at which point the specimens were removed from the test fixture and ultrasonically inspected. The specimens were then re-turned to the ENF fixture for additional testing, and the process repeated.

In order to understand fatigue life discrepancy in {{titanium alloy}}, previous studies were performed. They have emphasised the role of a crystallographic macro-structure, constituted by clusters of millimetre and centimetre sizes, on micro-cracks initiation on TA 6 V [1]. The macro-structure of the alloys was assumed to be correlated with the ex-β grains. Moreover, according to other authors, specific texture of the β phase improves <b>fatigue</b> <b>toughness</b> on Ti 17 [2]. In order to understand the role of the as-received material initial microstructure and texture and the effects of the forging process in β phase (T>Tβ) on macro-zones formation, a numerical simulation of the process has been undertaken, allowing us to follow the evolution of the crystallographic texture and morphology for different deformation rates.

This paper presents the results of the investigations on a wear resistant coating made by alternate layers of TiN and Ti(CxN 1 -x) (nominal 0. 5 mum each), deposited on S 600 tool steel by reactive cathodic arc evaporation using a reactive gaseous mixture of methane and nitrogen. Microstructural and compositional characterisation were carried out using ball crater tests, Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy associated with Energy Dispersive Microanalysis and Image Analysis. Micro hardness measurement were evaluated by means of the Chicot and Lesage volume law of mixture model to cope with the problem of the multiple influence of the different layers and the substrate on the real multilayer surface hardness. In order to predict the surface hardness, the model needs the knowledge of the properties of each type of layers and of the substrate (Young modulus, H- 0 = hardness at infinitely small load and n = strain hardening coefficient, or ISE index), These properties were measured using microindentation tests from ad hoc samples of single TiN 0. 5 Vm layer film., single Ti(CxN 1 -x) 0. 5 mum layer film and the uncoated substrate. Young modulus for the TiN and TiCN were evaluated with load-displacement nanoindentation tests; Young modulus for the substrate is from manufacturer. Thickness, composition profiles and microstructure of each film were used to qualify the data input for the model.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of dissertation: DEVELOPMENT OF A PERFORMANCE BASED, INTEGRATED DESIGN/SELECTION MIXTURE METHODOLOGY FOR FIBER REINFORCED CONCRETE AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS Stewart David Bennie, Doctor of Philosophy, 2004 Dissertation {{directed}} by: Professor Dimitrios G. Goulias Department of Civil Engineering Recent {{advances in}} polymer technology have {{given rise to}} new research regarding conventional building materials like concrete and the rheological material properties of polymer fiber-concrete composites. Polymers such as polypropylene fiber are now the industry standard for manufacture of geosynthetics which are used as the structural element in earth walls, stabilized slopes, and to improve soft soil bearing capacity. Both industry and researchers now recognize the benefits of polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete in reducing temperature and shrinkage cracking and crack widths, which is important distress criteria in airfield pavements. However, little attention has been given to the use of high tensile strength polypropylene as a structural component of concrete pavements. As important as the research, is the methodology used to obtain the results. There is a need to consider concrete mixture design and selection in conjunction with pavement design since specific mixture properties' behavior and performance characteristics are set by pavement design requirements. Such approach will permit the development of an "integrated mixture selection- pavement design methodology". This study quantified the beneficial strength properties of small volume (less than 0. 5 %) polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) as an airfield pavement to meet both military and civilian aviation needs. Polypropylene fiber reinforcement in small volumes displays none of the historical problems of poor workability, or excessive pavement deflections associated with fiber-concrete composites in larger volumes. Through laboratory testing of material properties such as <b>fatigue,</b> <b>toughness</b> and flexural strength and computer modeling this composite showed a consistent improvement in those strength properties that would increase the life of the pavement structure under repetitive aircraft traffic. Perhaps, the most unique property of this composite is its ability to continue to absorb energy after first crack, ductile properties not typically associated with a brittle material like concrete. This increase in toughness is significant to the military in mitigating heaved pavement around bomb damaged runway craters during rapid runway repair. Analogues to safety glass, FRC will mitigate radial fracturing of airfield pavement located around the crater impact area reducing time to repair heaved pavement, an important criteria to air base survivability.

The system concept for the vary high temperature reactor (VHTR) can be a reactor based on the prismatic block of the GT-MHR developed by a consortium led by General Atomics in the U.

This report has made a preliminary assessment on the issues pertaining to the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) for the NGNP. Two IHX designs namely, shell and tube and compact heat exchangers were considered in the assessment. Printed circuit heat exchanger, among various compact heat exchanger (HX) designs, was selected for the analysis. Irrespective of the design, the material considerations {{for the construction of}} the HX are essentially similar, except may be in the fabrication of the units. As a result, we have reviewed in detail the available information on material property data relevant for the construction of HX and made a preliminary assessment of several relevant factors to make a judicious selection of the material for the IHX. The assessment included four primary candidate alloys namely, Alloy 617 (UNS N 06617), Alloy 230 (UNS N 06230), Alloy 800 H (UNS N 08810), and Alloy X (UNS N 06002) for the IHX. Some of the factors addressed in this report are the tensile, creep, fatigue, creep <b>fatigue,</b> <b>toughness</b> properties for the candidate alloys, thermal aging effects on the mechanical properties, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code compliance information, and performance of the alloys in helium containing a wide range of impurity concentrations.

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials have been {{commonly used in}} aerospace engineering, because of their good mechanical properties and attractive potential for creating lightweight structures. Susceptibility to delamination {{is one of the}} most important issues in the applications of these materials. This disadvantage can prohibit the application of {{composite materials}} in primary aerospace structures and limit their lightweight potential. Therefore, characterizing fatigue delamination growth behavior in composite laminates is important for the applications of these materials in aerospace, as it provides the necessary information for the damage tolerance design philosophy. Fibre bridging is an important shielding mechanism during delamination growth in composite laminates. It can increase the fracture toughness by restraining the crack opening and inhibit delamination growth. However, there is no reliable method to take into account of its contribution to fatigue delamination growth. Thus, investigation of this phenomenon and development of a prediction method is required. The objective of this investigation is to study mode I fatigue delamination growth with fibre bridging in composite laminates and provide physics-based interpretations of fatigue delamination growth. Two approaches are applied to interpret the fatigue delamination growth behavior according to different perspectives. In the engineering perspective, the Paris relation is applied. However, in the physics-based perspective, energy principles are used. The bridging effect on fatigue delamination growth is first investigated by a series of fatigue tests. The Paris relation is used to interpret the fatigue data. It demonstrates that fibre bridging can significantly decrease the fatigue crack growth rate, making it invalid to use a single fatigue resistance curve to determine fatigue delamination with bridging. A new method, still based on the Paris relation, is developed to predict fatigue delamination growth with fibre bridging, by correlating the curve fitting parameters with the amount of bridging fibres. Fatigue delamination growth is physically explained according to the energy conservation law. It is found that bridging fibres periodically store and release strain energy upon loading and unloading cycles. However, they have no contribution to the real strain energy release, unless the bridging fibre pullout or fails. This can lead to the invalidity of using the strain energy release rate (SERR) determined by the fixed grip assumption for quasi-static crack growth to interpret fatigue crack growth. Therefore, the SERR commonly used is not a suitable similitude parameter to determine fatigue delamination growth. Energy principles are subsequently used to interpret the stress ratio effect in fatigue delamination growth. A concept of <b>fatigue</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> is proposed to describe the steady fatigue delamination growth, in which little or no bridging fibre pullout or failure occurs. Therefore, all energy dissipation in the steady delamination growth is concentrated on the new crack generation. The <b>fatigue</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> is observed to be interface configuration independent but significantly stress ratio dependent. The mechanisms related to this are interpreted by fractographic observation. Using the concept of <b>fatigue</b> fracture <b>toughness,</b> the stress ratio effect on fatigue delamination growth can be explained with a clear physical background.
