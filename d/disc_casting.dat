40|$|Context. The disc {{around the}} Herbig Ae/Be star HD 100546 {{is one of}} the most {{extensively}} studied discs in the southern sky. Although there is a wealth of information about its dust content and composition, not much is known about its gas and large-scale kinematics. Many recent results have stressed the importance of studying both the gas and dust in discs. (12) CO is an excellent gas tracer in the submillimetre, and the intensity ratio between lines originating from low and high rotational levels probes the gas temperature. Emerging submillimetre facilities in the Southern hemisphere allow us to characterise the gas and dust content in objects like HD 100546 better. Aims. Our aim is to establish whether the disc is gas-rich and to study the disc temperature and kinematics. Methods. We detected and studied the molecular gas in the disc at spatial resolution from 7. '' 7 to 18. '' 9 using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope(star). We observed the lines (12) CO J = 7 - 6, J = 6 - 5, J = 3 - 2, (13) CO J = 3 - 2 and [C I] (3) P(2) -(3) P(1), as diagnostics of disc temperature, size, chemistry, and kinematics. We use parametric disc models that reproduce the low-J (12) CO emission from Herbig Ae stars and we vary the basic disc parameters - temperature, mass, and size. With the help of a molecular excitation and radiative transfer code we fit the observed spectral line profiles. Results. Our observations are consistent with more than 10 (- 3) M(circle dot) of molecular gas in a disc of approximate to 400 AU radius in Keplerian rotation around a 2. 5 M(circle dot) star, seen at an inclination of 50 degrees. The detected (12) CO lines are dominated by gas at 30 - 70 K. Not detecting the [C I] line indicates excess ultraviolet emission above that of a B 9 type model stellar atmosphere. Asymmetry in the (12) CO line emission suggests that one side of the outer disc is colder by 10 - 20 K than the other. A plausible scenario is a warped geometry in the inner <b>disc</b> <b>casting</b> a partial shaddow on the outer disc. We exclude pointing offsets, foreground cloud absorption, and asymmetry in the disc extent as possible causes of the observed line asymmetry. Conclusions. Efficient heating of the outer disc by the star HD 100546 ensures that low-and high-J (12) CO lines are dominated by the outermost disc regions, indicating a 400 AU radius. The (12) CO J = 6 - 5 line arises from a disc layer higher than disc midplane, and warmer by 15 - 20 K than the layer emitting the J = 3 - 2 line. The existing models of discs around Herbig Ae stars, asuming a B 9. 5 type model stellar atmosphere, overproduce the [CI] (3) P(2) -(3) P(1) line intensity from HD 100546 by an order of magnitude...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} a {{continuous}} investigation of the roles played by the tribofilm on dry automotive clutch system performance. Tribological experiments were performed {{by the addition of}} wear debris at the beginning of tribometer tests and by reducing the surface roughness of a cast iron counter-face. The initial surface conditions of <b>cast</b> <b>discs</b> were 0. 2 and 1. 2 µm. The pin-on-disc tests were carried out at three different PV levels: 3. 08, 7. 88, and 10. 09 MPa·ms− 1, and the current results were correlated to those previously obtained in the standard tribometer procedure. When the wear debris was added into the tribosystem, the friction coefficient level dropped drastically while the assembly wear rate rose. In contrast, the modified <b>cast</b> <b>discs</b> provided a reduced wear rate of assembly and a higher and more stable friction coefficient level. These improvements were obtained in a severe condition where higher temperature levels were reached. For the tests with added debris, SEM observations revealed a more intense tribofilm development over the worn surfaces of the clutch friction material. The smoothest <b>cast</b> <b>disc</b> did not damage the developed tribofilms and maintained them more stably due to a reduction in contact area stresses at the highest tribometer test...|$|R

40|$|Shape-from-shading is a {{ubiquitous}} cue informing {{object identification}} and depth judgements. Cast-shadows contribute towards these judgements (see Mammassian, Knill and Kersten, 1998). A {{number of studies}} have reported that search-times for inconsistent shadows vary according to whether the scene is presented as-if illuminated from above or below. Though the direction of these inhomogeneities is sometimes contested (see Rensink and Cavanagh, 2004 and Lovell et al, 2009). Lovell et. al. posit that the processing of shadows is handled by coarse-scale processes, but only in light-from-above presentations. The current study explores depth discrimination judgements informed by cast shadows. We create stimuli featuring a pair of floating <b>discs,</b> <b>casting</b> shadows onto a fronto-parallel surface. Participants were asked to identify the disc protruding the most towards them. One disc featured a cast-shadow with a cue-conflict, where low and high spatial-frequency components conveyed different depth information. This allowed us to estimate the weight assigned to the different cues when depth discrimination judgements were made. Firstly, we find that depth judgements consistently reflected the coarse-scale cues, fine-scale cues were largely ignored. Secondly, we found only small differences in the cue weightings for stimuli presented as-if light were above or below. The latter result is perplexing as previous studies have shown a difference between light-from-above and below conditions. We speculate that this difference reflects the task undertaken, i. e. discriminating depths rather than searching for odd shadows...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{evaluation of}} the coefficient of friction characterising a friction couple comprising a commercial brake <b>disc</b> <b>cast</b> of flake graphite grey iron and a typical brake pad for passenger motor car. For the applied interaction conditions, the brake pressure of 0. 53 MPa and the linear velocity measured on the pad-disc trace axis equalling 15 km/h, evolution of the friction coefficient μ values were observed. It turned out that {{after a period of}} 50 minutes, temperature reached the value 270 °C and got stabilised. After this time interval, the friction coefficient value also got stabilised on the level of μ = 0. 38. In case of a block in its original state, stabilisation of the friction coefficient value occurred after a stage in the course of which a continuous growth of its value was observed up to the level μ = 0. 41 and then a decrease to the value μ = 0. 38. It can be assumed that occurrence of this stage was an effect of an initial running-in of the friction couple. In consecutive abrasion tests on the same friction couple, the friction coefficient value stabilisation occurred after the stage of a steady increase of its value. It can be stated that the stage corresponded to a secondary running-in of the friction couple. The observed stages lasted for similar periods of time and ended with reaching the stabile level of temperature of the disc-pad contact surface...|$|R

40|$|This work aims to {{investigate}} the effect of two different counterdisc materials, i. e. gray cast iron (GCI) and ductile gray cast iron (DGCI) on tribo behavior of non-commercial frictional materials (NF 1, NF 2, NF 4, and NF 5) and two other chosen commercial brake pads (CMA and CMB) under dry sliding contact conditions. The four non-commercial frictional materials were fabricated with various percentages of phenolic binder resin (15 and 20 vol. %) and reinforced with steel fibers (15 and 20 vol. %) using hot press molding methods. Tribo tests were carried out using a small-scale tribo-tester of pad-on-disc type. Friction coefficient and wear of non-commercial and commercial brake pads were measured against each counterdisc (GCI and DGCI) and compared. Then, the friction and wear characteristic are discussed by comparing the experimental results obtained for each kind of cast iron. The results showed that maximum friction coefficient (0. 4 – 0. 5) of brake pad was attained at 2. 22 MPa applied pressure and 2. 1 m/s sliding speed when the frictional brake pad materials were tested against DGCI disc rotor. Meanwhile, similar wear rates for all frictional brake pad materials were sustained at higher applied pressure and sliding speed when tested against either type of rotor discs (GCI and DGCI). The results on the other hand, indicated that non-commercial materials NF 1 and NF 4, gave better wear resistance compared to other frictional pad materials. NF 2 exhibited the lowest wear resistance when tested against GCI and DGCI rotor disc at all applied pressure and sliding speeds.

40|$|Background and Aim: Replacing {{fractured}} ceramometal restorations may be {{the best}} treatment option, but it is costly. Many different bonding systems are currently available to repair the fractured ceramometal restorations. This study compared the shear bond strength of composite to a base metal alloy using 4 bonding systems. Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, fifty <b>discs,</b> <b>casted</b> in a Ni-Cr-Be base metal alloy (Silvercast, Fulldent),were ground with 120, 400 and 600 grit sandpaper and divided equally into 5 groups receiving 5 treatments for veneering. Conventional feldspathic porcelain (Ceramco 2, Dentsply Ceramco) was applied on control group (PFM or group 1) and the remaining metal discs were air- abraded for 15 seconds with 50 mm aluminum oxide at 45 psi and washed for 5 seconds under tap water. Then the specimens were dried by compressed air and the&nbsp; groups were treated with one of the bonding systems as follows: All-Bond 2 (AB), Ceramic Primer (CP), Metal Primer II (MP) and Panavia F 2 (PF). An opaque composite (Foundation opaque) followed by a hybrid composite (Gradia Direct) was placed on the treated metal surface and light cured separately. Specimens were stored in distilled water at 370 C and thermocycled prior to shear strength testing. Fractured specimens were evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed with one way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests. P&lt; 0. 05 was considered as the level of significance. Results: Mean shear bond strengths of the groups in MPa were as follows: PFM group 38. 6 &plusmn; 2, All-Bond 2 17. 06 &plusmn; 2. 85, Ceramic Primer 14. 72 &plusmn; 1. 2, Metal Primer II 19. 04 &plusmn; 2. 2 and Panavia F 2 21. 37 &plusmn; 2. 1. PFM group exhibited the highest mean shear bond strength and Ceramic Primer showed the lowest. Tukey's HSD test revealed the mean bond strength of the PFM group to be significantly higher than the other groups (P&lt; 0. 001). The data for the PF group was significantly higher than AB and CP groups (P&lt; 0. 05) and the shear bond strength of the MP group was higher than CP group, but was not significantly different from AB (P&gt; 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, the most reliable treatment for fractured metal-ceramic restorations would be the replacement of the restoration. If this is not possible, adhesive resin cements containing filler and phosphate-based monomers (especially MDP) such as Panavia F 2 could be recommended for bonding composite to base metal alloys...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{drive toward}} higher operating efficiency, greater reliability and longer life of steam turbines {{has introduced a}} need for higher integrity components to operate at higher temperatures and pressures. This poses several material and processing challenges {{to ensure that the}} components have metallurgical stability and the required mechanical properties in the high temperature environment. Modelling the open-die press forging process, used to manufacture steam turbine <b>discs</b> from <b>cast</b> ingots, is complex due to the variation of strain, strain rate and temperature within the ingot. These variations mean that recrystallisation and grain growth do not occur uniformly throughout the ingot. Severe plastic deformation is used to promote recrystallisation in order to refine the grain size and improve strength and toughness properties. A major part of the modelling described in this paper involves prediction and validation of strain, strain rate and temperature distributions during open-die forging. A sensitivity study has confirmed the requirement for accurate thermal and physical data such as Interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (IHTC), work-piece emissivity, specific heat and friction coefficient. In this paper experimental determination of these data for the grade of heat resistant steel being modelled, over process parameter ranges appropriate to open-die forging operations, is described. Incorporation of these data into a finite element-based model for strain variation within an ingot is reported with consideration and measurement of dead zone for thermo-mechanical simulation trials...|$|R

40|$|A well {{designed}} runner and feeding system should produce castings with minimal defects and low pour weight. This thesis investigates how the filling regime and solidification of the mould influences defects in the castings produced from that mould. Design guidelines to reduce such defects are proposed and tested. An existing shrinkage fault in a Grey Iron <b>disc</b> brake <b>casting</b> is simulated using a commercial finite-difference computer program. Three criteria {{are used to}} predict the defect {{and the effect of}} changes to the feeder geometry. Critical Fraction Solidification analysis is used to determine whether the feeder remains in liquid contact with the casting during solidification and this approach is shown to correctly predict {{the presence or absence of}} porosity* The feeder block is extended below the ingate of the casting to improve liquid contact between the casting and feeder without significantly increasing the feeder mass. Plant trials confirm the change to the feeder eliminates the porosity defect. The runner system and mould venting for a thin walled Ductile Iron casting are investigated. Trials show that by setting the total mould vent area to be greater than the net ingate area of the castings, the cold-shut frequency is halved. A method for runner system design based on peak linear flow velocity in the runner during mould filling is proposed. A new pressurised runner system produces castings with significantly fewer defects and reduced pour weight when runner areas are designed to maintain peak velocity below 1 m/s. Peak velocity and magnesium levels are demonstrated to be critical factors in the elimination of cold-shut defects. A pressurised runner system is also shown to isolate inclusion defects from castings more effectively than an unpressurised system. From this work, a technique is proposed which allows the yield of an existing runner and feeder system for iron castings to be improved with confidence in the results...|$|R

Both the IBDs and PDCs are designed for “high wear” applications with necessary resistance of tools such as in coal mining, machining of materials, oil drilling and others. IBD has a cutting capacity and wear resistance far exceeding current cemented tungsten carbide materials. In previous research, a series of specifically designed IBD composites {{have been found to}} exceed the standards of toughness and wear resistance in mining and oil drilling applications, but no systematic research has been done to compare the friction, wear, and toughness properties of IBDs and PDCs. This research project compared selected properties and performance levels of IBD and PDC samples. During impact testing, samples were subjected to impact energies of up to 125 J in order to examine the fundamental differences in the fracture mechanisms using Scanning Electron Microscopy. During friction and wear testing, sample edges were pressed against rotating <b>discs</b> of <b>cast</b> iron, steel, and granite in order to analyze and compare the mechanisms of friction and wear of IBDs and PDCs. Results show that PDCs outperform IBDs in “smooth wear” testing, but IBD is superior in impact resistance and “impact wear” testing. Several industries are currently interested in licensing this promising new material, and this research is a key component for the future applications of IBDs...|$|R
40|$|A {{test method}} has been {{developed}} to evaluate the friction and wear behaviour of cylinder liner and piston ring materials for four stroke engine system. Realistic engine oils are {{used to describe the}} behaviour of this test method. The friction and wear experiments were performed using pin-on-disc tribo tester. The effect of lubricants and load conditions are important aspects of this test method and are focus of this work. The test uses actual piston ring segments sliding on the <b>disc</b> of grey <b>cast</b> iron used in cylinder liners. A wide range of commercial lubricants including SAE 10 W 30, SAE 20 W 40 and SAE 20 W 50 were used to analyze frictional and wear behaviour. Tests were conducted for constant load at 140 N for 105 min and increment load with the range from 20 N to 140 N for 105 min to evaluate the behaviour of frictional force and wear for cylinder liner and piston ring. Relative amount of wear is directly correlate with the effectiveness of the lubricant due to this wear was measured by weight loss before and after testing. Result shows that viscosity and variation of load plays a vital role to characterize the behaviour of frictional force and wear...|$|R
