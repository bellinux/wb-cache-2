5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Murray cod {{caught and}} {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs {{and do not}} spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the angle {{reported by the}} phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
5|$|The real <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it moves}} the moral center more towards the obscene. That {{it becomes more}} normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
50|$|The only {{remaining}} <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of causation.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Act {{required}} the {{keeping of records}} to verify compliance; the appellee argued that this violated his Fifth Amendment right protecting him from self-incrimination.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for April 1926. It has {{from the}} outset been {{published}} by Asahi Shinbun-sha, publisher of the newspaper Asahi Shinbun. The headquarters is in Tokyo.|$|R
25|$|A key <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> vegans who {{consumed}} L-carnitine did {{not produce}} TMAO {{because they did not}} have the intestinal bacteria that produce TMA from carnitine.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the complex}} numbers the {{definite}} integral (for negative values of n and x) {{can be defined}} via contour integration, but then depends on choice of path, specifically winding number – the geometric <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the function defines a covering space with a singularity at0.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Peeters {{directive}} {{stipulates that}} the language of administration and local public services should at all times be Dutch, the only official language of the concerned municipalities. It is obligatory to speak Dutch in meetings of the municipal council and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to find {{solution}} and help better the problems we have to acknowledge and learn to notice the problem before throwing the kids into a class that will not help for improvement.There is an ongoing list of different <b>issues.</b> There <b>are</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> small but there <b>are</b> other <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> so very difficult and unbearable.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Virginia's cession to the United States {{declared}} the river, not {{a bank of}} the river, to be the proper boundary. In a major statement about interstate boundaries, Marshall declared: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{main reason}} <b>that</b> halfpennies <b>were</b> <b>issued</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when shillings <b>were</b> decimalised they were worth five new pence, so a sixpence (half of a shilling) yielded {{a value of}} [...] new pence.|$|R
25|$|Another {{possible}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> {{although the}} Alcubierre metric {{is consistent with}} Einstein's equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics. Some physicists have presented arguments {{to suggest that a}} theory of quantum gravity (which would incorporate both theories) would eliminate those solutions in general relativity that allow for backwards time travel (see the chronology protection conjecture) and thus make the Alcubierre drive invalid.|$|E
25|$|Home-schooling {{is legal}} in India, {{though it is}} the less {{explored}} option. The Indian Government's stance on the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> parents are free to teach their children at home, {{if they wish to}} and have the means.The then HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere.|$|E
25|$|One more <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some complex {{instructions}} {{are difficult to}} restart, e.g. following a page fault. In some cases, restarting from the beginning will work (although wasteful), {{but in many cases}} this would give incorrect results. Therefore, the machine needs to have some hidden state to remember which parts went through and what remains to be done. With a load/store machine, the program counter is sufficient to describe the state of the machine.|$|E
50|$|Basically, the <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such {{offenders}} may {{not actually}} have the blameworthy intent for a legal finding {{of guilt and}} may, therefore, be punished based on intoxication, rather than for commission of a crime.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Grand Theft Auto III was released, {{which started}} the {{controversy}} over again. The main <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the graphics had advanced much, which made the game {{seem to have a}} greater potential impact.|$|R
50|$|A major <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the complex}} lacked {{emergency}} exits and efficient fire protection systems. The {{architect of the}} complex and several municipal public servants responsible for the overseeing of commercial buildings were prosecuted as well.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} of string {{theory is that the}} full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the theory is thought to describe an enormous landscape of possible universes, and this has complicated efforts to develop theories of particle physics based on string theory. These issues have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to physics and question the value of continued research on string theory unification.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative priming only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative priming effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> negative priming effects {{have been found to}} be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative priming questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.|$|E
25|$|Although radial {{velocity}} of the star only gives a planet's minimum mass, if the planet's spectral lines can be distinguished from the star's spectral lines then the {{radial velocity}} of the planet itself can be found, and this gives the inclination of the planet's orbit. This enables measurement of the planet's actual mass. This also rules out false positives, and also provides data about {{the composition of the}} planet. The main <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such detection is possible only if the planet orbits around a relatively bright star and if the planet reflects or emits a lot of light.|$|E
50|$|Sometime {{during the}} 1960s, Treasure Chest {{began to be}} {{published}} by T.S. Dennison. The final <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of July 1972. Pflaum also published the magazines Junior Catholic Messenger, Our Little Messenger, and Young Catholic Messenger.|$|R
25|$|The Post Office {{issued a}} 4¢ Madison stamp on July 1, 1938, {{part of the}} Presidential <b>Issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>issued</b> <b>that</b> year. The {{engraving}} of Madison on this <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> modeled after a bust by Frederick William Sievers {{on display in the}} State Capitol building in Richmond, Virginia.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{two major}} issues that played {{out through a}} design project. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> developing strategies <b>that</b> promote community through design. The second <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of sustainable development and building methods. The project consists of the design and development of an apartment complex that incorporates the issues of community and sustainability. Three different building scales were investigated: the unit, the cluster, and the site. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. Arch. ...|$|R
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the real <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E
25|$|Within the Orthodox Jewish {{community}} {{the concept}} is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Regarding laws of sexuality, religious challenges include masturbation (which may be regarded as “seed wasting”), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation (niddah) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father’s identity is determined by a legal presumption (chazakah) of legitimacy: rov bi'ot achar ha'baal - a woman's sexual relations {{are assumed to be}} with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father. Reform Judaism has generally approved IVF.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} {{issues that have}} risen from the {{controversy}} {{is the issue of}} blood lineage and government records in regards to determining tribal membership. Historians have noted that before the Dawes Commission, the Cherokee have included people from previous rolls and people of non-Cherokee descent as members of the nation, from former captives to members by adoption. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes, two non-Cherokee tribes, are members of the Cherokee Nation via the Delaware Agreement of 1867 and the Shawnee Agreement of 1869. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a tribe's breaking a treaty protected by Article Six of the United States Constitution. Daniel F. Littlefield Jr., director of the Sequoyah Research Center at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, stated that the Treaty of 1866 granted freedmen their rights as citizens, and the case should not be made into a racial issue.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} both these <b>issues</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some 603.97x engined cars had engine problems. While never {{formally}} recalled, Daimler-Benz replaced some engines under warranty, even somewhat {{after the original}} warranty term expired (at least for the original owner).|$|R
50|$|In 2010, at {{a seminar}} {{held by the}} Christian Council of Thailand, <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> raised {{involving}} Thai soap operas and the television rating system. The most notable <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> Thai soap operas are broadcast {{early in the day}} and may including content unsuitable for children, such as graphic or violent sexual assault scenes.|$|R
50|$|Another troubling <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the patents had {{two years}} to run, so <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{unlikely}} <b>that</b> the final judgment could occur during {{the life of the}} patents. Some justices wondered whether it was worthwhile to decide the case in light of this factor.|$|R
25|$|Colaprete et al. {{conducted}} simulations {{with the}} Mars General Circulation Model which {{show that the}} local climate around the Martian south pole may currently be in an unstable period. The simulated instability {{is rooted in the}} geography of the region, leading the authors to speculate that the sublimation of the polar ice is a local phenomenon rather than a global one. The researchers showed that even with a constant solar luminosity the poles were capable of jumping between states of depositing or losing ice. The trigger for a change of states could be either increased dust loading in the atmosphere or an albedo change due to deposition of water ice on the polar cap. This theory is somewhat problematic {{due to the lack of}} ice depositation after the 2001 global dust storm. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the accuracy of the Mars General Circulation Model decreases as the scale of the phenomenon becomes more local.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} Pakistan's {{opposition}} to India's {{entry into the}} Organization of Islamic Cooperation {{is due to the}} human rights issues and problems faced by the Kashmiris in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir(J). The Muslim world has always supported Pakistan rather than India, however the role of the OIC concerning the Kashmir <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> India has the largest Muslim minority and those people have shown desire to join the OIC. While the First Islamic Summit did not have the issue of the Kashmir people, granting the 60 million Muslims living in India membership in the OIC was discussed. While General Yayha Khan of Pakistan did agree, he showed his extreme displeasure at the fact that at induction of Muslim representative Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad, he took a seat, which caused major controversy. Meanwhile, there were Muslims killed in anti-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad. Pakistan rejected this development and demanded the expulsion of India from the summit.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{development}} of the Nash equilibrium concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. They have proposed many related solution concepts (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not 'credible'. In 1965 Reinhard Selten proposed subgame perfect equilibrium as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on non-credible threats. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is repeated, or what happens if a game is played in the absence of complete information. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: all equilibrium concepts analyze what choices will be made when each player takes into account the decision-making of others.|$|E
30|$|Although it is {{advantageous}} to achieve sophisticated analysis there exist several serious privacy {{issues of the}} data-mining-as-a-service paradigm. One of the main <b>issues</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the server has access to valuable data of the owner and may learn sensitive information from it.|$|R
5000|$|Mabele was in {{fact the}} target of a march in 2004 when more than 500 {{traditional}} healers marched to give her a petition against the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). The <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> TAC <b>was</b> only promoting ARVs and not traditional medicine.|$|R
50|$|Armored cars {{did indeed}} prove useful in open land {{such as in}} deserts, but were {{not very good at}} {{crossing}} obstacles (e.g. trenches, barriers) or in more challenging terrain. The other <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> very hard to add much protection or armament.|$|R
