40|$|The {{line pipe}} forming {{operation}} {{can be divided}} into two parts, first is to achieve the required shape in terms of curvature and ovality after formation of the line pipe. The curvature and ovality ultimately affects the final dimensional controls at the later stage i. e. after mechanical expansion of the line pipe. The second part is to make right welding joint geometry to make the final long seam weld of line pipe. The welding joint geome-try ultimately controls soundness of final seam weld at later stage i. e. during submerged arc welding of the line pipe. As far as curvature or shape of line pipe is concerned, important operation is making the required curvature along the edges of TMCP and ACC (Thermo mechanical controlled processing and accelerated cooling process) plate for line pipe (Plate <b>Edge</b> <b>Crimping</b> press) up to the 150 mm in width minimum and forming of the line pipe at J-C-O press. The selection of dies with proper hardness and curvature in both the operation plays a vital role in the formation of line pipes. The main parameters of selection dies (Tools) are size of line pipe for which dies/tools are to be made i. e. the diameter of line pipe, thickness of line pipe and most important is grade of line pipe (Strength level). The grade or strength level decides amount of spring back behavior of the steel Plate. The spring back behavior again varies from steel mill to steel mill in the same grade of HR plate. This is because the each steel mill has its own manufacturing procedures to produc...|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [61077031]The {{stress state}} of crimped {{pultruded}} composite rods subjected to traction {{has been investigated}} analytically using the linear theory of elasticity of anisotropic body and the superposition principle. The theoretical solution is able to reproduce the finite element analysis results and clarify {{the relation between the}} stress state and the boundary stresses. It can be appreciated from the theoretical solution that a longitudinal compressive stress at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>crimping</b> zone is generated by the boundary shear stress induced by the flow of metal end-fitting. Thus it can be deduced that the stress concentration at the <b>edge</b> of <b>crimping</b> zone could be mitigated through appropriately increasing the extent of the flow of the metal end-fitting away {{from the middle of the}} crimping zone. Our research shows that a radial tensile stress existing at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>crimping</b> zone is corresponding to the area of the rod that axial splitting is taken place. Comparison between analytical and numerical results shows the analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical ones except for stress distribution at the edge of the loading zone. The detailed study on stress state at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>crimping</b> zone provides better understanding of the failure mechanism, the improvement possibilities on the crimping technique and the monitoring of the structural health of the composite rod.

They also produced deep shades of amethyst glass, some so dark they appeared black. [...] They were also known for deep <b>crimped</b> <b>edges.</b> They also produced Iridescent Frit Glass. The Dugan Pompeian, Venetian, and Japanese glass lines were examples of frit glass. These pieces were rolled in glass frit, which is ground up pieces of glass, and then shaped by hand.|$|R
5000|$|Bridies {{are said}} [...] "to have been 'invented' by a Forfar baker in the 1850s". The name may {{refer to the}} pie's {{frequent}} presence on wedding menus, or to Margaret Bridie of Glamis, [...] "who sold them at the Buttermarket in Forfar". They are similar to pasties, {{but because they are}} made without potatoes, are much lighter in texture. Bakers in Forfar traditionally use shortcrust pastry for their bridies, but in the rest of Scotland, flaky pastry is preferred. The filling of a bridie consists of minced steak, butter, and beef suet seasoned with salt and pepper. It is sometimes made with minced onions. Before being baked, the bridie's filling is placed on pastry dough, which is then folded into a semi-circular or triangular shape; finally, the <b>edges</b> are <b>crimped.</b> If the baker pokes one hole in the top of a bridie, this indicates that it is plain, or without onions; two holes means that it does contain onions.|$|R

These pockets and edges can range from large jug holds to micro <b>crimp</b> <b>edges.</b> When used effectively they can facilitate huge gains in forearm strength and lock off strength, mostly in the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles of the fore arms. They are also an apparatus with the capability to injure the user, usually in the A1-4 pulleys or along sections of flexor carpi sheath linking the different FDS or FDP sections in the forearm.|$|R
50|$|Sweet Flag is a {{perennial}} herb, 30 to 100 cm tall. In habit it resembles the Iris. It consists of tufts of basal leaves that rise from a spreading rhizome. The leaves are erect yellowish-green, radical, with pink sheathing at their bases, sword-shaped, flat and narrow, tapering into a long, acute point, and have parallel veins. The leaves have smooth edges, {{which can be}} wavy or crimped. The sweet flag can easily be distinguished from Iris and other similar plants by the <b>crimped</b> <b>edges</b> of the leaves, the fragant odour it emits when crushed, {{and the presence of}} a spadix.|$|R

Instead of capitulating, Albie's took the case to federal court, noting in their filings a pocket sandwich with <b>crimped</b> <b>edges</b> and no crust was called a [...] "pasty" [...] and had been a popular dish in northern Michigan since the nineteenth century. Federal Court determined that Albie's Foods did not infringe on J.M. Smucker Co. intellectual property rights and was allowed to continue, overturning J.M. Smucker Co. cease and desist.|$|R
