40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen growing concern about {{problems}} of electoral integrity. The most overt malpractices used by rulers include imprisoning dissidents, harassing adversaries, coercing voters, vote-rigging counts, and even blatant {{disregard for the}} popular vote. Serious violations of human rights, undermining electoral credibility, are widely condemned by <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> and the international community. Recent protests about integrity have mobilized in countries as diverse as Russia, Mexico, and Egypt. Elsewhere minor irregularities are common, exemplified by inaccurate voter registers, maladministration of polling facilities, lack of security in absentee ballots, pro-government media bias, ballot miscounts, and gerrymandering. Long-standing democracies are far from immune to these ills; past problems include the notorious hanging chads in Florida in 2000 and more recent accusations of voter fraud and voter suppression during the Obama-Romney contest...|$|R

40|$|Although its precise {{definition}} is contested, {{the concept of}} the ‘Anglosphere’ has grown in political discourse in the past decade. Anglospherist authors have defined it as a group of states tied together on the basis of shared tradition, laws, liberty and language. And yet they do not discuss India substantively, placing it firmly on the outside of its hierarchy. Others have argued the concept is based in a racialised, Anglo-Saxon identity. In 2005, Manmohan Singh surprised some <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> by emphasising India's positive connections to the ‘English-speaking world’ while speaking at Oxford University. Shortly after, India announced negotiations on a civil nuclear agreement with the US, leading to similar agreements with Canada, the UK and Australia. This article uses the contemporary India–US nuclear engagement to investigate India's position in relation to the ideational space of the Anglosphere and how this shapes India–Anglosphere relations. It is argued that India's postcolonial scepticism towards this space combined with the inherent anglocentrism in Anglosphere identity discourse limits India–Anglosphere relations while simultaneously animating nuclear engagement.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the perceptions of election stakeholders {{with regard to the}} management of the 2011 electoral processes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The involvement of civil society organizations, electoral experts and academia, including party agents as <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> and stakeholders in Congolese electoral processes, is crucial as they help electoral and participatory democracy to take root in the DRC. This study was underpinned by political trust, political support and neopatrimonial theories. Furthermore, a mixed methods research design was used {{in order to understand the}} perceptions of stakeholders on the management of the 2011 electoral processes in the DRC. The findings of the study showed that stakeholders‟ perceptions on the management of the 2011 electoral processes in the DRC were driven by both internal and external factors pertaining to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that have the potential to affect the electoral processes as well as the level of trust in the INEC and other institutions involved in the electoral processes.

40|$|Bangladesh is a {{parliamentary}} democracy, with broad powers exercised by the Prime Minister. Khaleda Zia, {{leader of the}} Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), became Prime Minister (PM) following parliamentary elections in October 2001, deemed to be free and fair by international and <b>domestic</b> <b>observers.</b> The BNP formed a four-party alliance government with Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP), and Islami Oikko Jote (IOJ). Two major parties dominate the political scene, the BNP and the Awami League (AL). Political competition is vigorous, and violence is a pervasive feature of politics. The Government's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Security forces committed a number of extrajudicial killings. The police; the paramilitary organization, Bangladesh Rifles (BDR); the auxiliary organization, Ansar; and the army used unwarranted lethal force. The police often employed excessive, sometimes lethal, force in dealing with opposition demonstrators, and the police routinely employed physical and psychological torture during arrests and interrogations. Prison conditions were extremely poor and were a contributing factor in some deaths in custody. Police corruption remained a problem. Nearly all abuses went unpunished, and the climate of impunity remained a serious obstacle to ending abuse and killings. In February, Parliament adopted legislation shielding security forces from any legal consequences of their action, which included numerou...|$|R

5000|$|The {{status of}} the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a {{referendum}} on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against. This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the {{permanent members of the}} United Nations Security Council all recognised Montenegro's independence.The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)/ODIHR team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> from CDT (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM).

40|$|Papua New Guinea’s 2007 general {{election}} offered the first nationwide {{test of the}} new limited preferential voting (LPV) system, which replaced the first-past-the-post system, under which all previous post-independence elections had been conducted. In this chapter we make some observations about recent electoral reform in Papua New Guinea, particularly the impact of reforms on the Organic Law on National and Local-level Government Elections, which saw the introduction of LPV after the 2002 election. The chapter seeks to explore {{the extent to which}} electoral system reform, in particular the introduction of LPV, has influenced the conduct of elections and political culture in the Southern Highlands. The chapter draws on the reports of <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> in the Koroba-Lake Kopiago and Kagua-Erave open electorates and Southern Highlands provincial electorate (Figure  20. 1) as part of the 2007 Domestic Observation (see chapter 5). It finds that although the 2007 election was considerably less violent than other recent elections, contestation has not diminished, as evidenced by the widespread fraud and malpractice witnessed. It also finds that voting irregularities and money politics were more pervasive than in previous elections; individual voters were observed to have greater access to cash and were more mobile than in past elections, so they were better positioned to seek out transactional extra-marital sexual relations. The chapter finds that the 2007 election provided a context for heightened sexual activity, which has important implications with respect to HIV transmission...|$|R
40|$|Italian {{politics}} have often appeared paradoxical. On one hand, foreign observers have routinely highlighted {{the instability of}} the Italian political system, focusing attention on the often remarkably short life of the country’s governments. On the other hand, <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> have typically stressed the immutability of the system, focusing attention {{on the fact that}} a single party [...] the Christian Democrats [...] controlled the state for over 50 years without interruption. Both facts are of course true; if governments came and went – which they did with awesome rapidity – the politicians leading them did not change, at least over the period from 1944 to 1993. The simultaneity of fluidity and robustness suggests that there is some truth to the old adage that trees that bend in the wind will last longer than those that are rigid. Just considering the past decade we find the same debate. Local observers are strongly split as to whether, following electoral reforms in 1993, the structure of the Italian political system has changed. One side says yes – that the rules of engagement are different, the other says no, that the characteristic feature of politics in Italy –- that the more things appear to change the more they stay the same – is never more clearly revealed than in the last decade, after electoral reform. Are both sides of this debate right? What happened in Italy after 1993, when the structur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There are six African {{small island}} {{developing}} states: the Union of the Comoros; the Republic of Guinea‐Bissau; the Republic of Cabo Verde; the Republic of Mauritius; the Seychelles and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. Apart from Mauritius, {{the other five}} states are relatively new to democracy with several of these states only transitioning from one party states to multi‐party states in the early 1990 s. International and <b>domestic</b> <b>observers</b> declared the last round of elections in all ASIDS free and fair, but this reveals little {{of the quality of}} elections in these small island developing states. All six states are members of the African Union (AU) and are therefore obliged to adhere to its election principles. Therefore, this article examines the quality of elections in the ASIDS by analysing {{the extent to which they}} are free and fair using the principles of the AU’s Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa. Findings reveal that despite continued logistical and other problems that persist, the election process is generally well managed and violence relatively minimal, a remarkable achievement given the volatile political histories in all save one of these small island states. Challenges appear to centre on continued inter‐institutional instability in some cases, failure to adhere to constitutional amendments in others, some instances of continued harassment and a lack of financial and technical resources, all of which have to some extent impacted electoral qualit...|$|R
