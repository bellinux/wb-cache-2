5000|$|A <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (FPO) is a {{post office}} set up during time of war or when a {{military}} unit is on manoeuvres. It is set up [...] "in the field", hence the name, however, FPOs may be on land or at sea. Their use pre-dates the introduction of postage stamps.|$|E

50|$|After {{complaints}} about the mail services to the British troops fighting in the Crimean War (1854-56) the Postmaster General authorised the secondment of GPO staff to organise and distribute mail in the theatre of war. A Base Army Post Office was established in Constantinople and a <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>Office</b> with the Army Headquarters at Balaklava.|$|E
50|$|The Army Postal service {{closed on}} 30 May 1885 {{after which the}} Indian <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> in Suakin served the {{remaining}} troops. The services of Army Post Office Corps was not called upon again until the Anglo-Boer War. Three years after the Army Post Office Corps' men returned to Great Britain, an Army Post Office Corps Field Manual (1888) was issued.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{services}} had insignia {{of their}} own: {{for example the}} Feldpost (en: <b>Field</b> <b>post</b> <b>office)</b> wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials FP; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. Beamten in the employ of a military administration authority {{in the occupied territories}} wore MV pins (de: abbreviation to Militärverwaltung) rather than HV ciphers.|$|E

50|$|Stationary Army <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> were {{established}} at Alexandria, Ramleh, Cairo, Port Said and Ismaila, while mobile <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> {{were attached to}} the divisional headquarters and moved when they moved. On 9 September, {{during the battle of}} Kassassin, the Army <b>Post</b> <b>Office,</b> under the charge of Sergeant FJ Inwood, attached to HQ 2 Division came under fire, but no one was injured, nevertheless the incident resulted in the Inwood and his men becoming the first volunteers to see shots fired in anger.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} plan {{was that the}} Army <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> Corps staff be deployed at the Base Army <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> in Cape Town and establish <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> along the Lines of communication (LofC), however, this did not materialise because General Buller, the Commander in Chief, decided to adopt a two pronged attack; one from Cape Province, the other from Natal. Therefore, {{the resources of the}} service had to be split to support the two prongs and a second Base Army <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> responsible for servicing the troops in Natal was established at Pietermaritzburg.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} 1867-8 {{invasion}} {{that culminated}} in the Battle of Magdala, the British established a <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> at Massawa (then a port of Ethiopia) in November 1867, using stamps of British India. The territory of Harar was taken by Egypt in 1875, and {{in the following year}} a post office was established; letters from there used Egyptian stamps canceled with a maltese cross.|$|E
50|$|These {{have been}} {{confirmed}} as having been issued at BFPO 567, Nicosia, Cyprus, which has since closed down. A 50 Pence postal order bearing the datestamp 'UN NICOSIA BFPO 567' with the date '04. AP 05' is in a private collection in New Zealand. This unusual date stamp reflects that this particular BFPO was designated as an official United Nations <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>office.</b> The BFPO issues are very sought after by collectors, as {{the location of the}} BFPOs is usually a closely guarded secret in the British Armed Forces for security reasons.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1944, none {{of these}} {{officials}} were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (Truppensonderdienst or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (Intendanten) in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (Zahlmeister) {{in the ranks of}} first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (Richter) in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.|$|E
5000|$|Opal was {{discovered}} there in 1930, [...] {{and the town}} developed out of the scattered miners' camps which established in the area. An Andamooka Opal <b>Fields</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> was not opened until 13 January 1947, and was renamed Andamooka in 1990. The road into Andamooka was sealed in the 1990s, but the remaining roads in the town are still unsealed.|$|R
50|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Nazi Germany in 1940, a British/French expeditionary force in {{northern}} Norway established <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> that operated until withdrawal in June 1940. While the new collaborationist government in Norway issued its own stamps, the government-in-exile, based in London, issued stamps {{for the use}} of the Royal Norwegian Navy and the merchant marine. These stamps were also used in Jan Mayen island, and, from February 1945, in a Norwegian <b>post</b> <b>office</b> established in Stockholm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{civilian}} population {{were able to}} send mail through the Indian Army postal service <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> using Indian Expeditionary Forces stamps (Indian stamps overprinted [...] "I.E.F."). [...] When civilian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> were opened in 1917, stamps of East Africa and Uganda were issued overprinted with [...] "G.E.A.". The same overprint appeared on stamps inscribed [...] "East Africa and Uganda Protectorates," [...] but these were issued after the establishment of Tanganyika, and are considered part of Tanganyika's postal history.|$|R
5000|$|Tracing {{undeliverable}} mailIt {{is a sad}} {{fact that}} during war battlefield casualties invariably produce large quantities of undeliverable mail. In the field, such mail that comes to hand in the units was checked against unit records and disposed of appropriately. [...] Unit mail {{which could not be}} delivered for whatever reason was returned to the Army Post Office (APO) or <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> (FPO), and sent back to postal detachments located at the formation's 2nd Echelon. These detachments checked the mail against the Field Records. Mail that could not be dealt with was returned to the Return Letter Branch (RLB) at HPC RE for further searching and consultation with the Records Office of the appropriate arm. If that proved unsuccessful the letter was eventually returned to the sender.|$|E
5000|$|On March 11, USS Prinz Eugen sailed for San Pedro Naval Base on the Pacific {{coast of}} the United States, via the Panama Canal. The ship was {{assigned}} her own <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> designation as U.S.S. [...] "PRINZ EUGEN" [...] (IX/300), c/o Fleet Post Office, San Francisco-Calif. Against Graubart's recommendation, the final group of German seamen (153 men) including Captain Reinicke left the ship on May 1 and an American crew of 526 seamen took over. A few days later she departed for Honolulu, arriving there on May 10. The American crew, not used to German machinery, was not successful in operating the ship's boilers, thus effectively ending Graubart's command. The Prinz Eugen had to be towed to the Bikini Atoll {{to be used as}} a target ship in Operation Crossroads, the Bikini Atoll atomic tests conducted against ships in 1946.The two last Captains of Prinz Eugen remained friends until Reinicke's death in 1978; Graubart spoke at the funeral.|$|E
5000|$|Peter the Great enacted reforms {{making the}} postal system more uniform in its operations, and in 1714 the first general post offices opened in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. “Regular post service” was {{established}} along the Moscow and Riga routes. In February 1714, {{the postal service}} started biweekly runs from St. Petersburg to Riga; in June it started runs from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The <b>field</b> <b>post</b> <b>office</b> was founded in 1716, and the so-called ordinary post service in 1720, for fast conveyance of state ordinances and papers. Regular delivery of private parcels (the so-called heavy post) was organized in the 1730-40s. In 1746, parcels and private correspondence were first delivered by courier, and starting in 1781 money, too, could be delivered to one's door. The earliest known Russian postmark dates from July 1765; it is a single line reading [...] "ST.PETERSBOVRG" [...] (in Latin letters), but the first official recommendation to use postmarks did not come until 1781.|$|E
50|$|By August 1900 the war {{moved from}} a fluid one to garrisoning the {{territory}} that had been gained. Consequently, the <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> were converted into Stationary Army <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and were issued with {{a new series of}} date stamps, which included the name of the town where the office was based.To service these Stationary <b>Offices,</b> five Travelling <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> (TPO - <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operating from a railway carriage) were set up and were operated by the APOC. The TPO vans were improvised from large box trucks fitted out with sorting frames, tables etc. by the Royal Engineers.|$|R

50|$|The first {{offices were}} in Beijing, Kalgan, Tientsin, and Urga (in Mongolia), all in areas near to Russian-controlled territory. In November 1886 {{additional}} offices opened in Shanghai, Chefoo, Hankow {{with offices in}} Port Arthur, and Dairen following soon afterwards. In addition, many Russian <b>Field</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operated throughout Manchuria and civilian mail was frequently accepted there as well. Finally, the Chinese Eastern Railway had Russian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> operating at {{most of the major}} stations, and important cities along the railway such as Harbin had several Russian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> in the town itself. In addition, Travelling <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> operated in trains along the Chinese Eastern Railway.|$|R
