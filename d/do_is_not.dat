25|$|The Indian violin, while {{essentially}} the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa–pa (do–sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as C–G–C–G or A–E–A–E. The tonic sa (<b>do)</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right foot {{out in front of}} them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well {{due to the nature of}} Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left hand, so it is important for the violin to be in a steady, unmoving position.|$|E

He {{noted that}} by rearranging equipment—and often keeping the same setup for around just five minutes—it {{allowed him to}} explore more writing possibilities; he said [...] "that will achieve some sort of purpose, so the way I've wired it together becomes the track in itself." [...] James also explained that when composing the [...] "logical thing to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> change anything and just do another one using {{the same set of}} sounds", but during Syros recording sessions he would often [...] "get bored and swap things out".|$|E
500|$|Kavner {{was then}} {{cast as a}} sidekick to Tracey Ullman in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

What her character <b>does,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> cheap." [...] As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language.|$|R

500|$|Lord Carteret read {{passages}} from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for {{the identity of the}} Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an [...] "unfortunate accident" [...] and {{he did not want to}} respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, [...] "to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were [...] "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.|$|E
500|$|Some {{argue that}} what {{scientists}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> inductive reasoning {{at all but}} rather abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, {{it is not always}} clear what is meant by the [...] "best explanation." [...] Ockham's razor, which counsels choosing the simplest available explanation, thus {{plays an important role in}} some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this heuristic principle more precise in terms of theoretical parsimony or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing I want you to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E

2500|$|Obama opposes {{offering}} reparations to {{the descendants}} of slaves. [...] "I have {{said in the past}} – and I'll repeat again – that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed," [...] Obama said. An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said. [...] "I consistently believe {{that when it comes to}} whether it's Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, the most important thing for the U.S. government to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> just offer words, but offer deeds," [...] Obama told a meeting in Chicago in July 2008.|$|E
2500|$|... "11 July 2003: On {{occasion}} {{something happens}} {{in life that}} {{makes you want to}} believe in miracles. Like today!

2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn makes them feel incompetent. They may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E

2500|$|In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{limit on}} its actual agency, but an {{epistemological}} boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, [...] "I am a liar", then {{how can it be}} true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. [...] Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, [...] "God can" [...] before it. Lewis additionally said that, [...] "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." [...] This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.|$|E
