25|$|According to the {{findings}} of the official MAK investigation, the crash can be blamed on both the airport services, which did not inform the pilot about the reduced visibility in time due to organizational problems, and on the pilot, who did not give the dispatcher the correct information about his landing trajectory and, consequently, did not decide to stop the landing procedure and try to take another approach at the time <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, Fanti {{relocated}} to Switzerland where purely by chance he {{was presented with}} the opportunity to put into practice what he thought <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with the ill-fated diplomat. A German businessman wanted to start a psychotherapy treatment but he only had five weeks at his disposal. Fanti proposed him to maximize this short time available to them by doing sessions lasting a few hours on a daily basis. According to Fanti the difference was notable as themes and experiences that with 45 minutes sessions are held long before they appear tend to emerge sooner and in a much more spontaneous way. Fanti got convinced that daily long-lasting sessions empowered the work of association and liberated the psyche in a more physiological way from the natural resistances opposed to the psychoanalytical work as well as those specifically neurotic ones. The experience turned out to be so positive for Fanti that he decided to adopt the daily long-lasting sessions.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Some {{consider}} Irataba a {{great leader}} who championed peace, but others feel <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more to defend the Mohave way of life. The Irataba Society, a non-profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian Tribes, was established in 1970 in Parker, Arizona, where a sports venue, Irataba Hall, is also named after him. In 2002, the US Bureau of Land Management designated [...] in the Eldorado Mountains as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness. In March 2015, Mohave Tribal chairman Dennis Patch credited Irataba with ensuring that [...] "the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial." ...|$|E
500|$|As a Nazi Party {{member and}} war profiteer, Schindler must flee the {{advancing}} Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory {{have been ordered}} to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, {{so that they can}} [...] "return to [...] families as men, instead of murderers." [...] He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic quotation: [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." [...] Schindler is touched, but also deeply ashamed, as he feels <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> even more. As the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) wake up the next morning, a Soviet soldier arrives to announce that they have been liberated. The Jews leave the factory and walk to a nearby town.|$|E

[...] He also noted that, [...] "'When I Was Your Man' goes minimal with the musical accompaniment, {{featuring}} just Bruno and his piano, sounding halfway between an Alicia Keys ballad and Prince’s 'How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?'." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent called it a [...] "McCartney-esque piano ballad." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the song [...] "sounds {{like a cross between}} Stevie Wonder and Elton John," [...] also seeing [...] "a touch of Michael Jackson" [...] in his delivery. Sam Lansky of Idolator agreed, writing that [...] "while evoking Elton John, the track sounds like it was recorded live in a piano bar, with audible background noise, like the spooling of film on a projector."

500|$|Returning to England for the 1906 season, Crawford {{completed}} the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in first-class cricket, the youngest player {{at the time}} to accomplish this feat. Against Gloucestershire, he scored 148 and then took seven for 85 and four for 63 with the ball; he also took ten wickets in his next game. In total, he compiled 1,174 runs at an average of 30.10, and took 118 wickets at an average of 20.28. These performances earned him selection for the representative Gentlemen versus Players matches at both Lord's and The Oval, in which he played for the amateur Gentlemen. At the end of the season, he was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation said: [...] "Few cricketers have won equal fame at so early an age", and noted the unusual ease with which he had moved into first-class cricket. Crawford's powerful batting and straight hitting were praised, as was his accurate bowling. The report also stated: [...] "That <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> all this is the more astonishing from the fact that he invariably plays in glasses. No one handicapped in this way has ever been so consistently successful both as batsman and bowler." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the disputed}} June 2009 Iranian presidential election, Obama {{condemned}} the Iranian government's crackdown on the Iranian Green Movement opposition, {{a group of}} pro-democracy demonstrators. Obama stated: [...] "we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, but [...] "I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values {{and need to be}} respected." [...] After more violent was directed at protesters, Obama stated: [...] "The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days" [...] and issued a strong condemnation of [...] "these unjust actions." [...] Some critics, including his 2012 presidential campaign rival Mitt Romney, faulted Obama, saying that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more to support the Green Movement. Others disagreed, noting that the Green Movement did not need or want direct foreign support, and arguing that direct U.S. backing for the Iranian opposition would likely [...] "undermine its credibility, and perhaps even lend credence to the government’s assertion that the movement is a foreign-inspired plot that will rob Iran of its independence." ...|$|E

2500|$|De Gaulle {{returned}} to France, {{where he became}} a lecturer in military history at St Cyr. He was already a powerful speaker, after practice as a prisoner of war. He then studied at the École de Guerre (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here he clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise {{in which he had}} played the role of commander, he refused to answer a question about supplies, replying [...] "de minimis non curat praetor" [...] ("a leader does not concern himself with trivia") before ordering the responsible officer to answer Moyrand. He obtained respectable but not outstanding grades – 15 or so out of 20 – on many of his assessments. Moyrand wrote in his final report that he was “an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent” but criticised him for not deriving as much benefit from the course as <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> and for his arrogance: his “excessive self-confidence”, his harsh dismissal of the views of others “and his attitude of a King in exile”. Having entered 33rd out of 129 he graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of assez bien (“good enough”). He was posted to Mainz to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the French Army of Occupation.|$|E
2500|$|McLean {{was born}} in Sydney, Australia, the son of John Donald McLean, colonial {{treasurer}} of Queensland, Australia. He went to England where was educated at Eton College and made his first appearance at Henley in the Eton eight winning the Ladies' Challenge Plate in 1882. He went on to New College, Oxford where he rowed in the Oxford crew in the Boat Race five times between 1883 and 1887, winning the 1883 and 1885 races. He won the University Pairs for New College in 1885 and also Silver Goblets at Henley with his brother, Hector McLean. In 1886 the McLean brothers were beaten in {{the final of the}} Silver Goblets by Stanley Muttlebury and Fraser Churchill. McLean was Australia in December 1886 when he played a match for Geelong Cricket Club and then in India at the start of 1887, but returned in time to take part in his fifth boat race. During the race McLean's oar broke. Oxford were behind at Barnes Railway Bridge, but Cambridge moved into rougher water too far over to the Surrey bank and Oxford were expecting to push through when the disaster struck. Guy Nickalls, then in his first Boat Race, recorded [...] "Then, 'Ducker' McLean broke his oar off short at the button. With the station in our favour and him out of the boat we could have won even then, but 'Ducker' funked the oncoming penny steamers and, instead of jumping overboard as <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> we had to lug his now useless body along, to lose the finish." [...] At Henley the McLeans were again runners up in Silver Goblets to Muttlebury and Charles Theodore Barclay.|$|E
