40|$|The static {{volumetric}} method, {{described in}} ISO 6144 : 2001, {{is a common}} tool to generate primary reference gas mixtures. As it is a manual and bulky system it was aimed at developing an automatic and more compact device resulting in a prototype of an automatic static volumetric method. Based on the injection of a pure compound {{by means of a}} loop instead of a syringe and housed in a portable 19 ” rack it fits for both laboratory use and field measurements. The generation of the gas mixture is controlled by computer running software elaborated during the construction and testing period. The most crucial point, the evaluation of the loop volumes, was solved developing two techniques allowing traceability to SI units. So far gas mixtures of nitrogen monoxide in nitrogen in the range 10 - 9 mol/mol and carbon monoxide in air in the range 10 - 6 mol/mol have been generated and the uncertainties of the gas mixtures were calculated. Comparisons to other calibration techniques like <b>dynamic</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> (NO), permeation (NO 2) and direct sampling of primary reference material (CO) confirmed the differences of the methods within their uncertainties.

However, porosity determined by image analysis provided average porosity {{in addition to}} pore-wall thickness and roundness of pores. The values of porosity were comparable with values measured by <b>volumetric</b> <b>method.</b> Additionally it provided better correlation with M 40 index as compared to porosity by <b>volumetric</b> <b>method.</b> The pore wall thickness measurement by image analysis provided significant correlations with M 40, CRI and CSR values. This explains the usability of image analysis for coke structure measurement. A comparative study was carried out for measurement by <b>volumetric</b> <b>method,</b> image analysis, mercury porosimetry and X-ray CT scan measurements. It showed limitation of representatives of coke sample against the measurement of mercury porosimetry and CT scan measurement as these methods use single piece not the crushed sample. Pore wall thickness affects M 40 index, CRI and CSR and this can be determined only by image analysis. High VM with insufficient dilatation coals were used in carbonization shown high porosity values with lower pore roundness (high low-circularity of pores: connected pores).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Detection of {{longitudinal}} changes {{in white matter}} hyperintensities (WMH) by using visual rating scales is problematic. We compared a widely used visual rating scale with a <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> to study longitudinal white matter changes. METHODS: WMH were assessed with the visual Scheltens scale and a <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> in 100 elderly subjects aged 70 – 81 years for whom repetitive MR images were available with an interval of 33 (SD, 1. 4) months. Reliability was determined by intraclass correlation coefficients. To examine the sensitivity of both the visual and <b>volumetric</b> <b>method,</b> we calculated Spearman rank correlations of WMH ratings and volume measurements with age. RESULTS: Reliability of the visual rating scale was good, whereas reliability of the volumetric mea-surement was excellent. For baseline measurements of WMH, we found weaker associations be-tweenWMH and age when assessed with the visual scale (r 0. 20, P. 045) than with the <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> (r 0. 31, P. 002). Longitudinal evaluation of WMH assessments showed regression in 26 % of the subjects when analyzed with the visual rating scale against 12 % of the subjects when using volumetric measurements.

With the tight coupling of Lagrangian mechanics, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>volumetric</b> simplex splines representing the object can accurately simulate its physical behavior because it can unify the geometric and material properties in the simulation.

Twenty-eight participants with a transtibial amputation > 1 year participated in the study. Two observers measured stump volume twice, two weeks apart, using both Sitzia's method and the water displacement <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> (criterion standard test). The mean differences and upper and lower limits of agreement between the water displacement <b>volumetric</b> <b>method</b> and Sitzia's method, between the first and second assessment, and between both assessors were calculated. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were derived from random-effects two-way analysis of variance. Inter-observer agreements of both methods were high and ranged from 86 - 96 %. Intra-observer agreement ranged between 57 % and 71 %. In both methods the inter- and intra-observer differences were not significant.
