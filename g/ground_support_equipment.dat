5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

25|$|The {{hazardous}} {{gas detection}} system monitors {{the presence of}} hazardous gases in the IU and S-IVB stage forward compartments during vehicle fueling.

During fueling, gaseous nitrogen was supplied instead of air, to purge any propellant gases that might otherwise accumulate in the IU.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{radar and}} {{missiles}} {{proved to be}} effective and pilots reported that the Lightning was easy to fly. However, {{in the first few}} months of operation the aircraft's serviceability was extremely poor. This was due to the complexity of the aircraft systems and shortages of spares and <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment.</b> Even when the Lightning was not grounded by technical faults, the RAF initially struggled to get more than 20 flying hours per aircraft per month compared with the 40 flying hours that English Electric believed could be achieved with proper support.

A forward air control operation named Raven FACs {{was formed in}} Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at Waterpump before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the elaboration of}} the problem of optimal algorithm synthesis of complex signal processing of satel- lite GLONASS/GPS systems navigation relayed from the Board of the upper-air radiosonde and the output data upper-air radar to determine the spatial coordinates of upper-air radiosonde. The upper-air sounding is performed with the help of technical means of radio sounding system of atmosphere, including the upper-air radiosonde, manufactured in free flight, and <b>ground</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>equipment,</b> which includes devices for signal processing of upper-air radiosonde and preparation of the operational upper-air mes- sages. The peculiarity of atmosphere radio sounding of domestic system is the measurement with method of radar slant range to upper-air radiosonde, the viewing angles of the antenna upper-air radar to determine azimuth and elevation of upper-air radiosonde. The disadvantage of the radar method of radiosonde support is the relatively low accuracy of determining the coordinates of the radiosonde and the possible disruption of automatic tracking in angular coordinates. Satellite navigation system based on the mi- crowave sensors has clear advantages in terms of efficiency, size, mobility, and use on mobile objects, however, with significant drawbacks associated primarily with the geometric factor and the error propagation of the navigation signal. The article presents a mathematical model useful incoherent GLONASS/GPS signals, relayed by the upper-air radiosonde, and interference on the input receiver ground point for complex information processing, and mathematical models of output data in upper-air radars...|$|R

The MCS officers tasked with carrying out an inventory of the new service's assets concluded that achieving the transfer of 323 vessels was possible.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the atmospheric emission inventory of the Lombardy Region, a region with 9 million inhabitants in Nor-them Italy, a detailed assessment of emissions from aircrafts and airport land activities in the three main airports of the region has been made for the year 2001, 2003 and 2005. The inventory is based on a daily evaluation of LTO (Landing and Take-Oft) cycle for each aircraft category, derived from data recorded in every airport, and on emission factors proposed by the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook for the main aircraft types. The paper shows hourly, daily and monthly emission patterns computed for every airport, as well as average emission factors. Results point out that airports in Lombardy represent an interesting source of NOx emissions (about 1 % of total NO(x) emissions in Lombardy in 2005), whereas for PM and other pollutants the contribution is lower. A critical point of the emission assessment is the availability of reliable emission factors: for 35 % of flights the emission factors were not available for the exact aircraft model and were hence based on similar types in size and engine characteristics. <b>Ground</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipments</b> are also considered basing on fleet data and fuel consumption in every airport, as well as average emission factors proposed by the reference methodology for airport land activities. LTO emissions are far higher than emissions from diesel vehicles used in land activities.
