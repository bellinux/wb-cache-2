40|$|Salt-marsh {{soils are}} soils {{characterized}} by non-permanent hydric saturation that, depending on factors like duration of submersion periods, {{are dominated by}} different salt-tolerant plant species. The composition of microbial communities is an essential component in trophic dynamics and biogeochemical processes in salt marshes, and determines the level of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities,</b> which catalyze the conversion of complex molecules into simpler ones. Despite of this, the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> in marsh-soils {{has not yet been}} investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> in two soil profiles of marsh-soils under different water saturation level and dominated by different plant species [Juncus maritimus Lam and Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald (Sp) ]. In both soils, the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> were much lower than the levels typically found in terrestrial ecosystems. The <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> were measured both in air-dried and in re-moistened and incubated soil samples. In air-dried samples, the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> were higher in Juncus than in Spartina soil and tended to decrease with depth, being sharper the decrease in Juncus than in Spartina soil. Re-moistened and pre-incubated soils showed a general increase in all the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> and throughout the whole soil profile, especially in Spartina soils. Hydrolase activities showed a strong and positive relationship with organic matter content both in air-dried and in re-moistened soil samples, higher in these latter. In general, oxidoreductase activities only showed this relationship in re-moistened soil samples. More studies, preferably using freshly collected soil samples, are needed to understand the relationship between <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> and these environmental conditions...|$|R

5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity,</b> while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E

The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method.

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.|$|E

After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S.

5|$|Poly(A)polymerase {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1960 as an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> in extracts made from cell nuclei that could polymerise ATP, but not ADP, into polyadenine. Although identified in {{many types of}} cells, this activity had no known function until 1971, when poly(A) sequences were found in mRNAs. The only function of these sequences was thought at first to be protection of the 3' end of the RNA from nucleases, but later the specific roles of polyadenylation in nuclear export and translation were identified. The polymerases responsible for polyadenylation were first purified and characterized in the 1960s and 1970s, but {{the large number of}} accessory proteins that control this process were discovered only in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can bind {{to other}} {{proteins}} {{as well as to}} small-molecule substrates. When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein–protein interactions also regulate <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity,</b> control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also bind to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{identity of}} enzymes was still {{unknown in the}} early 1900s. Many scientists observed that <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity</b> was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley, {{who worked on the}} digestive enzymes pepsin (1930), trypsin and chymotrypsin. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
40|$|Thraustochytrids are marine osmo-heterotrophic protists {{which have}} been {{isolated}} from different habitats and substrates. These organisms are typically encountered in association with refractory substrates, but {{the extent of their}} role in organic matter decomposition is still unknown.

5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activity.</b> Additionally, proteins can be isolated according their charge using electrofocusing.|$|E

Three different strategies for soil carbon sequestration were studied: minimum tillage, protection of biodegradable organic fraction by compost amendment and oxidative polimerization of soil organic matter catalyzed by biometic porfirins. All strategies were compared with a traditional agricultural management based on tillage and mineral fertilization. Experiments were carried out in three Italian soils from different pedo-climatic regions located respectively in Piacenza, Turin and Naples and cultivated with maize or wheat. Soil samples were taken for three consecutive years after harvest and analyzed for their content in phosphates, ß-glucosidase, urease and invertase. An alteration index based on these <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> levels was applied as well. The biomimetic porfirin application didn’t cause changes in <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> compared to the control at any treatment or location. <b>Enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> were generally higher in the minimum tillage and compost treatment, while differences between location and date of samplings were limited. Application of the soil alteration index based on <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> showed that soils treated with compost or subjected to minimum tillage generally have a higher biological quality.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{dynamics}} of biochemical (<b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities)</b> and chemical (water-soluble fraction) parameters during 100 days of municipal solid wastes composting were studied to evaluate their suitability as tools for compost characterization. The hydrolase (protease, urease, cellulase, β-glucosidase) and dehydrogenase activities were characterized by significant changes during the first 2 weeks of composting, because of the increase of easily decomposable organic compounds. After the 4 th week a “maturation phase” was identified in which the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> tended to gently decrease, suggesting the stabilisation of organic matter. Also the water-soluble fractions (water-soluble carbon, nitrogen, carbohydrates and phenols), which are involved in many degradation processes, showed major fluctuations during {{the first month of}} composting. The results obtained showed that the hydrolytic activities and the water-soluble fractions did not vary statistically during the last month of composting. Significant correlations between the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities,</b> as well as between enzyme activities and water-soluble fractions, were also highlighted. These results highlight the suitability of both <b>enzymatic</b> <b>activities</b> and water soluble fractions as suitable indicators of the state and evolution of the organic matter during composting. However, since in the literature the amount of each activity or fraction at the end of composting depends on the raw material used for composting, single point determinations appear inadequate for compost characterization.
