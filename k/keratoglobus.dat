40|$|Introduction: <b>Keratoglobus</b> is a {{controversial}} issue and still remains {{as one of}} the ambiguous corneal disorders; it can be managed by different surgical techniques successfully; yet the risk of globe rupture is high in these patients due to corneal weakness. In cases of progressive involvement, a large corneal graft is needed due to extreme thinness of the cornea. Recent adventures in surgical techniques have led to the introduction of new managements particularly in <b>Keratoglobus</b> treatment such as the "tuck procedure" in which a 12  mm corneo-scleral graft is miniaturized at its peripheral margin. A pocket is formed at the limbus of the recipient and the donor graft is "tucked" into it. We present a case of epikeratoplasty in <b>Keratoglobus</b> management. Case:  A 45 -year-old man with no history of a systemic disease underwent epikeratoplasty with the diagnosis of advanced bilateral <b>keratoglobus</b> since three years and six months before in the left and right eye, respectively. Pachymetry and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded before and six months after surgery. The highest recorded BCVA was 5 / 200 before the operation, whereas it was measured 6 / 10 (left eye) and 4 / 10 (right eye) at six-month follow-up examinations. Pachymetric findings improved from 244 to 773 and 212 to 744 (thinnest points) in the left and right eyes, respectively. Conclusion: Epikeratoplasty is a relatively safe, effective and reversible extraoccular procedure in the management of <b>keratoglobus.</b> It can also be performed to flatten the cornea and protect it against acute corneal hydrops and perforation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the technique of}} limbal stem cell-sparing corneoscleroplasty {{for the management of}} advanced <b>keratoglobus.</b> Methods: A patient with bilateral advanced <b>keratoglobus,</b> with best-corrected visual acuity of 20 / 400 in the right eye and 20 / 200 in the left eye, underwent limbal stem cell-sparing corneoscleroplasty of the right eye. Initially, a 360 -degree limbal incision with 200 -μm depth was created, followed by a sublimbal tunnel dissection into the sclera, in order to conserve stem cells. Next, a limbus-to-limbus lamellar keratectomy at 200 -μm depth was performed. Meanwhile, a donor corneoscleral button with preserved endothelium of the central 8 mm was fashioned. Prior to suturing the donor corneoscleral graft using a modified suturing technique to cover its scleral component, a full-thickness trephination of 8 -mm diameter was completed in the central host cornea. Results: Reepithelialization occurred within the first week. No episodes of rejection, intraocular pressure spikes, or epithelial breakdown were observed postoperatively. At the 6 -month follow-up, the patient had 20 / 70 best-corrected vision and a smooth cornea with regular astigmatism on topography. Conclusion: Limbal stem cell-sparing corneoscleroplasty is a single-step technique for restoring the structural integrity of the cornea in advanced <b>keratoglobus</b> while preserving the host limbal stem cells...|$|E

40|$|Context: This {{study was}} carried out {{as a part of}} an {{internal}} audit and is the largest series of patients having <b>keratoglobus,</b> published in the literature. Poor visual acuity of the patients indicates the blinding nature of the disease. Aims: We report our experience with patients having <b>keratoglobus</b> at a tertiary eye care center in India. Settings and Design : Retrospective study. Materials and Methods: We analyzed adults and pediatric patients (20 / 40 in 6 / 42 (14. 3 %) pediatric eyes and 15 / 53 (28. 30 %) adults. Visual acuity ranging from counting of fingers to no light perception was noted in 20 / 53 (37. 74 %) adults and 21 / 42 (50 %) pediatric patients; 13 / 20 (65 %) with blue sclera and 8 / 22 eyes (36. 37 %) without blue sclera. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis was present in one pediatric patient. Choroidal osteoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and retinal detachment were present in adults. Surgeries performed were corneal tear repair (5 eyes), tissue adhesive application (2 eyes), descematopexy (4 eyes) and penetrating keratoplasty (PK - 8 eyes: Three had post-PK glaucoma, graft failure-one eye, 4 patients wore scleral lens - prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem). Conclusions: About 50 % of pediatric eyes (65 % having blue sclera) had no functional vision. Trivial trauma was responsible for corneal rupture indicating need for protective glasses.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of HLA-DRB 1 (Human Leukocyte Antigens) matching in corneal transplantation. Fifty-two patients were observed. Low-risk group consisted of 28 patients and high-risk group consisted of 24 patients. All the patients and donors were tissue typed with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on the HLADRB 1 gen. The primary corneal disease preceding keratoplasty was keratopathia (15), leucoma (10), keratoconus (7), Re-KPP (6), impending perforation (4), combustio corneae (3), degenerative disorders (2), <b>keratoglobus</b> (1), keratouveitis (1), corneal maculae (1), and corneal melting syndrome (1). The graft rejection frequency was higher in the group of high-risk patients (29 %) than in the group of low risk patients (7. 1 %).

40|$|Background. Penetrating {{keratoplasty}} (PK) {{is rarely}} performed in mentally retarded patients, {{first of all}} because of numerous complications after surgery such as inflammation, self-inflicted injury, injury and because of difficult post-operative treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the success of PK in this patients. In 16 years (from May 1984 to May 2000) 201 PK were performed, but only three in mentally retarded patients. Methods. We present three cases of PK in mentally retarded patients. All the patients were men. They were 14, 16 and 27 year old. The indication for PK were in two cases acute keratoconus and in one case acute <b>keratoglobus.</b> The mean followup was 24. 6 months. Trepanation was made with rotor threpin and donor material was sutured using single continuous 10 - 0 nylon suture. Results. In two cases keratoplasties stayed clear. Visual acuities were 0, 4 and 0, 5.  In one patient with very aggressive behaviour graft failure developed with significant corneal vascularisation. Re-keratoplasty was not performed. Conclusions. Adequate post-operative care following PK in mentally retarded patients is the most important factor for the success of transplantation. The indication for the surgery must be made very carefully especially in self-aggressive patients in residential care. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Brittle cornea {{syndrome}} (BCS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} connective tissue disease characterized by variable combinations of corneal thinning and fragility, corneal ruptures either spontaneously or after minor trauma, blue sclerae, keratoconus, <b>keratoglobus,</b> and high myopia. So far, mutations in 2 genes, PRDM 5 and ZNF 469, {{have been associated with}} BCS. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe novel mutations in the PRDM 5 gene in patients with BCS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using homozygosity mapping with single-nucleotide polymorphism markers followed by whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous splice site variant (c. 93 + 5 G>A) in the PRDM 5 gene in a consanguineous Pakistani family with 4 affected individuals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis from lymphocyte-derived RNA failed to reveal any exon skipping because of this splice site variant. A homozygous variant (c. 11 T>G; p. Gln 4 Pro) in SEC 24 D also segregated with the disease in this particular family. One previously known mutation (c. 974 del; p. Cys 325 LeufsX 2) was identified in a sporadic patient with BCS from Serbia. CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed a novel mutation in the PRDM 5 gene in a BCS family and recurrent mutation in a sporadic BCS patient.

40|$|Brittle cornea {{syndrome}} (BCS; MIM 229200) is an {{autosomal recessive}} generalized connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in ZNF 469 and PRDM 5. It {{is characterized by}} extreme thinning and fragility of the cornea that may rupture {{in the absence of}} significant trauma leading to blindness. Keratoconus or <b>keratoglobus,</b> high myopia, blue sclerae, hyperelasticity of the skin without excessive fragility, and hypermobility of the small joints are additional features of BCS. Transcriptional regulation of extracellular matrix components, particularly of fibrillar collagens, by PRDM 5 and ZNF 469 suggests that they might be part of the same pathway, the disruption of which is likely to cause the features of BCS. In the present study, we have performed molecular analysis of a cohort of 23 BCS affected patients on both ZNF 469 and PRDM 5, including those who were clinically reported previously [1]; the clinical description of three additional patients is reported in detail. We identified either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ZNF 469 in 18 patients while, 4 were found to be homozygous for PRDM 5 mutations. In one single patient a mutation in neither ZNF 469 nor PRDM 5 was identified.

40|$|The brittle cornea {{syndrome}} (BCS) is {{a generalized}} connective tissue disorder characterized by corneal rupture following only minor trauma, keratoconus or <b>keratoglobus,</b> blue sclerae, hyperelasticity {{of the skin}} without excessive fragility, and hypermobility of the joints. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait but the underlying genetic defect remains undetermined. We present 23 patients (11 male) from 13 nuclear families followed at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aged 3 - 28 years at last follow-up. A total of 28 events of corneal rupture were noted in 17 patients (eight male), among whom nine had had bilateral ruptures, and eight had had unilateral ruptures (four of the right cornea), while two had experienced re-rupture 2 and 4 years, respectively, after surgery; six patients (aged 3 - 21 years) had had no ruptures. We describe {{the natural history of}} our cases and discuss them together with those others reported in the literature. Because of similarities between the BCS and the kyphoscoliotic type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VI), both disorders tend to have been confounded. Here, we show that all of our BCS patients tested in this regard had biochemical findings reflective of normal activity of lysyl hydroxylase, characteristically deficient in EDS VI, such as normal urinary total pyridinoline ratios and/or normal electrophoretic migration of collagen chains produced by dermal fibroblasts. The BCS is, therefore, an entity distinct from the kyphoscoliotic type of EDS, which has a much poorer prognosis...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} {{with the development of}} hydrops and affecting its clinical outcome. METHODS: Chart review of all patients with acute hydrops seen by a referral cornea service during a 2. 5 -year period between June 1996 and December 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 eyes) with acute hydrops were seen. Nineteen patients had keratoconus, 2 had pellucid marginal degeneration, and 1 had <b>keratoglobus.</b> Twenty-one of 22 (95 %) eyes had seasonal allergies and 20 of 22 (91 %) eyes had allergy-associated eye-rubbing behavior. Six of 22 (27 %) had a diagnosis of Down's syndrome. Six patients were able to identify a traumatic inciting event: vigorous eye rubbing in 4 and traumatic contact lens insertion in 2. The affected area ranged from 7 % to 100 % of the corneal surface area and was related to disease duration and final visual acuity. Proximity of the area of edema to the corneal limbus ranged from 0 to 2. 3 mm and was also related to prognosis. Three serious complications were observed: a leak, an infectious keratitis, and an infectious keratitis and coincidental neovascular glaucoma. Various medical therapies did not differ significantly in their effect on outcome, and ultimately 4 (18 %) of 22 patients underwent penetrating keratoplasty. Best-corrected visual acuity was equal to or better than prehydrops visual acuity in 5 of the 6 patients in whom prehydrops visual acuity was known, without corneal transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Allergy and eye-rubbing appear to be important risk factors in the development of hydrops. Visual results are acceptable in some patients without surgery. Close observation allows for the early detection and treatment of complications such as perforation and infection...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion {{from human}} corneas with different pathology {{and to establish}} whether cytokine profile influences corneal graft outcome. Method: Secretion of both proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 1 α and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α was measured after cultivation of 47 corneas collected from corneal graft recipients suffering from different corneal diseases. Non-inflammatory corneal diseases were keratoconus (n = 8), <b>keratoglobus</b> (n = 2), bullous keratopathy (n = 11), and Groenouw stromal dystrophy type II (n = 2), whereas inflammatory included vascularized corneal scar (n = 14), rejected graft (n = 6), and corneal ulcer (n = 4). Corneas were cultivated at 37 °C for 24 hours and frozen until cytokine detection was measured by immunoassay. Donor corneas unsuitable for transplantation were used as controls (n = 7). Corneal graft recipients were followed at least 18 months and rejection rate was calculated for each group. Results: The median concentration of IL- 1 α secreted from corneas of recipients with non-inflammatory diseases was 2. 47 pg/mm 3 (range, 0. 13 - 9. 95). In inflammatory corneal diseases, IL- 1 α concentration was significantly higher (median, 5. 92 pg/mm 3; range, 0. 48 - 12. 68; P = 0. 005). IL- 1 α production in controls (median, 0. 63 pg/mm 3; range, 0. 36 - 1. 29 pg/mm 3) was significantly lower than in inflammatory corneal diseases (P< 0. 001) and non-inflammatory diseases (P = 0. 008). Low level of TNF-α was detected only in 5 cases of vascularized corneal scars, 3 cases of bullous keratopathy, and 3 cases of graft rejection. Rejection rate was significantly higher in inflammatory than in non-inflammatory group (46 % vs < 10 %, respectively, P = 0. 008). IL- 1 α and TNF-α were absent from all patient’s sera, confirming its local intra-ocular production. Conclusion: Increased production of IL- 1 α in corneal recipients with inflammatory diseases suggests its role in corneal graft rejection in humans...|$|E
