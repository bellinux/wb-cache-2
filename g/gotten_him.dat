5|$|While Cipriano {{worked on}} the piece, he and his editors, Jonathan Neumann and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Rosenthal, were {{contacted}} by Tierney. Tierney accused Ralph Cipriano of using inaccurate facts, trespassing and creating a protest at the Archdiocese's vacation home in Ventnor City, New Jersey, all of which Cipriano denies. Cipriano says that Tierney indicated to {{him that it was}} the Archdiocese that had <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> removed from the religion reporter position, a position Cipriano says he thought he left on his own. Also according to Cipriano, Tierney indicated that if Cipriano was involved in any story about the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Tierney would start a public relations campaign to ruin Cipriano and The Philadelphia Inquirer, a charge that Tierney denies.|$|E
25|$|Kiki Jerome is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network. The role was originated by Kristen Alderson in 2013 when Kiki was introduced as the troublesome girlfriend of Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) having <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> involved in dangerous gambling ring. Alderson had previously {{appeared in the}} series as Starr Manning, a role she originated on One Life to Live. The character was first written into the series as the illegitimate daughter of Franco (originally James Franco) in 2009. Upon her introduction in 2013, Kiki's mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) reveals {{that she is the}} biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). In early 2015, Alderson vacated the role and was replaced by Hayley Erin.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{convention}} managers {{sought a}} Southerner as vice presidential candidate, {{to balance the}} ticket. Clay disciples such as John M. Clayton of Delaware, Willie Mangum of North Carolina and Virginia's Benjamin Watkins Leigh were discussed, but all of Clay's close associates refused or {{were believed to be}} unwilling to run. Former senator John Tyler of Virginia, a onetime Democrat who had broken with Jackson over states' rights, had been a regional Whig candidate for vice president in 1836, and had supported Clay at the convention. Harrison, out of communication in distant North Bend, was not consulted. Weed's assistant, Horace Greeley, later claimed Tyler had wept at Clay's defeat, and this had <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> the nomination. The vote was unanimous, but Virginia's ballots were not cast. Diarist Philip Hone, following President Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841, would write of Tyler's nomination, [...] "there was rhyme, but no reason to it". [...] Michael F. Holt, who in his history of the Whig Party chronicled President Tyler's departure from it, noted, [...] "the choice of Tyler would later prove to be a disaster".|$|E

2500|$|While The Observator, in particular, was a noted {{venue for}} anti-Jacobite opinion, Tutchin's {{tendency}} toward paranoid-seeming fears and suspicions {{about the government}} had <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> few contemporary friends. [...] Even after his death under suspicious circumstances, he was not widely mourned, and Alexander Pope, in particular, memorialized him viciously in The Dunciad a full seventeen years after his death, where he has the publisher Edmund Curll given a gift of a tapestry by Dulness showing the fates of dunces, where the whipping of Tutchin through the west country is a featured panel.|$|E
2500|$|The boys {{sometimes}} take it {{upon themselves}} to travel to Chef's house individually to seek his advice on all manners of their problems, specifically relationships. He usually gives advice {{in the form of a}} soul song, which usually winds up being about sex, whether or not sex was relevant to the topic at hand. Hearing the songs would often leave the boys even more confused and with no further understanding of what they initially inquire about. In earlier seasons, Chef is often approached by the children when they are unfamiliar with a term that pertains to adult matters, such as [...] "lesbian" [...] or [...] "prostitute". This happens so often that it eventually aggravates Chef, who pleads with them to stop asking questions he feels are not appropriate for him to answer. Despite this, the children continue asking these questions, much to his chagrin. An absent-minded Chef sometimes answers anyway, not realizing his lapse until the damage had been done. Chef acknowledges that doing this had repeatedly <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> in trouble with his boss, Principal Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|Roast Beef had a desperately {{unhappy and}} impoverished childhood, ranging from simple {{lack of food}} due to poverty to an {{incident}} where he overheard his mother killing his father, apparently in self-defense. He does not like to discuss his childhood, generally referring to it simply by saying he is [...] "from Circumstances". Beef has seemingly incurable depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and/or Avoidant personality disorder, and considers suicide often, though {{no one seems to}} care. Recently however, his depression seems to have improved, particularly since he met Molly. Molly has also <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> a light therapy lamp, which helps when he remembers to use it. For a long time he lived in a trailer with his abusive grandmother, Gramma K., but has since moved out of the trailer and into Ray's pool shed. His speech balloons use a slightly smaller font than that of other characters and rarely include punctuation, to emphasize his timidity and unique manner of speech. Roast Beef possesses an impressive vocabulary and will, on occasion, sprinkle words such as [...] "insatiable", [...] "phenomena", or [...] "corpulent" [...] into his normally slang-filled dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Middle East in December 1914, the New Zealanders {{undertook}} further training, before {{taking part in the}} Landing at Anzac Cove as part of the Gallipoli campaign on 25 April 1915. The Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment (including the Southland Squadron) did not take part in the initial landing; instead they were sent as dismounted reinforcements the following month. It seems, however, that Travis, was not scheduled to proceed with rest of the Southland Mounted Rifles Squadron, presumably having been assigned to a rear detail or reserve party that was to remain in Egypt until called for later on. Nevertheless, exhibiting the same disregard for discipline that had <b>gotten</b> <b>him</b> in trouble earlier in his life, he took it upon himself to stow away upon the squadron's transport and joined them on the Gallipoli Peninsula. His unauthorised presence was soon discovered and disciplinary proceedings followed with Travis being returned to Egypt and receiving 14 days' confinement. Nevertheless, he was later able to return to Gallipoli {{to take part in the}} final month of the campaign before the Allied forces were evacuated in December 1915, and while at ANZAC Cove he established a reputation as a fine soldier who possessed the ability to move through [...] "no man's land" [...] unscathed.|$|E
