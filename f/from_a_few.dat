They range <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.|$|E

5|$|Lepidopterans {{range in}} size <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> millimetres in length, {{such as in the}} case of microlepidoptera, to a {{wingspan}} of many inches, such as the Atlas moth and the world's largest butterfly Queen Alexandra's birdwing.|$|E
5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E

5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild {{animals such as}} Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E

There are no formal {{academic}} requirements {{for entry into}} RNC, but potential students are invited to attend an assessment at the college before being offered a place to determine the level of support they will need during their studies. The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and numeracy skills tests, and {{an interview with the}} leader of the course they wish to take.|$|E
5|$|Early {{versions}} of Slash {{were written by}} Rob Malda, co-founder of Slashdot, {{in the spring of}} 1998. After Andover.net bought Slashdot in June 1999, several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred to tens of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith and Chris Nandor, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001. Slash remains Free software and anyone can contribute to development.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils {{are referred to}} Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described {{on the basis of}} a single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Russian {{president}} Boris Yeltsin disclosed five top-secret memos dating <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{weeks after}} the downing of KAL007 in 1983. The memos contained Soviet communications (from KGB Chief Viktor Chebrikov and Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov to General Secretary Yury Andropov) that indicated that they knew the location of KAL007's wreckage while they were simulating a search and harassing the American Navy; they had found the sought-after cockpit voice recorder on October 20, 1983 (50 days after the incident), and had decided to keep this knowledge secret, the reason being that the tapes could not unequivocally support their firmly held view that KAL007's flight to Soviet territory was a deliberately planned intelligence mission.|$|E
5|$|In May 1904, he {{received}} a first class BA in mathematics. Aside <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months spent on holidays with family and friends, Keynes continued to involve himself with the university {{over the next two}} years. He took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted his only formal education in the subject. He also studied for Tripos in 1905 and, the following year took civil service exams.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Recommissioned on 17 November 1898, with Commander Charles S. Sperry in command, Yorktown sailed {{again for}} the Far East on 7 January 1899.

On 23 February, she arrived at Cavite Navy Yard, near Manila where patrolled to prevent gun-runners thought to be supplying guns and ammunition to the Insurrectos, Filipinos fighting for independence.|$|E
