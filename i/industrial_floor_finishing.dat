40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{development}} of building industry and the increasing demand for building materials together compose {{the emergence of new}} warehouse centers. This trend enables building materials to be delivered more efficiently and within shorter time, thus making them more cost-attractive. At the same time, the sustainable development policy causes new materials and solutions to become more favorable by decreasing the amount of materials applied and reducing the energy consumption in industrial buildings. Concrete <b>industrial</b> <b>floors</b> must meet a number of requirements such as limited cracking, flatness and sufficient load-bearing capacity. Besides redundancy and visual aspects, the <b>industrial</b> <b>floors</b> are also required to show good thermal performance. The development and application of foamed concrete layer, due to its mechanical performance and thermal properties seem to be an adequate solution as substructure layer for <b>industrial</b> <b>floors.</b> The article shows results of numerical simulations of concrete <b>industrial</b> <b>floor</b> with foam concrete layer as substructure.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a methodology for designing slabs on grade for <b>industrial</b> <b>floors</b> {{where there is}} an eccentricity between the slab centroid and the gravity centre loads of the loaded axle of forklift trucks travelling over the floor. An example was used for analysing how Portland Cement Association (PCA) and the Wire Reinforcement Institute (WRI) methods are inadequate for designing floors sublected to this condition. The new proposal for designing slabs on grade for <b>industrial</b> <b>floors</b> {{has been called the}} Camero method. An example of an <b>industrial</b> <b>floor</b> designed to be capable of sustaining an infinite number of load applications (or 50 -year life) was compared to the results of the Camero method and PCA and WRI’s simplified methods. <b>Industrial</b> <b>floors</b> should be capable of sustaining an infinite number of load applications (50 -year life) if designed with the Camero method; on the other hand, if designed using PCA and WRI methods they will only last one year (in this example the number of axle load applications in a 1 -year period was equal to the number of allowable repetitions) because {{they will not be able}} to sustain an infinite number of load applications. It was concluded that designing plain concrete slabs (without reinforcement) on grade according to PCA and the WRI methods leads to slab fatigue, even though extreme fibre stress should not exceed 50 percent (50 %) of static modulus of concrete rupture and slabs should sustain an infinite number of load repetitions (infinite amount of forklift truck traffic) were considered parameters in their design...|$|R

40|$|Flooring {{materials}} have a considerable {{impact on the}} indoor environment of healthcare facilities. In recent years, flooring options such as vinyl flooring and vinyl composite tiles have emerged as a popular choice in such facilities. They have been preferred extensively because of properties that make them durable, resistant to infections, and easy to maintain with minimum expenditure. However, there is limited literature and research which comprehensively evaluates <b>floor</b> <b>finishes</b> and their selection criteria in healthcare environments and the opinion of facility managers regarding the same. This study analyzed, identified and systematized literature on selection criteria for flooring in healthcare facilities. It found out the preferences of healthcare facility managers regarding <b>floor</b> <b>finishes</b> and their selection criteria and assigned empirical values to their opinions and carried out further analysis. This research investigated literature on different types of <b>floor</b> <b>finishes</b> currently used in healthcare facilities and the criteria applied for their selection. The literature review {{for this study was}} conducted through search engines using relevant keywords. Peer-reviewed studies and articles published between 2000 and 2016 and consistent with the research design were included.

30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> material or covering.

Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient <b>floor</b> <b>finishing</b> material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare <b>floor</b> without <b>finishing.</b>|$|R

40|$|All form of {{activity}} in a building is in need for a sound platform {{to be able to}} operate. The performance of concrete <b>floor</b> in <b>industrial</b> spaces is of importance because there are greater demands on <b>industrial</b> concrete <b>floor.</b>   By making sure that the necessary recommendation regarding casting an <b>industrial</b> concrete <b>floor</b> is followed, the risk for failure is reduced. The Swedish Concrete Association (2008) recommends a w/c ratio of approximately 0. 55 for <b>industrial</b> <b>floors.</b> This would result in a concrete strength class of C 30 / 37 with an abrasive resistance adequate for most <b>industrial</b> <b>floors.</b> From an economical perspective an approach for concrete rehabilitation is the bonded overlay, which has been used for many years and has the intension to extend the life of structural concrete slabs. For concrete overlay having a matching material to the substrate is the main recommendation, in addition in a fully bonded overlay to the substrate there is less risk for cracking and edge lifting. From a mechanical perspective a crack develops when the stresses in concrete exceeds the tensile strength. Shrinkage and creep of concrete in both overlays and <b>industrial</b> <b>floors</b> are important factors that contribute in development of cracks which have considerable effect on failure of the structure; therefore it is useful to find an accurate prediction model to predict shrinkage and creep. The literature study that has been carried out in this thesis is mainly about shrinkage, creep, <b>industrial</b> <b>floor,</b> overlays and tensile stress prediction. In addition the following calculation models for prediction of creep and shrinkage of concrete have been reviewed in this paper: Eurocode 2, fib Model Code 2010, ACI 209 R- 92, Swedish code BBK 04 and Swedish concrete manual Material. In order to study the differences between the mentioned models two example cases for calculation of shrinkage and creep in <b>industrial</b> <b>floor</b> and  bonded overlay with the mentioned methods have been carried out, also the tensile stress development in bonded overlay has been calculated according to a method proposed by Prof. Silfwerbrand (1997). Since {{it was not possible to}} consider all types of concrete and conditions which will affect the outcome, only one type of concrete C 30 / 37 with w/c ratio of 0. 55 for <b>industrial</b> <b>floor</b> and w/c ratio of 0. 40 for overlay is taken as an example in this thesis. Some of these methods take only a few factors into consideration; however the others are more detailed and treat numerous factors. The simple methods such as BBK 04 or the graph in Eurocode 2 for calculating the creep coefficient can be used in the lack of existence of sufficient input parameters to be able to roughly estimate the final value. The predicted shrinkage did differ by using different models, however the final value of the creep coefficient was quiet similar regardless of the used model. There are some important parameters such as ambient relative humidity, age at loading, duration of drying and duration of loading which should be included in predicting models since these parameters affect shrinkage and creep considerably. Also aggregate type has an important role in both creep and shrinkage; however aggregate type (modulus of elasticity of aggregate) was not included in any of the studied models. Choosing a factor according to the type of aggregate might be helpful for better prediction...|$|R
