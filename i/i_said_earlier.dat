"With {{the release}} of Unexpected, Williams has welcomed R back into her arms with a modern edge, a la Rihanna and Chris Brown, infusing her soulful lyrics with party beats and dance-like synths. Take the lead single, for instance. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] is an immensely catchy mid-tempo jam co-written by Williams and ex-Child Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles. The track re-launched the {{ebullient}} singer back into the mainstream, sporting a new, edgy electronica look and sound. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] has {{a certain amount of}} memorability in the synth riff and the laid-back party lyrics. The song is carefree, and {{a far cry from the}} depth of Gospel music. The album features a collection of [...] "moods" [...] including the bouncy tracks [...] "Hello Heartbreak," [...] hilariously including [...] "It's time for the percolator" [...] as the bridge, and [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] once the smooth intro stops. These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries. Another mood of Unexpected is the party jam feel exhibited by [...] "Private Party" [...] and [...] "Hungover," [...] the tracks you jam while driving down the road with your windows down. [...] "The Greatest," [...] a fantastic pop ballad, and [...] "Thank U," [...] a melodic song about thanking what held you down so you can appreciate how far you've come, round out the heavier, and slower, moods on the album.

The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation.

So here is a dilemma which others have suffered before us, and for which as far as I can see there is simply no escape. Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot.

Unfortunately that has not happened. But there are many, many friends of Croatia now the situation is more fully realised. (...) I must make it quite clear, in my view, the West should be on the side of liberty and democracy and justice.

5000|$|Thornton Wilder {{said that}} the book poses the question: [...] "Is there a {{direction}} and meaning in lives beyond the individual's own will?" [...] Describing the sources of his novel, Wilder explained that the plot was inspired in its external action by a one-act play Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement by French playwright Prosper Mérimée, which takes place in Latin America and one of whose characters is a courtesan. However, the central idea of the work, the justification {{for a number of}} human lives that comes up {{as a result of the}} sudden collapse of a bridge, stems from friendly arguments with my father, a strict Calvinist. Strict Puritans imagine God all too easily as a petty schoolmaster who minutely weights guilt against merit, and they overlook God's 'Caritas' which is more all-encompassing and powerful. God's love has to transcend his just retribution. But in my novel I have left this question unanswered. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> we can only pose the question correctly and clearly, and have faith one will ask the question in the right way. When asked if his characters were historical or imagined, Wilder replied, [...] "The Perichole and the Viceroy are real people, under the names they had in history street singer named Micaela Villegas. Most of the events were invented by me, including the fall of the bridge." [...] He based the Marquesa's habit of writing letters to her daughter on his knowledge of the great French letter-writer, Madame de Sévigné.|$|E

The center of Wagner's argument is that the use of verbally assessed beliefs as an independent measure of a representation which can be used to predict some subsequent behaviour reflects the importation of a misplaced intentionality into s ci l representations research.

40|$|A {{new model}} for land use {{planning}} Cue: Africa is well known as a continent rich in natural resources. However, if those resources are to bring prosperity and development, how they are used and managed is clearly critical. But who {{has the right to}} decide how the resources should be used? Local communities? Town councils? Government ministries or planning departments? An obvious answer is that it depends on who owns the land, but in many areas ownership is disputed. In much of rural South Africa, as elsewhere, two different systems of land ownership exist side-by-side, the formal system based on legal documents, and traditional systems rooted in local culture. Not surprisingly, reaching agreements on how land should be used in this context can be extremely difficult, and may lead to open conflict. According to Pat Luckin, a land use planner working in South Africa, preventing conflict and developing agreement over land use depends on involving local communities in planning, and creating better communication between the communities and other interest groups. In recent work with two communities, Pat has experimented with a new approach which she believes has greatly improved that communication process, and has given people a much better understanding of the resources that they have. She spoke to Susanna Thorp about the new approach and the way it has been used. IN:		?I {{think the most important thing}} ? OUT:		? reduction of conflict in certain areas. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Pat Luckin, on some new approaches to {{land use planning}} that have recently been piloted in South Africa. Transcript Luckin	I think the most important thing to realise when one deals with planning processes is trust, and that people participate in the planning process. Now that?s quite difficult with the formal planning tools that we have which are quite abstract and often come from other countries and sometimes aren?t applicable to our local conditions. So what we?ve done is we built three-dimensional models, physical models, so people can physically see the land and touch a model. Immediately people then identify where they live, where their schools are, where the rivers are, where the hills are, where the forests are etc. Thorp	So how has that made a difference in the way that people have worked together and if they have identified these things, how have they then used those results? Luckin	What we have done in our communities is we have brought people together, traditional leaders, women, other community members, people with disabilities, to make sure that we have a good range of people living in that particular area and ensure that they can participate on how land in that particular area should be used. Obviously one does this in an area where people are demanding a change in land use or more appropriate land use or where there are some conflicts in land use and people need to resolve these problems. So bring all the different parties together around the model and they just start discussing how they want to use different pieces of land. Thorp	Now you mentioned that there had previously been a lot of conflict. Has this process allowed some of those conflicts to be resolved, can you give me examples? Luckin	Often when one has large areas of land, like particularly in South Africa, there is often distrust or lack of communication between different sectors of communities, between traditional leaders and municipalities, and what these particular projects have facilitated is that by bringing the people together around the model, we?ve had municipal officials, we?ve had traditional leaders, we?ve had elders and women all talking around the same issues and agreeing and understanding one another. And I think that the modeling process has huge potential for helping people to genuinely communicate with one another and realise that they are much closer to one another than they had thought before, and that they all have the same intention which is the management of land and the development of a particular area concerned. Thorp	So a very powerful tool obviously, but you?ve only used it in two communities? Luckin		Very small, yes. Thorp	How would you take this process on now? Are there lessons that you have learned that you would perhaps do differently or is this something that you would like to try elsewhere? Luckin	Oh yes well the responsibility of using models in a community are very huge. So as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> they must be based on trust. There is certain information in communities relating to biodiversity, relating to plants and animals which have specific significance to communities which they might not want to divulge and they have the right to keep that information private and within the community and not make it public, particularly relating to medicinal plants where people invariably get exploited. Next time I go into a community we would write up protocols of how the information would be managed, who would own the information, how much of it would become mapped in a public map for public consumption and how much of it would be kept within the community. It does not solve all problems there are obviously lots of other land legal problems which require other kinds of solutions but it definitely can facilitate the reduction of conflict in certain areas.

40|$|Increasing {{biosecurity}} when outbreaks occur Cue: Cross-border {{trade in}} poultry and poultry products {{is big business}} in much of Africa. However despite being {{a good source of}} income for the traders, and a valuable source of meat and eggs for consumers, there can be risks in this cross-border trade. Spreading disease from one country to another is one risk. For example, when Nigeria first experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu in early 2006, neighbouring countries became very concerned. For this reason, when outbreaks of contagious livestock disease occur, governments can decide to impose a ban on all imports of the livestock concerned, at least until the outbreak is controlled. However, few governments are can make import bans completely effective; they lack the trained staff to do it. Controlling movements of livestock within a country is even more difficult. But controlling diseases like avian flu is in everyone?s interest, and it is everyone?s responsibility to prevent the disease spreading. Farmers, for instance, must know {{the right thing to do}} if they suspect one or more of their birds has caught or died from the virus. In a recent interview, Excello Zidana spoke to Michael Nkosi, a lecturer at Malawi?s Natural Resources College, and began by asking what farmers should do if one of their birds shows symptoms of the virus. IN:		?I would advise that the ?? OUT:		??Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And asking the questions was Excello Zidana. The interview comes from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Nkosi	I would advise that the first thing that farmers should do is actually to report to the nearest veterinary station. That is the first thing, so that maybe officers should come, verify the signs and symptoms, if there is need undertake sampling, take birds to the lab and then they would do analysis. But unfortunately in Malawi we may not have the capacity to test for avian influenza. But the other thing that farmers need to do is to intensify bio-security measures. They should not just allow their workers to move from house to house if they have several units of birds. Maybe they should allocate specific attendants to a specific house so that the virus is not passed on to safe birds. Zidana		How does the virus spread? Nkosi	The virus can spread in many ways. It could be from inanimate objects like farm equipment. If you just borrow feeders from any how, drinkers from any unknown farm you can spread the virus. From clothes of people, boots [...] . So I should emphasise that protective wear is very important and should be specific to a unit. Zidana	Let?s look at the handling of the sick birds, how does a farmer handle sick birds from his farm? Nkosi	One, he should first of all isolate the sick birds, confine them separately. But at the same time he should put on protective wear, even a mask if it is available, because you never know, he maybe working with a strain of avian influenza virus that can affect man. So you need to be protected whether it is confirmed or not. Zidana	And if this farmer wants his dead birds to be tested from any lab around, how does he carry the dead bird? Nkosi	He can put the birds in a plastic bag that is having no holes or double plastic bag, the whole live bird push it there and then transport it to the lab. As <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> on that in this country we do not have the capacity to examine and diagnose for this virus. Then the lab knows how to safely package international samples to referral labs. Zidana	Now let?s turn to disposing of the dead birds. How should the process of disposing of the dead birds carried out? Nkosi	If it is by mass slaughter, if it is the government policy to say we want to control the outbreak by mass slaughter, one, you can bury very deep: two metres deep, three metres. Or you can dig a shallow pit and then push all the birds there, put diesel and then burn. Zidana		Why three metres Mr Nkosi? Nkosi	Because some carnivores like dogs, cats, jackals, they can jump into a shallow pit, lift the animal and then they can scavenge and spread the virus. Zidana	People who know avian flu very well have indicated that the virus can survive in birds? droppings. What measures should be taken when using items such as cages, bicycles or even vehicle tyres trying to go to an area where people suspect that there could be this outbreak? Nkosi	The first thing is to institute wheel baths just outside the farm. You need to have a wheel bath that has disinfectant and as the vehicle is moving across all the manure will remain there. But at the same time you need to spray the whole vehicle canopy, even the tyres, so that you do not take the manure. Because you never know, you can carry the virus. About the facilities like cages, you need to decontaminate and remove all the manure if it is there, so that you move a safe product. Zidana	In countries like Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, people know that birds migrate from one region to another. Are there special rules to guard maybe the movement of wild birds from one country to another, as a region or as a continent? Nkosi	That is a very tricky question. You know natural birds, you cannot govern them, but you definitely know the routes that they take from one continent to the other. The only bet is actually to avoid contact of domesticated birds with the wild birds along the shores of Lake Malawi or any other ocean in this region. We need to advise our farmers, maybe to intensively rear birds that are domestic to avoid that contact. Zidana	Lastly how or what do you advise people involved in business of poultry, cross-border business people trying to bring in maybe birds or meat from birds? What do you advise them to do if they are doing that in the event of rumours that there should be avian flu within the region? Nkosi	The only advice that I can give is they need to follow proper protocol. Get all the licenses for importation. They should desist from smuggling because avian influenza can not only affect their consumers; even themselves if it is brought into this country, we are all at risk. So what we need to do is desist from smuggling or black marketing and then follow proper channels. Zidana	That was Mr Michael Nkosi who is an Animal Scientist at Natural Resources College, thank you Mr Nkosi. Nkosi		Thank you very much. End of track. How farmers and traders can minimise the risk of a widespread outbreak...|$|E
40|$|Cue: When rain only {{falls for}} a few months each year, it is very tempting for farming {{families}} to try to store some of that rainfall for use during the dry months. Water storage tanks, both above ground and under ground, are one answer. Some collect water from roof tops, while others collect run off from the ground. Man made ponds, sometimes called charco dams, are another option. Depending on the soil type these may need to be lined with a plastic sheet, to prevent the water being lost. But how affordable are these technologies for smallholder farmers? Can they afford to build them individually or is it best to work as a group? And what technical support will farmers need to build them? In general these structures are a more expensive system of rainwater harvesting, and most farmers will need some technical help in building them, or else they may quickly crack and leak and become useless. Simon Mkwinda is the Chief Land Resources Conservation Officer in the Malawian Department of Land Resources. He spoke to Excello Zidana about how families can use tanks and ponds to harvest rainwater, and began by explaining that {{there are two types of}} water storage tanks. IN:		?Basically there are two types of tanks ?? OUT:		??change the materials to make them low cost. ? DUR?N:	 7 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Simon Mkwinda of the Department of Land Resources in Malawi, explaining that structures for storing rainwater, such as tanks and ponds, do not have to be very expensive. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mkwinda	Basically there are two types of tanks. The first one is what we call ?above ground tanks?. They are constructed of course using different materials but mostly bricks with cement. And in most cases we advocate construction of this type of tank for domestic uses. Then the second type is what we call ?underground water tanks?. This involves digging a pit in different shapes, but in most cases we advocate what they call hemispherical shape because these are proved to be strong enough to store large quantities of water. Now in terms of catchments that we use for collecting water from on the ground, mostly they could be rock outcrops or even any cultivated area where it is a source of runoff. Now instead of this runoff just flowing uncontrolled on the ground, we advocate that the runoff should be channelled to these tanks to store the water for usage later on. But by doing so, the construction of these tanks, it means they are assisting in reducing the amount of runoff that would otherwise would be flowing on the ground uncontrolled thereby causing erosion, soil erosion. So by constructing these tanks in a way we are also trying to help in controlling soil erosion which is rampant in the country. Zidana	How would you look at the materials used for constructing tanks. You talked of cement. Is it feasible for a local farmer to construct these things? Mkwinda	Yes at face value you may say these technologies are expensive and farmers may not be able to afford. But there are different methods of constructing these structures. For example if you are talking of an underground tank, depending on the condition of the soils you are dealing with, instead of using materials like cement and bricks or reinforcement wires, chicken wires and the like, you may do just with a plastic sheet. Because the idea is to keep water and you want to prevent seepage of water that has collected in the tank. At the same time, some of the rooftops you may construct using iron sheets. Iron sheets are very expensive. But then you can modify that. You can just provide a plastic sheet or even just grass. Because the idea is that you want to reduce evaporation of that water that you have stored in that tank. So there are those modifications which can make the whole thing cheaper and manageable by smallholder farmers. But most important of all, let?s not look at rainwater harvesting single-handedly, or in isolation. We have to empower farming communities with other initiatives that would assist them in generating income, so that some of these technologies they can adopt them quite easily. For example, World vision in Chingale. They are integrating in their programme issues that would bring a lot of income to the communities, like getting them involved in seed multiplication. The income they get from the seed multiplication programme is enabling the communities to source some of the materials on their own, as individuals or groups. Zidana	What do you encourage farmers to do when they are thinking of constructing or having ponds? Mkwinda	Pond construction is another technology that we are promoting among smallholder farmers, and you construct it in a strategic place, particularly near low-lying areas. The idea being that once you dig out a pond you should be able to let water, run off, to settle in that one, and the farmers should be able to utilise that water for different uses. If it is in low land it would be more ideal for irrigation, it may be ideal for fish farming. But then like I said, it depends on the conditions of the area where you are constructing these ponds. Sometimes it may be necessary for you to line the pond with plastic sheets to reduce seepage of the water. Zidana		Do you see this technology to be good for farmers or worth promoting? Mkwinda	It is worthwhile to promote it. In Malawi we have adequate rain for a limited number of months in a year, or in a season. We are talking of maybe at most 4 months of receiving rain. The other months are dry months. If we don?t develop a culture of storing the water we receive in that short period, then year after year we will be crying that we are unable to do A, B, C, D, because we don?t have water. This technology is coming into fill that gap. Let farmers harvest the rainwater as much as we can so that the stored water can be utilised for different purposes, domestic, livestock watering, irrigation, you name it. But then I should also mention that, yes, in our discussion here we have just looked at the structures. Those are the ones that we normally say are very expensive, because they require farmers to spend a lot of money. But there are other technologies we call in situ rainwater harvesting technologies which can be done right in the field, which are low cost, very simple, farmers can do them on their own, of course with guidance from extension workers. Zidana		Can you cite some examples? Mkwinda	Examples of these include pit planting, where you dig pits in the field, then you apply manure in those pits. The idea being after the rains have fallen most of the rains collect in those pits, and then you come and plant your crop in those pits. In this way you are assisting the crop to grow up so well because you have stored water in those pits. Another example is what we call swales. Swales are nothing other than small trenches that you dig on a contour in a field at a pre-determined interval. The idea is instead of runoff just flowing overland you store the runoff in those trenches, with the idea of recharging the soil profile, so that whatever crop you grow in that field should not suffer from moisture stress, especially in periods of dry spell. There are so many other technologies like water infiltration pits, rainwater harvesting from roadsides, whereby instead of just losing the water into drains, you channel the water into a field where you can grow a crop. Those are some of the techniques which are low cost, which we are already promoting. But like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier,</b> even the structures, you can try to modify them to suit the socio-economic status of the communities that you are dealing with, by modifying their design. You can change the materials to make them low cost. End of track. Ponds and underground water tanks can store large quantities of water for domestic or agricultural purposes...|$|E
40|$|Since I was {{appointed}} to the office of Minister of State at the Department of Health, over 15 months ago, I have been privileged to see and hear at close quarters the outstanding work being conducted by dedicated people and organisations up and down the country. And I have witnessed the tremendous commitment and effort of those working hard to get their lives back on track, and away from the scourge of drugs and alcohol addiction and misuse. Soon after taking up this role I announced the conclusions of a review of the Drugs Task Forces undertaken by the Department at the request of my predecessor in office. That Review recommended a series of reforms to better equip the Drugs Task Forces in their response to the current pattern of substance misuse. The key changes proposed included: •Drugs Task Forces to be renamed “Drug and Alcohol Task Forces” reflecting their current role in tackling substance misuse, including alcohol; •a National Coordinating Committee to be established, to guide the work of the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, and to ensure the ongoing implementation of the National Drugs Strategy; •clearer terms of reference and corporate governance guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; •measures to encourage more Public Representative involvement in the work of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; and •a review of the number and boundaries of Drugs Task Forces, mainly in Dublin. While other important matters have been progressed, the implementation of these specific recommendations has been delayed until now for a number of reasons. Later this morning, our colleague Susan Scally will outline the role of the new National Co-ordinating Committee – prescribed in that report – and how we intend to proceed with the implementation of the various recommendations over the coming months. I am happy to confirm this morning that the new Co-ordinating Committee is due to hold its inaugural meeting this day week, January 23 rd. I have no doubt that while these recommendations will take some time to take hold, ultimately they will foster a much greater sense of cohesion between the national structures and the Drugs Task Forces. This increased cohesion will, I hope, facilitate a constant two-way flow of information, with policy makers, and practitioners on the ground, working together and learning from one another, providing each other with valuable insights into their work. This, as you know, {{was one of the main}} reasons for adopting an inter-agency approach in the first place. So we must strive together to ensure that this method is maintained, and improved where possible, in order more effectively to tackle emerging issues, recognise new challenges, and advance new practices. Early in 2013, I had the opportunity to oversee the delivery of the 2012 Progress Report on the 2009 - 2016 National Drugs Strategy. Despite some reservations on my part, I think that Progress Report very clearly demonstrates that significant progress has been made on strategic goals across the five central pillars of the national strategy. The Progress Report also emphasised the potential of a sustained partnership approach in achieving even greater success. However, it was clear also that there was a need for me as Minister to embark on a programme of formal meetings with all of the key contributors to the National Drugs Strategy - to take a step back from the daily challenges, and figure out how we can renew, or breath new life into this collective commitment which has been so essential to the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy. This, I understand, was the first time since 2009 that such a comprehensive engagement with all of the parties has been undertaken. I am pleased to say that we have now completed a full programme, concluding just yesterday morning when I had a very useful and informative meeting with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochana. The bilateral meetings presented an opportunity for the main players to reaffirm their commitment to their own respective roles. Most importantly, they offered the chance to explore where relationships across agencies and departments, offices and services, could be deepened and strengthened. In her presentation this morning my colleague Susan Scally will summarise the principal outcomes of that consultation process. And here I would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the DPU team at the Department, led by Susan Scally - not just for facilitating that process, but also for their sterling work in arranging today’s conference. With any strategy implemented over such a long period and, as in this case, involving such frequent changes in leadership, it can be hard to maintain momentum. However, what I have found without exception, is an absolute and resolute commitment to realising the core Strategy objectives across the five pillars. I have also encountered a genuine resolve to tackle obstacles that may stand in the way of progress. For example: •Minister Joan Burton’s flexibility regarding the purpose of the CE Scheme, and her willingness to engage with stakeholders to pilot new models which could be of real benefit to our sector, •or Minister Frances Fitzgerald, whose work will transform our focus on services to children, with considerable potential also for our agenda. I have also heard from the community and voluntary sectors, many of whose members are coming forward with progressive ideas and innovative thinking, such as: •the willingness of the voluntary sector to promote open procurement of public funding; •innovations within the prison services, and their keen awareness of the obstacles faced by those seeking a substance-free life after release; and •the balanced conversation promoted by the community sector on the issue of decriminalisation. I am greatly encouraged in my belief that despite significant ongoing problems on funding and resources, much can, and will be achieved throughout the latter half of the Strategy’s implementation. Alcohol In my first year as Minister of State at the Department of Health, I worked steadfastly to deliver a package of measures to be included in the first ever Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. I was delighted when this was formally approved by Government, and I’d like to thank Dr. Tony Holohan and his dedicated team in the Department of Health for their hard work in helping make this happen. Government recognises the severe consequences of the misuse of alcohol – including deaths, injuries, and social and financial problems – and has determined to take action to address this problem. The package of measures to be implemented was the result of intensive discussions across Government departments and in the relevant Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. It will include provision for minimum unit pricing for alcohol products and the regulation of advertising and marketing of alcohol, as recommended in the National Substance Misuse Strategy. The Steering Group reported that 1. 5 million Irish drinkers drink in a harmful pattern. As you’re all aware, alcohol misuse remains one of our biggest challenges touching every community across the country. The statistics are stark: •Alcohol was responsible for at least 88 deaths every month in 2008; 1 in 4 deaths in young men were estimated to be due to alcohol, •Alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and in deliberate self-harm; it also increases the risk of more than 60 medical conditions – such as cancers; •It is associated with 2000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals; •Alcohol It is a trigger in a third of domestic abuse cases; •Figures from 2007, show that alcohol related illness costs the healthcare system € 1. 2 billion, and alcohol-related crime cost an estimated € 1. 19 billion. The principal objective of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will be to reduce Ireland’s excessive patterns of alcohol consumption from the 2011 average of over 11 litres of pure alcohol per year consumed per-capita, to the OECD average of 9. 1 litres of alcohol by 2020. By reducing alcohol consumption we can also reduce the social, economic and health harms associated with alcohol misuse. Recognising the significance of the Community and Voluntary sectors’ contribution to successive National Drugs Strategies, I hope that today we can begin to draw more closely on your valuable local experience and insights in order to address how we might realise this ambitious target. Unlike problem drug use, which historically has been clustered and correlated with other social problems and issues, alcohol problems are dispersed more evenly throughout society, although their impact is most acutely felt where there are other existing social and familial problems - for example poverty, family breakdown and child neglect and abuse. The Task Forces at this stage have a strong track record in bringing together key players in dealing with drug problems, and it now behoves us to find a way to deploy this experience more strategically in relation to alcohol, thereby building on strengths, and utilising capacities within a broader field. At government level we have been engaged in developing an across-the-board national response. Although good progress has been made, it is clear that this is a complex process, particularly having regard to issues such as sports funding, the broader economic dimension and jobs, as well as the fundamental public health imperative, which of course is our principal concern. In this respect, national government obviously needs to lead, and we will do so, but our efforts need to be complemented by a new commitment across society, including more localised, strategic initiatives. It seems to me that the Task Forces are in an ideal position to bring focus to this dimension. Given what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>earlier</b> about the less “clustered” character of the alcohol problem, it may be worth considering whether Task Forces might link together or as appropriate, with leaders from Local Councils, HSE, Gardaí, Child and Family Agency and other relevant interests to develop initiatives at regional or City levels (or large sub-city areas – for example Dublin North, Dublin South, Dublin West, Fingal, South Dublin County and Dunlaoghaire/Rathdown). This could facilitate initiatives for tackling alcohol problems as a mainstream issue in these larger areas, and in society more generally. I’m sure many of you have ideas that can be explored and developed, and I look forward very much to listening to your observations and insights. I also look forward to the presentations later from a number of contributors including: •the Alcohol Forum, •the Ballymun Local Task Drug Force, and •the Galway City Alcohol Strategy. They will each give us a brief insight into a number of local initiatives that have already commenced. I am also looking forward to learning more about the ‘Hello Sunday Morning’ initiative, which will illustrate the potential that social media can bring to reaching new audiences and changing our attitudes and behaviours. Your remarkable contribution stretches back to the pivotal intervention of the First Ministerial Task Force established by my colleague, Pat Rabbitte, in 1996. This was at the time of a real crisis – the heroin crisis - that so blighted our major urban communities. At the heart of that intervention was a principle, articulated by the Combat Poverty Agency and informed by research to the effect that:– “strategies, which consult with and actively encourage the involvement of local people are most likely to succeed”. Today, while some of the same challenges remain, our drug and alcohol problem has evolved significantly, and has become increasingly more complex. However, our core approach to tackling these problems endures, and must endure. So - I hope that as a result of today’s conference, you will: •learn and understand more about our new structures; •hear from our colleagues, who are using new and innovative techniques on the ground; •agree on common objectives and desired outcomes on our approach to alcohol misuse, •most importantly, I hope that today’s gathering will renew our collective faith in working together with common purpose, enabling us to meet today’s challenges head-on with progressive ideas, innovative thinking and renewed vigour.
