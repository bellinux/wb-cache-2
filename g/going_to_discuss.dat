Specifically, after the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, the system encountered with a significant change not only in the capital, Istanbul, but also in the provinces. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight these changes on the planning and design processes in the provinces in order to understand the multifaceted relationships among the central authority, provincial authority, the architects both in the capital and in the cit ies, and also contractors. The archival documents and the newly published data such as the translation of cost estimates books or the drawings of the buildings are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be used as the primary sources for this article. The sources are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>discussed</b> within a chronological and conceptual framework. In the first part of the article, the process of the construction and repair activities in the provinces, from the 16 th to the 19 th centuries, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>discussed</b> briefly. In the second part, the changes and developments in the Ottoman architectural organization after the Tanzimat era are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>discussed</b> within the light of the changing roles and responsibilities of the architects, kalfa s or contractors.
