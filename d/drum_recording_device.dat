Indirect and non-invasive methods of monitoring wildlife have therefore emerged as attractive alternatives due {{to their ability to}} collect data at large spatiotemporal scales using standardized remote sensing technologies. Here, we investigate the use of two novel passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems used to capture long-distance sounds produced by the same species, wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), living in two different habitats: forest (Taï, Côte d’Ivoire) and savanna-woodland (Issa valley, Tanzania). Results: Using data collected independently at two field sites, we show that detections of chimpanzee sounds on autonomous <b>recording</b> <b>devices</b> were predicted by direct and indirect indices of chimpanzee presence. At Taï, the number of chimpanzee buttress <b>drums</b> detected on <b>recording</b> <b>devices</b> was positively influenced by the number of hours chimpanzees were seen ranging within a 1 km radius of a device. We observed a similar but weaker relationship within a 500 m radius. At Issa, the number of indirect chimpanzee observations positively predicted detections of chimpanzee loud calls on a <b>recording</b> <b>device</b> within a 500 m but not a 1 km radius. Moreover, using just seven months of PAM data, we could locate two known chimpanzee communities in Taï and observed monthly spatial variation in the center of activity for each group. Conclusions: Our work shows PAM is a promising new tool for gathering information about the ranging behavior and habitat use of chimpanzees and can be easily adopted for other large territorial mammals, provided they produce long-distance acoustic signals that can be captured by autonomous <b>recording</b> <b>devices</b> (e. g., lions and wolves). With this study we hope to promote more interdisciplinary research in PAM to help overcome its challenges, particularly in data processing, to improve its wider application...|$|R
