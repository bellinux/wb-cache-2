5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers. A 1978 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> {{conducted}} around Albany found the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) occasionally visited Adenanthos cuneatus, while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985–86 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar-feeding honey possum occasionally eats it. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> {{that used}} {{molecular}} techniques to survey aquatic fungal taxa {{in a small}} springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many fungal taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, which suggests that a closely related species may also be common in streams.|$|E
5|$|A <b>field</b> <b>study</b> {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. TERENCE is an FP 7 ICT European {{project that}} {{developed}} a tech-nology enhanced learning system for supporting its learners, who are primary school children, and their educators. In {{the course of}} the project, we run <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> with a large number of learners for analysing the context of use of the system. This paper explains what triggered the gamification of the <b>field</b> <b>studies,</b> as well as how the <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> were conducted. It then explains how the gamified <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> were used to inform the early design of the TERENCE system. This paper ends by rummaging over the pros and contras of gamifying <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> as in TERENCE. ...|$|R
5|$|A <b>field</b> <b>study</b> in Brisbane {{found that}} F. rubiginosa trees often bore {{both male and}} female phase syconia at the same time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.|$|E
5|$|A <b>field</b> <b>study</b> of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a decade before.|$|E

40|$|Schools {{inspections}} {{investigation has}} shown that most pedagogues are experiencing significant challenges to stimulate students and to invite students to participate and to influence the teaching structure and content. This study is based in the school inspections school questionnaire from 2013 which shows that Vallentuna high school results in two categories stimulation as well as participation and influence gets a low index value compared to all participating school units. Previous research {{has shown that}} the <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> creates greater amount of stimulation, increases students’ participation and provide experience of a bigger influence. Careful preparations are also important and the right form of <b>field</b> <b>studies.</b> This study will be using a quantitative student questionnaire and qualitative interviews with teachers to examine how students value the <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> as stimulating methodology of teaching and if the participation and influence increases with the help of <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> outside of school. The study will also examine whether there are differences between students in different year. Vallentuna high school students experience <b>field</b> <b>studies,</b> more fun, more interesting and stimulating than usual schoolwork. At the same time raises <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> student participation and thereby creates favorable conditions for influence. Students’ perception of influence during <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> decreases the longer students study in high school. This study confirms the findings of the two categories are unchanged, but with the help of <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> can Vallentuna gymnasium raise students’ stimulation and participation.

5|$|Amanita regalis has {{the ability}} to {{bioaccumulate}} the heavy metal vanadium, a phenomenon first reported in Amanita muscaria in 1931. A <b>field</b> <b>study</b> of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119mg/kg). For comparison, the vanadium concentration in most other mushrooms is typically less than 2mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oblongifolia {{plants can}} live {{for more than}} 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the {{greatest}} number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One <b>field</b> <b>study</b> in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant.|$|E

5|$|A 1988 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> {{found that}} most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A <b>field</b> <b>study</b> conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E

5|$|A multi-year <b>field</b> <b>study</b> of {{the growth}} of R.emetica {{production}} in a scots pine plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms per hectare per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460kg per hectare per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4–7 days. In a study of the fungal diversity of ectomycorrhizal species in a Sitka spruce forest, R.emetica was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, R.emetica was most prolific in the latter.|$|E
