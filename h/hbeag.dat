5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. <b>HBeAg</b> is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein.

25|$|Vertical {{transmission}} {{is a significant}} contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries.

MethodsA total of 58 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with LdT continuously for 36 months were analyzed to determine any potential correlations between sex, age, baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBV DNA load, <b>HBeAg</b> titer, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) titer and end-of-treatment rates of ALT normalization, undetectable HBV DNA, <b>HBeAg</b> clearance, or <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion. The factors capable of predicting <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion were identified by logistic regression analysis. ResultsAfter 36 months of LdT treatment, the ALT normalization rate was 84. 48 %, the undetectable HBV DNA rate was 70. 69 %, the <b>HBeAg</b> clearance rate was 50. 0 %, and the <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion rate was 43. 1 %. The undetectable HBV DNA rate was significantly correlated to baseline HBV DNA load (P＜ 0. 05). The <b>HBeAg</b> clearance rate was significantly correlated to baseline <b>HBeAg</b> titers and HBV DNA load (P＜ 0. 05). The <b>HBeAg</b> seroconversion rate was significantly correlated to baseline ALT, <b>HBeAg</b> titers, and HBV DNA load (P＜ 0. 05).

Liver-related death occurred in 11 (15. 7 %) patients, caused by hepatocellular carcinoma in five and liver failure in six. The 25 -year survival probability was 40 % in patients persistently <b>HBeAg</b> positive, 50 % in patients with <b>HBeAg</b> negative CH or <b>HBeAg</b> reversion and 95 % in inactive carriers. Older age, male sex, cirrhosis at entry and absence of sustained remission predicted liver-related death independently.

Positive <b>HBeAg</b> and negative anti-HBe status was found in 11 (42 %) patients. Negative <b>HBeAg</b> and positive anti-HBe was found in 26 (59. 1 %) patients. Both <b>HBeAg</b> and anti-HBe were negative in 7 (16. 3 %) patients. HBV-DNA was detected in all 11 (100 %) patients with positive <b>HBeAg</b> and negative anti-HBe. HBV-DNA was also detected in 11 (42 %) patients with negative <b>HBeAg</b> and positive anti-HBe. However, {{there was only one}} patient (14. 3 %) with both negative <b>HBeAg</b> and anti-HBe status, who had detectable HBV-DNA. Conclusion: Positive <b>HBeAg</b> can be used as an indicator of viremia, but negative <b>HBeAg</b> cannot be used as an indicator of the absence of viremia without further HBV-DNA testing. Patients with negative <b>HBeAg</b> and positive HBV-DNA were suspected for having pre-core mutant...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case {{series of three}} <b>HBeAg</b> {{positive}} and five <b>HBeAg</b> negative patients (7 males, mean age 50. 6 +/- 14. 6 years) with chronic HBV infection experiencing sero-conversion after treatment with entecavir (0. 5 mg/day or 1 mg/day), initiated in 2007. Overall, the mean time to HBsAg clearance was 9. 4 +/- 4. 5 months. Seroconversion occurred in all patients, after a mean time of 8. 0 +/- 3. 7 months. In <b>HBeAg</b> negative patients, mean time to HBsAg clearance and to seroconversion were 9. 2 +/- 5. 9 and 6. 8 +/- 4. 0 months, respectively. In <b>HBeAg</b> positive patients, mean time to HBsAg clearance and to seroconversion were 9. 7 +/- 0. 6 months and 10. 0 +/- 2. 6 months, respectively. In this case series, seroconversion was maintained and was observed both in <b>HBeAg</b> positive patients and in <b>HBeAg</b> negative patients. Therefore, it may be preliminarily suggested that treatment with entecavir could be associated to HBsAg seroconversion {{in a short period}} of time, in both <b>HBeAg</b> positive and <b>HBeAg</b> negative HBV patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a {{potentially}} life-threatening liver infection which may progress to liver failure and cirrhosis. Intrahepatic expression patterns of viral antigens detected by immunohistochemistry may have prognostic implications in disease process. Aim: In this study, we aimed {{to investigate the}} relationship between the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) expression and histological activity index (HAI), fibrosis, serum hepatitis B e-antigen (<b>HBeAg)</b> status and HBV DNA levels in patients with chronic HBV infection. Materials and Methods: A total of 114 liver biopsies from patients with chronic HBV infection were included in the study. Immunohistochemical expression of HBcAg and its relation with HAI, fibrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, <b>HBeAg</b> status and HBV DNA levels were assessed. Results: The presence of nuclear expression of HBcAg did not show any correlations with ALT levels, HAI and fibrosis score. When the groups were categorized according to the <b>HBeAg</b> status, nuclear HBcAg expression was found to be high in <b>HBeAg</b> positive patients. However, HBcAg nuclear expression showed significant correlations with HBV DNA levels and fibrosis scores in <b>HBeAg</b> negative but not <b>HBeAg</b> positive patients. HBV DNA levels were also significantly associated with HAI and fibrosis scores in <b>HBeAg</b> negative patients. Conclusions: Significant differences found between <b>HBeAg</b> positive and negative patients suggest that <b>HBeAg</b> negative disease is different from <b>HBeAg</b> positive disease, and also point outs that in <b>HBeAg</b> negative disease, patients with nuclear HBcAg expression and increased levels of HBV DNA levels are at a higher risk of developing progressive liver disease...|$|E
