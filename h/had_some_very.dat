25|$|Born in London, Anthony {{attended}} Harrow School {{as a free}} day pupil {{for three}} years {{from the age of}} seven because his father's farm, acquired for that reason, lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school at Sunbury, he followed his father and two older brothers to Winchester College, where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> miserable experiences at these two public schools. They ranked as two of the most élite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and was bullied a great deal. At the age of twelve, he fantasised about suicide. However, he also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} cinema in Pakistan began in 1929, when Abdur Rashid Kardar {{set up a}} studio and {{production}} company {{under the name of}} United Players Corporation (later renamed Playart Phototone), which would become the foundation stone for the Lahore film industry. After scouting for locations, he settled for their offices to be established at Ravi Road. The dim-lit area presented with much difficulties and shootings were only possible in the day-light, but nevertheless the area <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> important landmarks like the Ravi Forest and the tombs of Mughal emperor Jahangir and his wife Noor Jahan. It is reported that the team working at the studios would commute on tangas and even lost equipment once while traveling on the bumpy roads on the horse-drawn carriage. However basic and crude their working conditions, Kardar believed in his work and in 1930 he produced the first silent film in Lahore Husn Ka Daku (Mysterious Eagle), under his studio's banner. The film had mild success at cinemas, but prominently established Lahore as a functioning film industry. Kardar vowed on not acting in any other film and instead focusing on direction. Immediately afterwards, the studio released the film Sarfarosh (Brave Heart) in 1931, with Gul Hamid playing the lead role with {{more or less the same}} cast as in the previous film. This production proved equally appealing, but was able to stir noise about the Lahore film industry. Roop Lal Shori, who was a resident of Brandreth Road in Lahore, upon hearing of Lahore's growing film industry, returned to his hometown and produced Qismat Ke Haer Pher (Life After Death) in 1932, which would firmly ground the film industry in Lahore. In 1946, Sajjad Gul set up Evernew Studios in on Multan Road. The following year, Eveready Pictures was established by J.C. Anand, which would go on to become the largest film production and distribution company in Pakistan.|$|E

[...] "His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued.

500|$|At {{comprehensive}} school, Turunen {{performed as}} a singer for several projects.

I think she sang in every school function there was." [...] Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, [...] "If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times". At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert {{in front of a}} thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.|$|E
500|$|Following their meeting, Disney's New York {{representative}} {{ran into}} Stokowski {{on a train}} headed for the East Coast. In writing to Disney, he reported that Stokowski was [...] "really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing. He <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium". In his excited response dated October 26, 1937, Disney wrote that he felt [...] "all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us... The union of Stokowski and his music, together {{with the best of}} our medium, would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation." [...] He had already begun working on a story outline, and wished to use [...] "the finest men... from color... down to animators" [...] on the short. The Sorcerer's Apprentice was to be promoted as a [...] "special" [...] and rented to theatres as a unique film, outside of the Mickey Mouse cartoon series.|$|E
500|$|What the {{technology}} and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions. Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that [...] "at a conservative estimate" [...] the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently, and <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> complex floor traps for [...] "transformations" [...] {{such as that of}} Proteus. The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle's Empress of Morocco (1673) (see detail, top right) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets. Pepys' mentions of stage effects in his diary, 1660–68, give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s, and even more in entering into their enthusiasms, but the 1660s were still early days. There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s–90s, although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better-documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre.|$|E

500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, {{so that when he}} changed into his football boots, his feet felt light, giving himself the impression that he could run faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E

There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all I know now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Precipitated by an {{unhealthy}} weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, {{and a recent}} relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{emphasis}} on horror was praised. Jim Sterling of Destructoid wrote that ZombiU zombies were intimidating {{by comparison with}} other zombie games. Sterling called it an [...] "oppressive" [...] experience, since players were diverted by the GamePad while the game continued in real time. This was echoed by Rich Stanton of Eurogamer, who thought that the system made the game experience scarier. According to Stanton, {{it was one of}} the few zombie titles which lived up to the phrase [...] "survival horror". Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar agreed, saying that ZombiU [...] " [...] in on the 'survival' part of the 'survival horror' genre better than any release in recent memory". Patrick Klepek of Giant Bomb wrote that the game <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>very</b> scary moments, which players who liked survival horror would enjoy. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq praised its atmosphere, which he compared favourably with [...] Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com agreed, calling its atmosphere [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "rich". However, Schilling found the later stages of the game disappointing as the game become less frightening with the introduction of more-powerful weapons.|$|E
