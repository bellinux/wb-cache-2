5|$|State Route 70 (SR 70) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. Connecting Sacramento with U.S. Route 395 (US 395) near Beckwourth Pass (lowest in the Sierra Nevada) via the <b>Feather</b> River Canyon. Through the <b>Feather</b> River Canyon, from SR 149 to US 395, SR 70 is the <b>Feather</b> River Scenic Byway, a Forest Service Byway that {{parallels}} the ex-Western Pacific Railroad's <b>Feather</b> River Route.|$|E
5|$|Tail {{feathers}} of the extinct huia are very rare {{and they have}} become a collectors' item. In June 2010 a single huia tail <b>feather</b> sold at auction in Auckland for NZ$8,000, {{much higher than the}} $500 the auctioneers had expected, making it the most expensive <b>feather</b> ever. The previous record price for a single <b>feather</b> was $US2,800 (NZ$4,000) achieved by a bald eagle <b>feather</b> at auction in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a <b>feather</b> and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the <b>feather</b> and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the <b>feather</b> with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic <b>feather</b> let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5000|$|Black ostrich <b>feathers</b> {{come from}} the male ostrich and are very soft with <b>feathers</b> that are more [...] "stringy" [...] in nature. Gray ostrich <b>feathers</b> are more stark than the black <b>feathers</b> and are often sold at grocery stores. Floss ostrich <b>feathers</b> are the most soft and {{delicate}} <b>feathers</b> and come from underneath the bird's wings. Floss ostrich <b>feathers</b> are more expensive. Chick <b>feathers</b> are more pointed and stark than ostrich <b>feathers,</b> are usually sold at very low prices.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>feathers</b> {{preserved}} in the two immature Yixian specimens of Similicaudipteryx appeared to Xu and colleagues, who described the two <b>feathered</b> specimens, to change with age. The youngest specimen had relatively short primary <b>feathers</b> (those anchored to the hand) compared to its tail <b>feathers.</b> In the older specimen, the primary <b>feathers</b> were the same length as the tail <b>feathers,</b> and secondary <b>feathers</b> (those anchored to the lower arm) were also present. The primary <b>feathers</b> may have grown more slowly than the tail <b>feathers,</b> not reaching equal size until the animal was close to maturity, and the secondary <b>feathers</b> would not appear at all until this more mature stage. This suggests that the wing <b>feathers</b> had little use at a young age, only becoming fully developed with maturity.|$|R
5000|$|Most Lohmann browns have a caramel/brown {{shade of}} <b>feathers,</b> with white <b>feathers</b> {{in a pattern}} round their necks, and white <b>feathers</b> at the tips of their tail <b>feathers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Recent {{studies of}} flight <b>feather</b> barb {{geometry}} reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the <b>feather,</b> whereas Archaeopteryx lacks this large barb angle, indicating potentially weak flight abilities.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can also}} carry mites, but {{a study of}} the <b>feather</b> mite Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. It is possible that the <b>feather</b> mites enhance <b>feather</b> cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other <b>feather</b> care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).|$|E

5000|$|Peacock <b>feathers</b> (...) {{were usually}} worn by {{imperial}} princes, prince consorts, imperial bodyguards and some high-ranking officials. Exceptionally, peacock <b>feathers</b> may be granted {{as a special}} honour.

50|$|Display <b>feathers</b> {{are also}} known from dinosaurs {{that are very}} {{primitive}} members of the bird lineage, or Avialae. The most primitive example is Epidexipteryx, which had a short tail with extremely long, ribbon-like <b>feathers.</b> Oddly enough, the fossil does not preserve wing <b>feathers,</b> suggesting that Epidexipteryx was either secondarily flightless, or that display <b>feathers</b> evolved before flight <b>feathers</b> in the bird lineage. Plumaceous <b>feathers</b> are found in nearly all lineages of Theropoda common in the northern hemisphere, and pennaceous <b>feathers</b> are attested as far down the tree as the Ornithomimosauria. The fact that only adult Ornithomimus had wing-like structures suggests that pennaceous <b>feathers</b> evolved for mating displays.|$|R
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork <b>Feather</b> River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the <b>Feather</b> River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork <b>Feather</b> River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the <b>feather,</b> the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It certainly is a flight <b>feather</b> of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this <b>feather</b> is known so far. As the <b>feather</b> had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E
5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and <b>feather</b> disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes <b>feather</b> loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E
40|$|Many {{bird species}} {{are able to}} replace accidentally lost <b>feathers</b> out of the normal {{moulting}} periods, but whether such replaced <b>feathers</b> are able to restore the original mechanical properties of the plumage has not been evaluated before. In this study we analysed the structure and mechanical behaviour of the original and replaced <b>feathers</b> of 12 blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla. Replaced <b>feathers</b> showed wider rachis and greater density of barbs, but were lighter, shorter and less stiff than original <b>feathers.</b> These results suggest that replaced <b>feathers</b> {{are not able to}} fully restore the original functionality of <b>feathers.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The adult {{specimen}} of Epidexipteryx lacked preserved <b>feathers</b> around the forelimbs, but preserved simple <b>feathers</b> {{on the body}} and long, ribbon-like <b>feathers</b> on the tail. The tail <b>feathers,</b> likely used in display, consisted of a central shaft (rachis) and unbranched vane (unlike the vanes of modern <b>feathers,</b> which are broken up into smaller filaments or barbs).|$|R

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes <b>feather</b> material. A number of <b>feather</b> mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on <b>feather</b> oil.|$|E
5|$|When it was {{originally}} built, the <b>Feather</b> River Highway northeast from Oroville followed the present Oroville Dam Boulevard (County Route B2) to the present location of the Oroville Dam, and then ran north and northeast alongside the North Fork <b>Feather</b> River along a route now covered by Lake Oroville. It left to the north on Dark Canyon Road, meeting the present alignment at Jarbo Gap. Since the old road would be flooded, a $14.8 million new alignment, much of it four lanes, was built around the west side; the Western Pacific Railroad was also relocated to a nearby alignment. The double-decker West Branch Bridge over the West Branch <b>Feather</b> River northwest of the dam, carrying the highway above the rail line, was dedicated on August 15, 1962. Three portions of SR 70 have been upgraded to freeways: north of SR 99 to Berry and Kempton Roads in the early 2010s; south from Marysville to the State Route 65 split in the mid-1950s, extended farther south in the late 1960s and late 2000s; and around downtown Oroville, built in the early 1960s. In 2004, SR 70 was upgraded to a four-lane expressway between <b>Feather</b> River Boulevard north of the Bear River and the Yuba/Sutter county line to the freeway portion south of McGowan Parkway. A freeway interchange was constructed in 2008 at Plumas Lake Boulevard {{for access to the}} Plumas Lake development previously served at an uncontrolled intersection with Plumas Arboga Road. The removal of this intersection effectively upgraded the expressway portion to freeway south to the <b>Feather</b> River Boulevard intersection. In the early 2010s, the last two-lane segment of SR 70 south of Marysville was expanded to a four-lane expressway, with a freeway section bypassing the small town of East Nicolaus to the west. In 2015, the interchange with <b>Feather</b> River Boulevard in Plumas Lake was opened to traffic, eliminating the last signalized intersection between Sacramento (with SR 99) and Marysville.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the {{youngest}} specimen's vaned <b>feathers</b> appeared to lack barbs {{except at the}} tip, instead consisting of a solid sheet. Xu and colleagues interpreted the stark differences in the <b>feathers</b> of the two specimens as primarily age-related.

As the animal aged, the down would be replaced by vaned pennaceous <b>feathers</b> on the hands and tail, but ribbon-like and primitive in form, similar to the tail <b>feathers</b> of Confuciusornis, Epidexipteryx, and some enantiornithines.
