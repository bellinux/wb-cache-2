50|$|The Hypervenom Phantom II is a mid-cut boot {{due to the}} Nike Dynamic <b>Fit</b> <b>Collar</b> {{which is}} made out of Flyknit said to provide ankle support. As before, it has an ACC upper. It also {{features}} a different NikeSkin upper from the previous version. One of the difference was the use of Nike's Flywire technology to provide a lock-in and tightened feel for a cleaner strike.|$|E
40|$|Atrophy of the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles {{is quite}} common in the equine, {{especially}} of the draft breeds. This condition is {{commonly referred to as}} sweeney. In most cases the atrophy is due to pressure on the suprascapular nerve at the point where it crosses the neck of the scapula. A common cause of this pressure is an improperly <b>fitted</b> <b>collar.</b> Another common cause is working a green colt on a heavy load until he becomes tired and in resting himself he pulls sideways...|$|R

40|$|Apodemus flavicollis is {{the most}} {{abundant}} rodent species in the beech woodlands of eastern Italian Alps. We analyzed two-years of radio-tracking data collected from adult individuals during the breeding season to investigate the sexual differences {{in the use of}} space and nesting behaviour, thus deriving information on the mating system. The field trial was based on CMR and radio-tracking (homing-in) techniques. We <b>fitted</b> <b>collars</b> to 64 adult resident mice. From July to October of both 2005 and 2006, we completed 4 radio-tracking sessions of 3 weeks. Fixes were recorded from dusk to dawn; additional daylight fixes allowed to localise burrows.

40|$|The yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis is {{the most}} {{abundant}} rodent species in woodland of eastern Italian Alps and a relevant reservoir of zoonotic pathogens. We analyzed radio-tracking data collected from adult individuals during the breeding season in a year of high population density and low seed production to determine sexual differences on use of space, nesting behaviour and dispersal. The field trial was based on CMR and radio-tracking (homing-in) techniques. We <b>fitted</b> <b>collars</b> to 20 male and 12 female adult resident individuals. From July to October 2005, we completed 4 radio-tracking sessions of 3 weeks. Fixes were recorded from dusk to dawn; additional daylight fixes allowed to localise burrows. The mean number of nocturnal fixes/ animal/session was 65. 7 ± 2. 2 and 12. 4 ± 0. 8 for diurnal fixes. We calculated home ranges as MCP 100...|$|R

50|$|Some {{variations}} of the keyhole were blouses or dresses that had two or three buttons in back. Others had a <b>fitted</b> mockneck <b>collar,</b> accompanied by either a single button or buttons covering {{up to the top}} half of the blouse. Some blouses were made with a full length of buttons, but with a roomy fit, allowing them to be donned and removed with just a single button open.|$|R
50|$|A {{martingale}} collar is {{made with}} two loops. The larger loop is slipped onto the dogs neck and a lead is then clipped to the smaller loop. When the dog tries to pull, the tension on the lead pulls the small loop taut, which makes the large loop smaller and tighter on the neck, thus preventing escape. Properly <b>fitted,</b> the <b>collar</b> will be comfortably loose whenever the dog is not pulling against the leash.|$|R
50|$|Names for {{specific}} styles of collars {{vary with the}} vagaries of fashion. In the 1930s and 1940s, especially, historical styles were adapted by fashion designers; thus, the Victorian bertha collar — a cape-like <b>collar</b> <b>fitted</b> to a low scooping neckline — was adapted in the 1940s but generally attached to a V-neckline.|$|R
50|$|A wolf collar is a <b>collar</b> <b>fitted</b> {{with long}} spikes, which are {{considered}} decorative. Such collars were originally {{used to protect}} dogs from wolves, but wolf collars have now been adopted by the BDSM community. However, the spikes {{are considered to be}} dangerous, and therefore such collars are used with care. Some wolf collars have the spikes coated in plastic for added protection.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{red deer}} hinds were {{captured}} in the Nature Reserve of Acquerino-Cantagallo in the Apennine mountains and <b>fitted</b> with GPS/GSM <b>collars</b> to monitor spatial movement and habitat use.

If casing strings are cemented off-center, there is a high risk that a channel of drilling fluid or contaminated cement will be left where the casing contacts the formation, creating an imperfect seal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal <b>collar</b> <b>fitted</b> to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock shrouds is {{attached}}. Before this the futtock shrouds were attached to the lower shrouds that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower shrouds must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard shrouds.|$|R

50|$|A {{research}} project involves fitting cougars, the top predator in the park, with GPS radio collars and tracking their movements. Simultaneously vicuñas, {{one of their}} main prey animals, are being <b>fitted</b> with <b>collars</b> to monitor their behaviour. It {{has been found that}} in areas of the park with plenty of cover, such as canyons and wetlands, the vicuñas are much more alert to danger and consequently spend less time feeding than they do on open plains. This alters the composition of the plant species present with a resulting increase in invertebrates and in biodiversity. There are plans to fit some condors with collars to find out to what extent they benefit from an increase in the frequency of vicuña kills.|$|R
50|$|Akane is {{received}} at the SEAUn airport {{by a military}} procession {{under the supervision of}} Colonel Nicholas Wong. En route to the coastal city of Shambala Float, where the Sibyl System is being put into effect, Wong explains to her that Dominators are not used in the country, and {{due to a lack of}} resources, latent criminals are instead <b>fitted</b> with <b>collars</b> that will deliver a lethal dose of poison if their Crime Coefficients elevate. Akane is then introduced to Chairman Han, SEAUn's leader. She is warned not to travel outside of Shambala Float, as she cannot be protected by the Sibyl System from the terrorists outside its walls. Akane spends a day in Shambala Float and observes the way its Sibyl System operates.|$|R
5000|$|Qiana is a silky {{nylon fiber}} {{developed}} in 1962 at the DuPont Experimental Station by Stanley Brooke Speck. The fiber was named Qiana when introduced by DuPont in 1968. [...] Initially intended for high-end fashions, {{it became a}} popular material in the 1970s for faux-silk men's shirts, displaying bold patterns. The shirts were generally cut tight and included wide <b>collars</b> to <b>fit</b> over the <b>collars</b> of the double-knit suit coats which were worn popularly to discos.|$|R

50|$|While at the center, {{contact with}} humans is {{deliberately}} minimized {{so that the}} elephants will not acclimate to humans. Elephant calves are looked after until they are 5 years old, when they are released into the wild. The elephants are <b>fitted</b> with radio <b>collars</b> to help wildlife officials monitor their movements, behavior and progress. To erase any residual human smell and help ensure their acceptance among their wild cousins, the elephants are given a bath in diluted elephant dung before being released.|$|R
50|$|Stud collars, {{also called}} wolf collars, {{protection}} collars, or spiked collars {{depending on the}} attachments, are <b>collars</b> <b>fitted</b> with metal studs, dulled points, or sharp points that traditionally prevented another animal from biting the dog's neck. Commonly, spikes are hand-set and tightly riveted for extra security. This type of collar dates back to ancient Greece, when dogs protecting livestock were given nail-studded collars {{to protect them from}} wolves or other predators. In modern societies, stud collars are more commonly considered a fashion accessory.|$|R

50|$|Several {{types of}} pet doors that allow {{selective}} access are available. The advantages {{of this type}} of pet door over simpler models are improved weather resistance, and home security against strays and other unwanted animals. Some use a permanent magnet mounted on the pet's collar to activate a matching electromagnetic mechanism that unlatches the door panel when the magnet comes within range; several pets can be <b>fitted</b> with <b>collars</b> that match the same door. Pet doors with infrared locks open only when a collar-mounted device transmits the correct code to the latch's receiver, allowing owners to have multiple flaps that different pets can use, e.g. a small cat flap to the back yard and a large dog door accessing a dog run. Either type can be used to selectively allow one pet outside access, while denying it to another (e.g., an ill animal that needs to stay indoors).|$|R
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical <b>fit</b> abutments, the <b>collar</b> of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment {{and a better}} seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|R

40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{studying}} the diet of the brown hyaena are discussed. A combination of direct observations (of individuals <b>Fitted</b> with radio <b>collars</b> and beta lights) and faecal analysis yielded the best information. Analysis of food items found at dens was also useful, but tracking spoor had severe limitations. The brown hyaena in the southern Kalahari is predominantly a scavenger {{of all kinds of}} vertebrate remains, supplementing its diet with insects, wild fruits, birds' eggs and the occasional small animal which it kills. It is thus well adapted to the harsh conditions of this arid region where large ungulates are thinly distributed. </p...|$|R
