5|$|The content {{ranges from}} {{extremely}} difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered {{at school and}} often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> generating capacity {{would need to be}} built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
60|$|Thence the old {{man went}} out into the village, and his first halt was at the forge, where Blane, who had grown a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> stouter and <b>more</b> grizzled, started at sight of his square cap.|$|R

But, sah, dey say now Neb has save 'e young masser's life, young masser must gib him free-paper; and no gal of mine shall ebber be free nigger's wife.

6000|$|... "The fifth is," [...] I went on, [...] "that such an {{expedition}} to succeed would need a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of money, <b>more</b> than you or I could find. Partners would be wanted, active or sleeping, but partners with cash." ...|$|R
5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean {{that there was a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that it is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E
5|$|The most {{abundant}} iron isotope 56Fe {{is of particular}} interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the {{most abundant}} element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight. Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, {{a few blocks from}} where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E
6000|$|... "I? But {{what have}} I done?" [...] Rentoul demanded, {{wringing}} his hands. [...] "I have always obeyed orders. Even a hint has been enough. I {{have spent a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of money--much <b>more</b> than I could afford. What have I done wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{may be a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> to you, <b>more</b> {{than you}} think,' said Venetia. 'A <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> awaits you yet. However, {{there can be no}} doubt you should take your seat. You can always return, if you wish. But take your seat, and {{cultivate}} dear Masham. I have the utmost confidence in his wisdom and goodness. You cannot have a friend more respectable. Now mind my advice, George.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most salient}} {{deformation}} theory in mathematics {{has been that}} of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of Kunihiko Kodaira and D. C. Spencer, after deformation techniques had received a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of <b>more</b> tentative application in the Italian school of algebraic geometry. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the Zariski tangent space with a moduli space. The phenomena {{turn out to be}} rather subtle, though, in the general case.|$|R
25|$|Phenylketonuria affects {{about one}} in 12,000 babies. Males and females are {{affected}} equally. The disease was discovered in 1934 by Ivar Asbjørn Følling with the importance of diet determined in 1953. Gene therapy, while promising, requires a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> study as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|Often the {{arrangement}} was made more complex by {{the complexity of}} the piers themselves, so that it was not piers and columns that alternated, but rather, piers of entirely different form from each other, such as those of Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, where the nature of the vault dictated that the alternate piers bore a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> weight than the intermediate ones and are thus very much larger.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year saw the provincial Liberals come {{very close to}} extinction. The party's political credibility had been steadily eroding, and with the negotiations with Social Credit, it was not immediately clear that it had any ideological purpose. There was much discussion of the party abandoning provincial politics altogether (there was only one organization at federal and provincial levels), and concentrating on federal politics, which looked a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> hopeful at the time than they did two years later.|$|E
50|$|Mukhtar {{later became}} friends with the son of Abai Turagulom and married Camille, grand{{daughter}} of the great poet, that {{is the daughter of}} Magauov.Auezov met Dilda, the first wife of Abai with whom he received a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of information. <b>More</b> information about Abai was forthcoming from Eigerim another of Abai’s life partners who survived her husband for more than a decade.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{that these}} publicans were Jews, what follows but that for this {{they were a}} <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> the <b>more</b> abominated by their brethren; and (as I have also hinted before) it is no marvel that they were; for a treacherous brother is worse than an open enemy, Psalm lv. 12, 13; for, if to be debauched in an open and common {{transgression}} is odious, how odious is it for a brother to be so; for a brother in nature and religion to be so. I say again, all this they did, as both John insinuates, and Zaccheus confesses.|$|R
50|$|The West's high {{population}} and economic dominance lend it great political importance. However, Cameroon's government and state-run media, largely run by President Paul Biya's numerically inferior Beti-Pahuin tribal group, are often accused of anti-Bamileke bias. The Bamileke thus {{stand to gain}} a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> from a <b>more</b> free and transparent government, and the West harbors many sympathisers for the presidential party's main opponents, the Social Democratic Front.|$|R
25|$|The game {{started with}} both teams exchanging chances. Argentina began to dominate, however, with England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton saving {{a number of}} good chances, many created by Maradona. Peter Beardsley had England's best chance after 13 minutes, {{following}} a slip from Nery Pumpido in Argentina's goal, but failed to take it. At half time, the score was 00, Argentina having had much more of the possession and territory – and done a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> of the running – but having failed to get through England's resolute defence.|$|E
25|$|Baum's avowed {{intentions}} {{with the}} Oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as {{are found in}} the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. The first books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased with the series; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objected to doing violence even to the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> than eliminate harsh moral lessons.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and {{to get rid of}} his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 Kronen a year, but by 1919 was worth a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more,</b> with a sizable portfolio of investments in the United States and the Netherlands. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.|$|E
60|$|The Wellington {{representative}} was a plucky boxer, {{but he was}} not in {{the same}} class as Tony. After a few exchanges, the latter got to work, and after that there was only one man in the ring. In the middle of the second round the referee stopped the fight, and gave it to Tony, who came away as fresh as he had started, and a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> happier and <b>more</b> confident.|$|R
5000|$|Several of Crowe's {{pieces are}} internet-based. SERVICE 2000, for example, was {{a ring of}} spoof {{websites}} for notable art galleries. Other work, like [...] "Discrete Packets" [...] and [...] "Police Radio" [...] use the web as a medium for exploring wider cultural concerns. Crowe also works a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> in <b>more</b> traditional art media including film and photography as well as installation and publishing. He also produces engraved glass works which deal with subjects as wide as internet memorial web pages and the occupation of Iraq. Some film and video work, uploaded to YouTube has engaged with the pitfalls and possibilities of the online participatory culture with increasingly subtle use of displacement and irony.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{a little}} sleep does refresh one!" [...] {{she said to}} herself, as she was bustling about. She was a woman of very {{vigorous}} constitution, and at seventy had been a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> stronger and <b>more</b> active than her son was at that age. The moment Old Pipes saw his mother, {{he knew that the}} Dryad had been there; but, while he felt as happy as a king, he was too wise to say anything about her.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about amusia. However, there remains a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if {{this would be a}} viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development. Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{is visible}} to the naked eye as a slow-moving, bright white dot because of {{reflected}} sunlight, and can be seen in the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit but the ground and sky are dark. The ISS takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another, and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the Earth's shadow. Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky, excluding flares, with an approximate maximum magnitude of −4 when overhead (similar to Venus). The ISS, like many satellites including the Iridium constellation, can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of Venus as sunlight glints off reflective surfaces. The ISS is also visible during broad daylight conditions, albeit with a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> effort.|$|E
60|$|Miss Hacket {{said she}} had been just feeding them when the G.F.S. girl arrived, and as Mysie came to a halt in delight at the aspect of a young one that had just crept out into public life, the sister was called to the window. She was a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> younger and <b>more</b> of the present day in style than her sister, and had pensive-looking grey eyes, with a {{somewhat}} bored languid manner as she shook hands with the early visitors.|$|R
60|$|The {{problem of}} Sir Isaac {{and just what}} he was doing and what he thought he was doing and what he meant to do {{increased}} in importance in Lady Harman's mind as the days passed by. He had an air of being malignantly up to something and she could not imagine what this something could be. He spoke to her very little but he looked at her a <b>great</b> <b>deal.</b> He had <b>more</b> and more of the quality of a premeditated imminent explosion....|$|R
30|$|However, {{the role}} of {{technology}} adoption and adjustment of supply is of central importance with respect to securing adequate levels of agricultural production and achieving global food security. Consequently, recent studies stressed {{the role of}} market transparency and information flows for improving production decisions in agricultural markets (see UNCTAD 2011). Thus, market transparency can {{be understood in terms}} of parameters that, at least partially, are under control of public and private agencies. Governmental and non-governmental organizations then may enhance transparency by providing a <b>greater</b> <b>deal</b> and <b>more</b> reliable information on important determinants of price movements, such as indicators of climate change, international market conditions, government price stabilization schemes, weather forecasts, disaster relief programs, stricter food safety standards, insurance and alternatives (UNCTAD 2011).|$|R
25|$|Pirates had {{a system}} of {{hierarchy}} on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and {{had the power to}} veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, the political party Sinn Féin ("Ourselves") won the majority of votes in the Irish general election, 1918, this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the Sinn Féin campaign Manifesto of 1918, a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> than the devolved government/Home Rule advocated by the (I.P.P)Irish Parliamentary Party. Following the Sinn Féin victory in these elections the Irish Declaration of Independence was penned and Irish republicans launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the Irish War of Independence (January 1919 – July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally {{took the form of}} street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, {{with the exception of the}} south Armagh area, where Frank Aiken led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in County Donegal and the City of Derry, where one of the main Republican leaders was Peadar O'Donnell. Hugh O'Doherty, a Sinn Féin politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the First Dáil, which was elected in late 1918, Prof. Eoin Mac Néill served as the Sinn Féin T.D. for Derry city.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Caesar Jenkyns, {{who signed}} for Woolwich Arsenal {{where he was}} {{appointed}} captain, all the regular first-team players remained with the club. Goalkeeper Joe Fall signed from Newton Heath for a fee reported as £20, and defender Harry Haynes joined from Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Dart thought that Jenkyns would be missed [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> than some of [...] supporters imagine", and that apart from Fall, who {{was expected to be}} [...] "a big improvement" [...] on Partridge, the 1895–96 team would be noticeably weaker than that of the season just ended.|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> (probably <b>more</b> than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|R

"Now," [...] {{continued}} Aileen, [...] "these jewels are, it seems, worth a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of money--much <b>more</b> than I had {{any idea}} of--for there are among them {{a number of very}} fine diamond rings and brooches. In fact, papa told me that he believed the whole were worth between eight and nine thousand pounds. This, you know, is a sum which will at least raise us above want, (poor Miss Pritty, well did she know that!)--though of course it will not enable us to live very luxuriously. How fortunate it was that these pirates--" ...|$|R
