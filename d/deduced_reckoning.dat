It took the 1997 Sojourner Mars rover between 3 and 5 communications cycles to accomplish this on rocks. This paper describes the NASA Ames approach to robustly accomplishing single cycle instrument deployment, using the K 9 prototype Mars rover. An offboard 3 D site model is used to select science targets for the rover.

This is achieved through the development of high integrity map matching algorithms. In the last two decades, satellite navigation technology, especially the Global Positioning System (GPS), has established itself as a major positioning technology for land vehicle navigation. <b>Deduced</b> <b>Reckoning</b> (DR) sensors, which consist of an odometer and a gyroscope, are commonly used to bridge any gaps in GPS positioning. However, DR sensor positioning errors can grow rapidly if not controlled by another sensor or system such as GPS. Digital road maps are used for spatial reference of the vehicle location via a process known as map matching. Map matching algorithms use inputs generated from positioning technologies and supplement this with data from a high resolution digital road network map to provide an enhanced positioning output.

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Geoinformatica [© Springer Verlag]. The {{original}} publication {{is available at}} www. springerlink. comMap matching algorithms are utilised to support the navigation module of advanced transport telematics systems. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a framework to quantify the effects of spatial road network data and navigation sensor data on the performance of map matching algorithms. Three map matching algorithms are tested with different spatial road network data (map scale 1 : 1, 250; 1 : 2, 500 and 1 : 50, 000) and navigation sensor data (global positioning system (GPS) and GPS augmented with <b>deduced</b> <b>reckoning)</b> in order to quantify their performance. The algorithms are applied to different road networks of varying complexity. The performance of the algorithms is then assessed for a suburban road network using high precision positioning data obtained from GPS carrier phase observables. The results show that there are considerable effects of spatial road network data on the performance of map matching algorithms. For an urban road network, the results suggest that both the quality of spatial road network data and the type of navigation system affect the link identification performance of map matching algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Pedestrian {{navigation}} on an iPhone today {{does not}} provide the accuracy to place the pedestrian on the correct side of a street. A deciding issue that prevents sufficient accuracy is the errors that occur when using satellite positioning in urban environments. Another big problem is that heading data has shown {{a tendency to be}} inaccurate. Chapter 2 explains satellites navigation, navigation techniques, and sensors. Chapter 4 describes how a prototype was developed. The prototype uses <b>deduced</b> <b>reckoning</b> and turn detection to navigate a pedestrian road network, without relying on satellite signals. The prototype is intended to run on iPhone 5 and utilizes accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), and gyroscope data together with detailed data about the pedestrian network to accurately track a pedestrian. It features a turn detection method that makes it possible to perform a logical traversal of the road network, together with step detection and step length estimation to move around. The turn detection method was very effective and gave good results when combined with logical traversal. For the two routes that were tested the total error in distance estimation was about 3 ~ 7 % and for both routes a close fit to the actual routes was achieved. For individual parts of the routes the largest distance estimation errors varied between 3 and 15 %...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] algorithms are used to integrate positioning data with digital road network data so that vehicles can be placed on a road map. However, due to error associated with both positioning and map data, there can be a high degree of uncertainty associated with the map-matched locations. A quality indicator representing the level of confidence (integrity) in map-matched locations is essential for some Intelligent Transport System applications and could provide a warning to the user and provide a means of fast recovery from a failure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine an empirical method to derive the integrity of a map-matched location for three previously developed algorithms. This is achieved by formulating a metric based on various error sources associated with the positioning data and the map data. The metric ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates a very high level of uncertainty in the map-matched location and 100 indicates a very low level of uncertainty. The integrity method is then tested for the three map-matching algorithms in the cases when the positioning data is from either a stand-alone global positioning system (GPS) or GPS integrated with <b>deduced</b> <b>reckoning</b> (DR) and for map data from three different scales (1 : 1250, 1 : 2500, and 1 : 50 000). The results suggest that the performance of the integrity method depends on the type of map-matching algorithm and the quality of the digital map data. A valid integrity warning is achieved 98. 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems [© Taylor & Francis]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] research on map matching algorithms for land vehicle navigation has been based on either a conventional topological analysis or a probabilistic approach. The input to these algorithms normally comes from the global positioning system (GPS) and digital map data. Although the performance of some of these algorithms is good in relatively sparse road networks, they are not always reliable for complex roundabouts, merging or diverging sections of motorways, and complex urban road networks. In high road density areas where the average distance between roads is less than 100 m, there may be many road patterns matching the trajectory of the vehicle reported by the positioning system at any given moment. Consequently, {{it may be difficult to}} precisely identify the road on which the vehicle is travelling. Therefore, techniques for dealing with qualitative terms such as likeliness are essential for map matching algorithms to identify a correct link. Fuzzy logic is one technique that is an effective way to deal with qualitative terms, linguistic vagueness, and human intervention. This article develops a map matching algorithm based on fuzzy logic theory. The inputs to the proposed algorithm are from GPS augmented with data from <b>deduced</b> <b>reckoning</b> sensors to provide continuous navigation. The algorithm is tested on different road networks of varying complexity. The validation of this algorithm is carried out using high precision positioning data obtained from GPS carrier phase observables. The performance of the developed map matching algorithm is evaluated against the performance of several well-accepted existing map matching algorithms. The results show that the fuzzy logic-based map matching algorithm provides a significant improvement over existing map matching algorithms both in terms of identifying correct links and estimating the vehicle position on the links...|$|E

Existing map matching algorithms have weaknesses which decrease their capability to support many ATT services. Three high integrity map matching algorithms are developed in {{this research}}. They are the improved topological, probabilistic, and fuzzy logic map matching algorithms. These algorithms are successfully implemented, tested and validated using real field test data. A reference (truth) vehicle trajectory, as determined by high accuracy GPS carrier phase positioning, is used to validate the algorithms. The integrity (level of confidence) of the algorithms is analysed by taking into account the uncertainty associated with the map-matched location and the error sources associated with the navigation system and the digital map. The effects of navigation systems and digital map quality on the performance of map matching algorithms are also investigated for suburban and urban road networks. The results suggest that all three map matching algorithms developed in the course of this research have the potential to support the navigation function of a wide range of ATT services. However, of the three, the fuzzy logic map matching algorithm offers the highest performance, both in terms of link identification and location determination.
