50|$|When an <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signal</b> {{passes through}} a {{communication}} channel, it is progressively degraded due to loss of power. For example, when a telephone call {{passes through a}} wire telephone line, some of the power in the electric current which represents the audio signal is dissipated as heat in {{the resistance of the}} copper wire.

Similarly, the farther from a radio station a receiver is, the weaker the radio signal, and the poorer the reception.

40|$|Radio {{communication}} over interstellar distances is studied, {{accounting for}} noise, dispersion, scattering and motion. Large transmitted powers suggest maximizing power efficiency (ratio of information rate to average signal power) {{as opposed to}} restricting bandwidth. The fundamental limit to reliable communication is determined, and is not affected by carrier frequency, dispersion, scattering, or motion. The available efficiency is limited by noise alone, and the available information rate is limited by noise and available average power. A set of five design principles (well within our own technological capability) can asymptotically approach the fundamental limit; no other civilization can achieve greater efficiency. Bandwidth can be expanded {{in a way that}} avoids invoking impairment by dispersion or scattering. The resulting power-efficient signals have characteristics very different from current SETI targets, with wide bandwidth relative to the information rate and a sparse distribution of energy in both time and frequency. Information-free beacons achieving the lowest average power consistent with a given receiver observation time are studied. They need not have wide bandwidth, but do distribute energy more sparsely in time as average power is reduced. The discovery of both beacons and <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signals</b> is analyzed, and most closely resembles approaches that have been employed in optical SETI. No processing is needed to account for impairments other than noise. A direct statistical tradeoff between a larger number of observations and a lower average power (including due to lower information rate) is established. The "false alarms" in current searches are characteristic signatures of these signals.

Rapid tuning of the microwave/millimeter-wave carrier, the modulation scheme, and the data rate is achievable through this method with no fixed oscillators at the basestation, thus providing for flexible architectures.

A rigorous closed-form expression for the spectral efficiency is derived. The effects of the channel estimation error, the channel estimation overhead, the length of the training duration, and the randomness of the user locations are analyzed.

40|$|In {{physical}} layer security (PHY-security), the frequently observed high {{correlation between the}} main and wiretap channels can cause a significant loss of secrecy. This paper investigates a slow fading scenario, where a transmitter (Alice) sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver (Bob) while a passive eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to decode the message from its received signal. It is assumed that Alice is equipped with multiple antennas while Bob and Eve each have a single antenna (i. e., a MISOSE system). In a MISOSE system, high correlation results in nearly collinear main and wiretap channel vectors, which help Eve to see and intercept confidential information. Unfortunately, the signal processing techniques at Alice, such as beamforming and artificial noise (AN), are helpless, especially in the extreme case of completely collinear main and wiretap channel vectors. On this background, we first investigate the achievable secrecy outage probability via beamforming and AN at Alice with the optimal power allocation between the <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signal</b> and AN. Then, an ingenious model, in which a cooperative jamming relay (Relay) is introduced, is proposed to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high correlation. Based on the proposed model, the power allocation between the <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signal</b> at Alice and the AN at Relay is also studied to maximize secrecy.

40|$|The {{deliberate}} {{addition of}} Gaussian noise to cochlear implant signals {{has previously been}} proposed to enhance the time coding of signals by the cochlear nerve. Potentially, the addition of an inaudible level of noise could also have secondary benefits: it could lower the threshold to the <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signal,</b> and by desynchronization of nerve discharges, it could increase {{the level at which}} the <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signal</b> becomes uncomfortable. Both these effects would lead to an increased dynamic range, which might be expected to enhance speech comprehension and make the choice of cochlear implant compression parameters less critical (as with a wider dynamic range, small changes in the parameters would have less effect on loudness). The hypothesized secondary effects were investigated with eight users of the Clarion cochlear implant; the stimulation was analogue and monopolar. For presentations in noise, noise at 95 % of the threshold level was applied simultaneously and independently to all the electrodes. The noise was found in two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) experiments to decrease the threshold to sinusoidal stimuli (100  Hz, 1  kHz, 5  kHz) by about 2. 0  dB and increase the dynamic range by 0. 7  dB. Furthermore, in 2 AFC loudness balance experiments, noise was found to decrease the loudness of moderate to intense stimuli. This suggests that loudness is partially coded by the degree of phase-locking of cochlear nerve fibers. The overall gain in dynamic range was modest, and more complex noise strategies, for example, using inhibition between the noise sources, may be required to get a clinically useful benefit...|$|E

For the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output interference channel (MIMO-IC) with the interference treated as Gaussian noise, {{we show that}} the user's achievable rate can be expressed as a summation of the rate achievable by the conventional proper or circularly symmetric complex Gaussian signaling {{in terms of the}} users' transmit covariance matrices, and an additional term, which is a function of both the users' transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. The additional degrees of freedom in the pseudo-covariance matrix, which is conventionally set to be zero for the case of proper Gaussian signaling, provide an opportunity to further improve the achievable rates of Gaussian MIMO-ICs by employing improper Gaussian signaling. To this end, this paper proposes widely linear precoding, which efficiently maps proper <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signals</b> to improper transmitted signals at each transmitter for any given pair of transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. In particular, for the case of two-user Gaussian single-input single-output interference channel (SISO-IC), we propose a joint covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization algorithm with improper Gaussian signaling to achieve the Pareto-optimal rates. By utilizing the separable structure of the achievable rate expression, an alternative algorithm with separate covariance and pseudo-covariance optimization is also proposed, which guarantees the rate improvement over conventional proper Gaussian signaling.

30|$|First, {{it has to}} be {{emphasized}} that precise synchronization is of immense significance to the detection of short-duration information waveform as in USCS. Specifically, a practical 1 % timing error with respect to pulse duration may degrade the detection performance by 20 dB (or even much) for impulse UWB [5, 29]. So, it is indeed of promise to integrate a precise synchronization reference in emission signal to reinforce receiver performance (see Section 3.2). A comprehensive energy efficiency analysis in this situation will also be found in Section 4.1. Moreover, other than facilitating accurate timing, this highly strong single-frequency component can be easily extracted from received signals by using a simple PLL, so that the recovered energy can be further collected to compensate energy consumption in receivers [18]. If we assume the emission power in intermittent mode is 0.5 mW, then taking a LDC value of 1 % for example, for continuous USCS the total carrier energy may reach 49.5 mW. Assuming a conservative energy conversion ratio of 70 %, then the receiver can basically collect an additional energy of 3.1 mW from the <b>information-bearing</b> <b>signals,</b> when operating in a typically short-range scene with a propagation attenuation of - 10 dB [11, 28]. This accumulated energy may even entirely cover the energy consumption for a long detection period. Thus, such a carrier-synchronized signal can be fully explored to provide an attractive remote powering approach to large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Notice that, however, energy efficiency of this remote powering solution may be degraded in long-range applications.|$|R
