The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But {{all you have to}} do <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me to know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... And so what I would do <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone." ...|$|E
