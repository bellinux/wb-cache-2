The two filters are exactly matched with the same cut-off frequency and mirror-symmetrical responses. It is therefore ideal for use in diplexers.

If the conductivity of the head tissues is assumed to be real, the pre-conditioned conjugate gradients (PCGs) algorithm can be used to calculate efficiently the approximate forward solution to a given error tolerance. The performance and the regularizing properties of the PCG iteration for solving ill-conditioned systems of equa-tions (PCGNs) is then explored, and a suitable preconditioning ma-trix is suggested in order to enhance its convergence rate. For image reconstruction, the nonlinear inverse problem is considered.

40|$|Abstract: Ambulatory pH {{monitoring}} {{is currently}} the best method for detection of gastro-oesophageal reflux. However, pH electrodes are able to measure only acid reflux, and therefore, non-acid reflux episodes, a potentially important cause of symptoms, are ignored by this technique. Multichannel intraluminal electrical impedance has recently been proposed {{as a novel method}} to overcome the above limitation of pH testing. Impedance (expressed in ohms) {{is a measure of the}} total opposition to current flow between adjacent electrodes. As refluxed contents are characterised by different conductivity, which is the <b>inverse</b> of <b>impedance,</b> for the first time a pH-independent accurate and practical qualitative analysis of refluxate is possible. For instance, the conductivity of air is almost zero and then impedance increases compared with baseline, whereas the conductivity of liquid is much higher and the impedance curve decreases remarkably. The combination of electrical impedance with traditional pH monitoring has the only aim of differentiating acid from non-acid liquid reflux. Moreover, the impedance catheter contains multiple pairs of ring electrodes along the oesophagus, so that an exact assessment of the proximal extent of refluxed material can be achieved. From a clinical point of view, electrical impedance + pH-metry could be useful for identifying the number and percent times of gas, acid and non-acid reflux episodes, to improve the yield of symptom index, to evaluate the reasons for poor response of reflux symptoms to proton pump inhibitors and to know the proximal extent of reflux events in patients with atypical symptoms. Thus, this technique has the potential to become a useful tool for improving our knowledge of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and optimising. the management of these patients...|$|R

During <b>impedance</b> manometry, the <b>inverse</b> of <b>impedance</b> (admittance) can be used to measure bolus presence and infer UES opening. We hypothesized that the temporal relationship between UES relaxation, opening and hyolaryngeal elevation would change with increasing bolus volume. Simultaneous intramuscular cricopharyngeal (CP) electromyography (EMG), surface submental EMG (SM-EMG), and high-resolution impedance manometry were recorded in eight (aged 27 ± 7 years, 5 M) healthy volunteers, while swallowing 0. 9 % saline boluses of 2, 5, 10, and 20 ml. Data were exported and analyzed via Matlab. Statistical analysis comprised repeated measures one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation. A P value of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Duration of CP deactivation increased at 20 ml volume (P < 0. 001). UES relaxation and opening increased with increasing bolus volume (P < 0. 001); however, overall duration of SM activation did not change. As UES opening occurs progressively earlier with increasing volumes, peak SM-EMG activity occurs relatively later (P < 0. 001) and shifts from occurring before to following peak UES distention. During healthy swallowing, there is sensory modulation of cricopharyngeal and submental muscle activity. Intrabolus pressures, transmitted from the tongue base and pharynx, play a progressively more important role in sphincter opening with increasing volume. The findings may explain why some healthy elderly and patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia have difficulty swallowing larger while tolerating smaller bolus volumes...|$|R

In the traditional EMI method, the PZT electro-mechanical (EM) admittance (<b>inverse</b> of the <b>impedance)</b> is used as damage indicator, which is difficult to specify the effect of damage on structural properties. This paper uses the structural mechanical impedance (SMI) extracted from the PZT EM admittance signature as the damage indicator.
