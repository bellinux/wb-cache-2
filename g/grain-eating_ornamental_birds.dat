50|$|The decimal one penny (1p) (pingin) coin was {{the second}} {{smallest}} denomination of the Irish pound.

50|$|Black swans were {{introduced}} to various countries as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>bird</b> in the 1800s, but have escaped and formed stable populations. A small population of black swans exists on the River Thames at Marlow, and near the River Itchen, Hampshire, there is also one on the River Tees near Stockton on Tees. Described scientifically by English naturalist John Latham in 1790, the black swan was formerly placed into a monotypic genus, Chenopis. Black swans can be found singly, or in loose companies numbering into the hundreds or even thousands. Black swans are popular birds in zoological gardens and bird collections, and escapees are sometimes seen outside their natural range.|$|R

50|$|This species breeds {{widely in}} Africa except in deserts and dense forests, and is locally abundant. They are found {{mostly in the}} Nile Valley {{and south of the}} Sahara.

It has also been introduced elsewhere: Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany have self-sustaining populations which are mostly derived from escaped <b>ornamental</b> <b>birds.</b> Escapes have also bred on occasion in other places, such as Texas, Florida and New Zealand. The British population dates back to the 18th century, though only formally added to the British list in 1971. In Britain, it is found mainly in East Anglia, in parkland with lakes.

50|$|Some sources {{suggest the}} bowl was {{imported}} across the Irish Sea because {{the practice of}} producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique {{was done in the}} Belgae workshops of south-east England, and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland. However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland. A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National. Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at County Galway. Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard, no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain, so the practice of making bowls with <b>ornamental</b> <b>bird</b> handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early 1st Century AD.|$|R

60|$|The {{bills of}} lading, and some notes and letters which lay upon the desk, sufficed to inform {{me that the}} Brazilian brig Nossa Sehnora da Vittoria had cleared from Bahia a month before.

She was bound for London, and a glance at the bills of lading was {{sufficient}} to show me that we were not likely to profit {{much in the way of}} salvage. Her cargo consisted of nuts, ginger, and wood, the latter in the shape of great logs of valuable tropical growths. It was these, no doubt, which had prevented the ill-fated vessel from going to the bottom, but they were of such a size as to make it impossible for us to extract them. Besides these, there were a few fancy goods, such as a number of <b>ornamental</b> <b>birds</b> for millinery purposes, and a hundred cases of preserved fruits.

50|$|The {{reason for}} its {{disappearance}} was probably habitat destruction. It {{is not known}} why it was always considered rare, but the rarity {{is believed to be}} genuine (and not an artefact of insufficient fieldwork) as its erstwhile habitat was frequently scoured by hunters in Colonial times. The pink-headed duck was much sought after by hunters and later as an <b>ornamental</b> <b>bird,</b> mainly because of its unusual plumage. Like most diving ducks, it was not considered good eating, which should facilitate the survival of any remnant birds. The last specimen was shot in 1935 in Darbhanga, Bihar, India, by C. M. Inglis, who did not even know what he had killed, until his dog, a retriever, brought the bird to him. Some birds were also kept in the aviaries of Jean Théodore Delacour in Clères (France) and Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park (England) where the last known birds lived in captivity. The only known photographs of the species were taken here and include one of a pair taken around 1925 by David Seth-Smith.|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{trade and}} {{emerging}} infectious diseases pose significant threats to {{human and animal}} health and global biodiversity. Legal and illegal trade in domestic and wild birds has {{played a significant role}} in the global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1, which has killed more than 240 people, many millions of poultry, and an unknown number of wild birds and mammals, including endangered species, since 2003. This 2007 study provides evidence for a significant decline in the scale of the wild bird trade in Hanoi since previous surveys in 2000 (39. 7 % decline) and 2003 (74. 1 % decline). We attribute this to the enforcement of Vietnam&# 039;s Law 169 / 2005 /QD UBND, introduced in 2005, which prohibits the movement and sale of wild and <b>ornamental</b> <b>birds</b> in cities. Nevertheless, 91. 3 % (21 / 23) of bird vendors perceived no risk of H 5 N 1 infection from their birds, and the trade continues, albeit at reduced levels, in open market shops. These findings highlight the importance of continued law enforcement to maintain this trade reduction and the associated benefits to human and animal health and biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|Birds {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} and most colourful groups of animals, but they can also be a source of zoonotic factors dangerous for humans. This paper describes the threats to human health from contact with birds. The most vulnerable occupational groups associated with birds are veterinarians, owners of poultry farms, breeders of <b>ornamental</b> <b>birds,</b> zoo personnel, and poultry slaughterhouse workers. Ornithosis is the most dangerous zoonosis of the avian bacterial diseases. Among other hazardous bacterial factors, Salmonella and Campylobacter are responsible for gastrointestinal diseases. Avian influenza is the most dangerous of the viral diseases. It should be noted, however, that avian influenza is a disease of birds, not humans. The recent threat which has appeared is infection with West Nile virus. The results of serological examinations of birds and humans indicate that the virus exists in our ecosystem. Allergic alveolitis connected with the pigeon tick and the Dermanyssus gallinae mite also merits mention. In any case, where people have contact with birds or their droppings and secretions, special precautions should be taken. This way the negative effects of birds on human health can be minimised or eliminate...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{reports on}} a {{serological}} survey for antibodies to influenza type A viruses in dogs living in areas {{at high risk of}} introduction and spread of influenza viruses in North-eastern Italy, where LPAI and HPAI outbreaks have been frequently reported. The serosurvey was aimed to provide further information about the possibility of dogs of being infected and spreading of avian influenza viruses (AIV). In 2008 a total of 59 serum samples were collected from dogs kept as companion animals in 38 poultry farms located in the provinces of Padua and Rovigo (Veneto region). Ten farms had been affected by HPAI H 7 N 1 outbreaks and 4 by LPAI H 7 N 3 in 2000 and 2003, respectively. Furthermore, 7 canine sera were collected in a dealer farm (<b>ornamental</b> <b>birds),</b> where there was an ongoing outbreak of LPAI H 7 N 3 in the birds. Screening of serum samples, using a Mab-based competitive ELISA detecting nucleoprotein A (NPA) of influenza viruses, showed that none was positive to anti-NPA antibodies. This finding seems to support the hypothesis that dogs are at very low risk of AIV infection and that their role into the natural transmission cycle of influenza viruses is very limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of aquatic game {{birds in the}} United States is {{a small but growing}} industry. Approximately 50, 000 wild ducks and 5, 000 wild geese constitute the present annual production. Some of these birds are bred by individual or organized sportsmen for their own use, some by fanciers because of their interest in the birds, and others by breeders for sale. The market for two species, the mallard duck and the Canada goose, demands birds for use in restocking, for decoys, and for food. Sale for food is {{the exception rather than the}} rule, and is to the better class of restaurants, hotels, and clubs, so that good prices are realized. Species other than the mallard and the Canada goose are produced only in small numbers and are sold to propagators and collectors of <b>ornamental</b> <b>birds</b> and to zoological gardens.
