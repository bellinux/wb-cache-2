We determine six archetypes of ESN users, namely, power users, limited users, reluctant users, repudiators, hidden champions, and question marks. From a theoretical viewpoint, this study contributes to the discussion around user typology of ESN users and the utilization intensity, acceptance, and value contribution of ESNs.

Our analysis of the financial benefits of these implementations yields mixed results. In the case of ERP systems, we observe some evidence of improvements in profitability but not in stock returns. The results for improvements in profitability are stronger in the case of early adopters of ERP systems. On average, adopters of SCM system experience positive stock returns as well as improvements in profitability. There is no evidence of improvements in stock returns or profitability for firms that have invested in CRM. Although our results are not uniformly positive across the different enterprise systems (ES), they are encouraging in the sense that despite the high implementation costs, we do not find persistent evidence of negative performance associated with ES investments.

40|$|This article {{illustrates}} how {{to optimize the}} return on investment or ROI of enterprise architecture. Enterprise architecture is a blueprint for defining the structure and operation of organizations, such as local, state, and federal agencies. Done well enterprise architecture results in leaner and more effective information systems that satisfy organizational goals and objectives. This article introduces a suite of simple metrics and models for measuring the ROI of enterprise architecture. This article also introduces real options, which is a contemporary approach to measuring ROI. Whereas, typical measures tend to underestimate ROI, real options {{have the ability to}} unearth business value hidden deep within the economics of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>enterprise</b> architecture. Overview Enterprise architecture is a comprehensive framework or taxonomy of systems analysis models for aligning organizational strategy with information technology. Strategies are plans to satisfy organizational goals and objectives by competing based on size, cost, variety, speed, quality, uniqueness, or innovation. Information technology refers to the computers, software, and networks used for safely storing, processing, retrieving, and transmitting data and information. John A.

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of {{announcements}} of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>enterprise</b> resource planning (ERP) systems has so far yielded divergent results. The present study, using data on ERP system implementation announcements of 112 predominantly Fortune 350 firms during 1990 - 2010, examines the impact of ERP implementation announcements on stock returns in the United States. The empirical result shows that abnormal returns of the US firms for the event window (- 1, + 1) on ERP system implementation announcements are positive and statistically significant. Our empirical results reveal that publicly traded companies in the US generate significant reactions in the positive direction in the stock market. The reason of this positive announcement effect is that the market stays hopeful of larger returns for the years to come with the streamlining of business processes in line with the industry's best practices. The capital market anticipates positive net future cash flows from the use of ERP systems. ERP systems enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the firms through increasing their production flexibility and streamlining critical business processes such as sale and inventory management. Accordingly, stock market participants react positively to the announcements of ERP system implementations as is proven in this study. [...] P. ii.

40|$|<b>Investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Systems (ES) {{represent}} {{a significant part}} of many organisations’ investments. Time and budget overruns have been more a rule than an exception in ES implementations. One critical success factor for improving ES implementation is Enterprise Systems Implementation Methodologies (ESIMs). There is a lack of research on the use of ESIMs; however, the scant research does show contradictory findings regarding the potential of ESIMs and their use in ES implementation contexts. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe and explain the use of ESIMs with emphasis on how they are used by implementers and on the conditions for their use in ES implementation contexts. Informed by research in Information System (IS) development, particularly by Fitzgerald, Russo and Stolterman’s method-in-action framework and underpinned by critical realism, more specifically Margaret Archer’s Realist Social Theory (RST), a realist explanation of the use of ESIMs is advanced. The explanation incorporates the tenets of RST, i. e., analytical dualism, morphogenetic cycle and reflexivity taxonomy and suggests an interpretation of the use of ESIMs as reflexive adaptation strategies. Using this interpretation as a conceptual guide, a longitudinal case study of an ESIM provided by an international ES provider, is carried out. Two qualitative data collection methods, documentation and semi-structured interviews with implementers are used to gather information. Through a qualitative analysis of the case, an evolutionary pattern of four types of use of ESIMs is identified: fragmented, aggregated, integrated and infrastructural. Each type depicts a particular configuration of a reflexive adaptation strategy. By integrating disparate lines of existing research in IS development and ES research, this work offers an alternative way of theoretically framing and interpreting the use of ESIMs. The descriptive and explanatory insights advanced in this study provide a more coherent and context-sensitive account of the use of ESIMs over time. This study facilitates the identification of potential configurations of reflexive adaptation strategies and the anticipation of changes in the use of ESIMs and their potentials...|$|E

40|$|Taking Chinese listed {{companies}} in 2008 – 2015 as the sample, {{in this paper}} we test in detail the impact of female directors on corporate environmental investments. Furthermore, we study the impact of female directors on environmental <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>enterprises</b> with different types of ownership and industry attributes. Empirical studies show that when there are only 1 or 2 female directors on the board, no significant impact on the scale of corporate environmental investment can be seen. However, when the number reaches at least 3, female directors have a significantly positive impact on the scale of corporate environmental investment. This confirms critical-mass theory; meanwhile, we find that the empirical results do not indicate any significant correlation when the variable of female directors is measured by the proportion of female directors and the Blau index of gender balance. Further analysis suggests that <b>in</b> state-owned <b>enterprises</b> and enterprises from heavily-polluting industries, the above findings remain true, while <b>in</b> non-state-owned <b>enterprises</b> and enterprises from non-heavily-polluting industries, the above findings prove false, i. e., that the impact of female directors on corporate environmental investment is not significant.

40|$|Decision {{support and}} {{business}} management systems {{are becoming increasingly}} important for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). There has been very limited research on software-as-a-service-based (SaaS) systems for SMEs and the subsequent benefits of these. This study aims to {{gain an understanding of}} the benefits that may be achieved with SaaS-based integrated enterprise systems (IES). It was ascertained that IT-structure and organisational benefits may be achieved through implementing an SaaS-based IES for SMEs. Moreover, SME characteristics, critical success factors, consultant experience and risk factors appear to have an influence on the achievement of benefits. It may be determined that the benefits associated with SaaS-based IES differ from those of traditional ES and thus have to be considered independently from their on-premise counterparts. The study, conducted using mixed methods research (exploratory interviews and questionnaires), ascertained that the investigated system did not perform as expected. One of the most significant results of my research was the finding that SMEs who implemented the full range of functionalities perceived less benefits than those who only implemented parts of the functionalities. This supports the hypothesis that ES projects are not only in large enterprises, but still for SMEs complex change projects. Change takes time and thus it may not be advisable to implement a whole enterprise system within a short period of time. This study contributes to knowledge in the information systems and decision support systems area by providing new information about the potential benefits of SaaS-based IES, in addition to a variety of factors that may influence the achievement of benefits. The main findings of this thesis are summarised as a benefits framework and a benefits influence model. These models offer a starting point for future academic SaaS-based IES research, in terms of SMEs. They also provide SME practitioners with a framework of what to expect from SaaS-based IES, aiding them in evaluating and planning <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Systems...|$|E
