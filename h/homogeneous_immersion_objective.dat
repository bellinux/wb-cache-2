While the performance of these objectives for depth profiling planar structures has been discussed at length in the literature, the same comparison {{has not yet been}} made for 3 D mapping of complex objects, where additional complications are introduced by non-planar geometries. Studying samples with increasing complexity shows that the oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> is strongly preferred because it yields brighter images with better contrast, and eliminates some new and confusing artefacts that do not arise with simple planar objects...|$|R
50|$|Water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> {{are used}} {{not only at}} very large magnifications that require high resolving power, but also of {{moderate}} power as there are water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> as low as 4X. Objectives with high power magnification have short focal lengths, facilitating the use of water. The water {{is applied to the}} specimen (conventional microscope), and the stage is raised, immersing the objective in water. Sometimes with water dipping objectives, the objective is directly immersed in the solution of water which contains the specimens to look at. Electrophoretic preparations used in the case of comet assay can benefit from the use of water objectives.|$|R

Live imaging was performed using an Olympus FV 1000 confocal microscope (Olympus Scientific Solutions America, Waltham, MA, USA) {{equipped with a}} 60 ×/ 1.2 water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> and a 515 -nm laser for excitation. Prior to imaging, a drop of perfluorodecalin [33] {{was placed on the}} leaf tissue to remove air pockets from intercellular spaces and ensure good optical quality. YFP fluorescence was detected through a 535 - to 575 -nm bandpass filter, while the chlorophyll autofluorescence was collected in the 670 - to 700 -nm range. Sections from resin-embedded tissue after HPF–FS were mounted in immersion oil and imaged using a 100 ×/ 1.4 oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|R
50|$|In light microscopy, a water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> is a {{specially}} designed objective lens used to increase {{the resolution of the}} microscope.

40|$|Cryogenic {{fluorescent}} light microscopy of flash-frozen cells stands out by artifact-free fixation {{and very little}} photobleaching of the fluorophores used. To attain {{the highest level of}} resolution, aberration-free <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> with accurately matched immersion media are required, but both do not exist for imaging below the glass-transition temperature of water. Here, we resolve this challenge by combining a cryoimmersion medium, HFE- 7200, which matches the refractive index of room-temperature water, with a technological concept in which the body of the objective and the front lens are not in thermal equilibrium. We implemented this concept by replacing the metallic front-lens mount of a standard bioimaging water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> with an insulating ceramic mount heated around its perimeter. In this way, the objective metal housing can be maintained at room temperature, while creating a thermally shielded cold microenvironment around the sample and front lens. To demonstrate the range of potential applications, we show that our method can provide superior contrast in Escherichia coli and yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteins and resolve submicrometer structures in multicolor immunolabeled human bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U 2 OS) cells at − 140 °C...|$|R

50|$|With no {{modification}} to the microscope, i.e. with {{a simple}} wide field light microscope, the quality of optical sectioning is governed by the same physics as the depth of field effect in photography. For a high numerical aperture lens, equivalent to a wide aperture, the depth of field is small (shallow focus) and gives good optical sectioning. High magnification objective lenses typically have higher numerical apertures (and so better optical sectioning) than low magnification <b>objectives.</b> Oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> typically have even larger numerical apertures so improved optical sectioning.|$|R

Oberhaeuser eventually withdrew from the day to day business of the firm, naming Hartnack as his successor in 1864. By the late 1850s Oberhaeuser and Hartnack had already redesigned their objectives, again following the lead of Amici, to give larger usable apertures and higher resolution. The new series, including their water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives,</b> would set the standard for excellence for several years. [...] Georges Oberhaeuser died in Paris in 1868.|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> with a high numerical aperture.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{increasing}} numerical aperture, {{there are}} few techniques available to improve optical sectioning in bright-field light microscopy. Most microscopes with oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> are reaching the limits of numerical aperture possible due to refraction limits.Differential interference contrast (DIC) provides modest improvements to optical sectioning. In DIC the sample is effectively illuminated by two slightly offset light sources which then interfere to produce an image resulting from the phase differences of the two sources. As the offset in the light sources is small the only difference in phase results from the material close to the focal plane.|$|R
