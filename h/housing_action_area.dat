50|$|The {{majority}} of the housing dates {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century, and like Newfoundpool was developed mainly by local builder Orson Wright. Before that time the area north of Woodgate, known as St Leonard's, was the principal residential area, and had been so for many centuries. Woodgate was a <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Area</b> in the late 1980s, when many properties were refurbished by Leicester City Council, and it forms part of the current regeneration plans for the city.|$|E
50|$|The Housing Act 1974 gave {{many private}} tenants {{the right to}} {{additional}} information as to the identity of their landlord, {{and there was also}} a new duty to inform a tenant of a dwelling of the assignment of a landlord’s interest. It extended the right to information about service charges and introduced the right to challenge them. The form and content of certain notices to quit was to be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Secretary of State and the improvement grant system was re-vamped. <b>Housing</b> <b>action</b> <b>areas,</b> general improvement areas and priority neighbourhoods were introduced.|$|R
50|$|As a {{means of}} {{improving}} the living standards of those in receipt of state benefits, the government index-linked short-term benefits to the rate of inflation, while pensions and long-term benefits were tied to increases in prices or earnings, whichever was higher (previously, benefit increases were tied only to prices). In addition, new benefits for the disabled and infirm were introduced whilst pensioners benefited from the largest ever increase in pensions up until that period. New employment legislation strengthened equal pay provisions, guaranteed payments for workers on short-time and temporarily laid-off and introduced job security and maternity leave for pregnant women. Housing rehabilitation was encouraged via the establishment of <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Areas</b> and better improvement grants, whilst public sector housing completions rose 40,000 from the 111,500 achieved in 1974, before falling to barely 95,000 by 1979. In addition, furnished tenants were finally provided with security of tenure.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the impacts}} of housing renewal {{policies}} has become an increasingly complex task. First, evaluation must recognise the changing urban context within which policies operate, notably the revitalisation of some inner-city areas {{through the process of}} gentrification. Secondly, and more importantly, housing renewal policies should be viewed in the wider context of urban policy. Yet competing frameworks are available for judging success in urban policy terms. These take opposing views of whether gentrification should be considered a desirable outcome. The article illustrates these points by drawing on a recent evaluation of {{the impacts of}} the <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Areas</b> programme in Scotland. It shows that contrasting approaches to implementing renewal were adopted in the two main cities and that the impacts of renewal varied as a result. Judgement of the 'success' of each approach is shown to depend upon the framework used. The findings also suggest that the state may {{play a major role in}} influencing the process of restructuring under way in many cities...|$|R
5000|$|In 1970 a {{team from}} Strathclyde University {{demonstrated}} that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms. The Corporation acted on this principle {{for the first time}} in 1973 at the Old Swan Corner, Pollokshaws. Thereafter, <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Areas</b> were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in [...] "stone cleaning", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed [...] "grey" [...] tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a [...] "universally admired architectural" [...] style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.|$|R
50|$|In housing policy, a {{shift of}} {{emphasis}} in housing policy towards rehabilitation {{was evident in the}} further {{increase in the number of}} General Improvement Areas and the number of <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Areas</b> declared. An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with Attendance Allowances extended to cover handicapped foster children and non-contributory disablement pensions extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. In July 1977, an experimental Job Introduction Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there was reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job. In July 1978, a revised and simplified scheme designed to assist severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Being {{a planned}} township, New Town has been {{divided into three}} areas: <b>Action</b> <b>Area</b> - I, mainly {{consisting}} of malls, a Sub-CBD, and planned residential and commercial plots; <b>Action</b> <b>Area</b> - II is supposedly planned to have a main central business district (CBD), institutional plots, IT Business Parks like DLF, TCS Gitanjali Park and Unitech, City Center2 and plots for large apartment complexes, it will also house the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art, an open landscape with an Eco-park built around a water body; <b>Action</b> <b>Area</b> IIC has many residential housing projects like Hiland Woods, Akankha, Sunrise Point, Moonbeam <b>Housing,</b> Starlit etc.; <b>Action</b> <b>Area</b> - III mainly consists of high-rise residential complexes and mini sub-townships like Uniworld City and Sukhobristi and upscale gated residential communities such as DLF Newtown Heights, Shrachi's Rosedale, Unitech's Uniworld City, Tata's Eden Court and Keppel's Elita Garden Vista now being developed by a consortium of Sureka, Merlin and JB. Various educational institutes such as University of Engineering & Management, IIT Kharagpur, St Xaviers College and IT majors Infosys and Wipro have set up their campuses there, along with overseas firms like BT Group.

40|$|The {{inability}} {{of the social sciences}} to contribute to the better understanding of the intraurban problems of contemporary society has provided the primary influence for an approach that is strongly grounded in the method and philosophy of social analysis. The underlying aim is to reinterpret the 'theory 1 of residential differentiation away from the classical ecology of the Chicago School and towards Neo-Marxism. The thesis divides into three main sections. The first discusses the theoretical formation of social science using, partially, the conceptual outline of Strasser with the aim of making the geographer not only. re cognise his own perspective (ideology) but also of locating this and competing perspectives in time and social structure. Metaphysical theories of society are examined and the myths of orthodox positivist social analysis, particularly the Chicago School and later factorial ecologists, are critically evaluated. The second section is an orthodox empirical analysis of the spatial extent and the concentration of deprivation utilising standard statistical techniques. The operationalising of this part of the research is based on data collected for Bradford County Borough. The main data source has been the 1971 Census Small Ward Library for 632 enumeration districts. Fifty-four variables have been selected to cover the complete range of demographic, ethnic, migratory, economic activity, social, commuting and housing characteristics likely to be relevant. A large range of single and multi-factor indices of deprivation have been computed in the positivist tradition to delineate <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Areas</b> and General Improvement Areas. For example, a multi-factor index has been computed using 14 census variables by transforming them into Z-scores with means of zero and unit variance; these have been used to give a composite. index of the spatial coincidence of areas with high levels of deprivation. The central tenets of ecological theory are derived from several factorial ecologies and cluster analyses (both R- and Q- mode). The technical and methodological problems of multifactor designs are discussed at length and concluded as providing serious 'negative 1 effects in which error compounding can further detract from the soundness of the corpus of ecological theory. The third and final section is a re-evaluation of the patterns of segregation observed in the factor ecological maps that attempts to consider the dialectics of post industrial capitalist society. The differentiating factor of social groups in space is seen to lie in the broader forces of class structuration. The primary force is the power relation between capital and labour, though it is also recognised that secondary (or, better, supportive) forces arise from the necessity of preserving the process of capital accumulation. The key theoretical link between the primary social relation and the role of space is made with the help of Lamarche's exposition on the concept of the circulation of capital. The aim of the thesis is to achieve higher levels of explanation for the segregation of different social groups throughout, and for the social networks of housing intermediaries within, urban spaceparticularly as this is revealed by the disadvantaged members of society. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{state of}} Castle Vale became a serious concern for Birmingham City Council and in July 1991, Derek Waddington, the then {{director}} of housing for Birmingham City Council, {{heard about a}} <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> Trust in North Hull. After further research, he recommended this to Dick Knowles, then leader of Birmingham City Council, for Castle Vale. He produced a presentation to the council in Autumn 1991 to convince the council of {{the potential of the}} scheme. The following day, the council approached the Department for the Environment, the predecessor to the Department for Communities and Local Government, on how to approach the establishment of a <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> Trust at Castle Vale. In December 1991, Michael Heseltine announced to Parliament that Castle Vale had become the latest candidate for <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> Trust status. In 1992, Richard Temple Cox, a local architect, was appointed shadow chairman for the <b>Housing</b> <b>Action</b> Trust and was given the job of persuading residents on the estate to vote in favour of establishing the HAT. He entered negotiations with a Community Action Team, which had been established for the estate in 1992, to determine the size and composition of the board for the HAT. They agreed on a board of twelve members, with four resident representatives, three local authority councillors, and five independent members.|$|R
