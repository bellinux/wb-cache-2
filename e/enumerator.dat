40|$|The formal weight <b>enumerators</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} by M. Ozeki. They form {{a ring of}} invariant polynomials {{which is similar to}} that of the weight <b>enumerators</b> of Type II codes. Later, the zeta functions for linear codes were discovered and their theory was developed by I. Duursma. It was generalized to certain invariant polynomials including Ozeki's formal weight <b>enumerators</b> by the present author. One of the famous and important problems is whether extremal weight <b>enumerators</b> satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. In this paper, first we formulate the notion of divisible formal weight <b>enumerators</b> and propose an algorithm for the efficient search of the formal weight <b>enumerators</b> divisible by two. The main tools are the binomial moments. It leads to the discovery of several new families of formal weight <b>enumerators.</b> Then, as a result, we find examples of extremal formal weight <b>enumerators</b> which do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis.

40|$|AbstractThe MacWilliams {{identity}} {{for the complete}} m-spotty weight <b>enumerators</b> of byte-organized binary codes is a generalization of that for the Hamming weight <b>enumerators</b> of binary codes. In this paper, Jacobi forms are obtained by substituting theta series into the complete m-spotty weight <b>enumerators</b> of binary Type II codes. The Mellin transforms of those theta series provide functional equations for partial Epstein zeta functions which are summands of classical Epstein zeta functions associated with quadratic forms. Then, {{it is observed that}} the coefficient matrices appearing in those functional equations are exactly the same as the transformation matrices in the MacWilliams {{identity for}} the complete m-spotty weight <b>enumerators</b> of binary self-dual codes...|$|R

25|$|The {{decennial census}} {{has been the}} method of {{collecting}} United Kingdom-wide population-based statistics since 1801. Currently the UK census is governed by the Census Act 1920. However, prior to 1841 it {{was no more than}} a headcount. Since 1841, except in 1941 when no census took place due to the Second World War, detail was gathered about the household. Until the 1901 the enumerators were responsible for completing census <b>enumerator</b> sheets, transcribing the details included in household schedules completed by the head of the household. From the 1911 census onwards an individual census form, provided by and returned to an <b>enumerator,</b> was completed by the head of the household and became the primary source of demographic data. In 2001 census returns were for the first time sent out by post, but were collected by enumerators. The 2011 UK Census was the first time, individual census forms were issued through the Royal Mail and could also be returned by post, except in Scotland where instead they were collected by enumerators. Census forms could also be completed and submitted through the internet by the householder. In recent times, combined with other data, the ten-yearly census has provided the basis of socio-economic statistics used by all branches of national and local government, the Public Services and the private sector.|$|E

It was a four-room corner house in a back-to-back row on the corner with Cambridge Road. This was a street of back-to-back houses, but is now a row of trees on a playing field. In the 1911 Census he was aged 17 years, he had no siblings {{and he was a}} lithographic artist apprentice, living with his parents in a back-to-back house at 49 Ganton Mount at Woodhouse, Leeds; the street is now rebuilt as modern houses. In 1911 his father was a journeyman joiner, and his mother a housewife.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this thesis}} is linear codes over rings. In the first part, we look at linear codes over Galois rings, and using the {{homogeneous}} weight, we improve upon Wilson's results about the prime power that divides the coefficients of the homogeneous weight <b>enumerators</b> of these codes. We also prove that our results are best possible. Our results about homogeneous weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes over Galois rings generalize the results that we have for the Lee weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes over the ring of integers modulo 4. We also consider other weight <b>enumerators,</b> in particular the complete weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes and we obtain MacWilliams-like identities for these weight <b>enumerators</b> considering different rings. These MacWilliams-like identities lead to MacWilliams identities for the Hamming weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes over rings. We also give a counter-example {{to show that we}} cannot have MacWilliams-like identities for the Euclidean weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes over the ring of integers modulo 4. We also look at Gray maps from Galois rings to the finite field of prime size. We first give an application of the distance preserving Gray maps to obtain good ternary codes, and then we give an inductive algebraic construction of a distance preserving Gray map from Galois rings with the homogeneous distance to the field of prime size with the Hamming distance as well as a combinatorial construction. By using the Gray maps, we obtain some results about the weight <b>enumerators</b> of linear codes over the ring of dual numbers. In the last part of this work, we consider the permutation invariance of binary codes and the connection with linearity over certain rings. Among the rings considered, we have different variations and extensions of the ring of dual numbers. In this context we consider the Reed-Muller codes and answer questions about permutation invariance of Reed-Muller codes under certain permutation groups and the linearity of Reed-Muller codes over these aforementioned rings...|$|R

2500|$|Dennis Pennington (May 18, 1776 – September 2, 1854) was {{a farmer}} and a stonemason who became {{known for his}} many years in public office as an early {{legislator}} in the Indiana Territory and in Indiana's General Assembly {{as a representative of}} Harrison County, Indiana. Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census <b>enumerator</b> in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, {{and a member of the}} Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana.

2500|$|Around about 1910 the Borough Police {{acquired}} four police horses. They {{were purchased}} {{and used for}} crowd control with the horses being stabled in the yard at the Harrison Road Police Station, having their names over their stable doors. Four horses were photographed in the Mounted Police Section in 1930 {{as part of the}} annual inspection of the Halifax Borough Police of that year by Sir Llewelyn Atcherley, His Majesty's Inspector of Police, with Chief Constable Richardson. The Suffragettes were holding meetings that often ended with crowd trouble and there were many strikes at local works and on the railways in the offing at Halifax. A year later a car was purchased for Halifax police use and bicycle use had reached a peak by this time. Also, a motorbike and sidecar unit was formed and based at Harrison Road. 1911 saw the first national census when the householder presented the census form as opposed to giving verbal details to an <b>enumerator.</b> On 18 May 1912 there was a special meeting of the Watch Committee and it was resolved 'That the Police Standing Orders be reprinted as amended and re-published to the Force.' This was an update of the booklet published on 7 May 1906 and reflected the improved conditions of the Police Force and reaffirmed that the Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to conform. On 11 July 1912 King George V and Queen Mary visited Clough Mill, a factory site near Halifax. This entailed a heavy police presence and a large amount of police activity to ensure their security. Alfred Richardson was later to become recognised for a particular police security procedure he created for this event which had the security and police activity highly organised. Always involved with Police Pensions, Alfred Richardson added to the Family Archives a newspaper article from Sheffield where a Quarter Sessions Judge gave police officers consideration where the house, free gas and coal were supplied when calculating that officer's pension. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined up as a Territorial, in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment which had a long-standing association with Halifax. He was the Assistant Provost Marshall and given the rank of Major. Alfred Richardson {{was in charge of the}} Harrow Dog Kennels near Halifax, which provided dogs for the war effort. During the early days of World War I, Chief Constable Alfred Herbert Richardson was in charge of the kennels. They provided dogs for use in the trenches, for scouting with soldiers and for use in sentry duty at isolated posts. [...] In 1914, he served with the 4th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment and as a Major was the Halifax Recruiting Officer with the Regiment.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the recent}} {{advances}} {{in the area of}} low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, protograph-based LDPC codes have the advantages of a simple design procedure and highly structured encoders and decoders. These advantages can also be exploited in the design of protograph-based generalized LDPC (G-LDPC) codes. In this dissertation we provide analytical tools which aid the design of protograph-based LDPC and G-LDPC codes. Specifically, we propose a method for computing the codeword-weight <b>enumerators</b> for finite-length protograph-based G-LDPC code ensembles, and then we consider the asymptotic case when the block-length goes to infinity. These results help the designer identify good ensembles of protograph-based G-LDPC codes in the minimum distance sense (i. e., ensembles which have minimum distances grow linearly with code length). Furthermore, good code ensembles can be characterized by good stopping set, trapping set, or pseudocodeword properties, which assist in the design of G-LDPC codes with low floors. We leverage our method for computing codeword-weight <b>enumerators</b> to compute stopping-set, and pseudocodeword <b>enumerators</b> for the finite-length and the asymptotic ensembles of protograph-based G-LDPC codes. Moreover, we introduce a method for computing trapping set <b>enumerators</b> for finite-length (and asymptotic) protograph-based LDPC code ensembles. Trapping set <b>enumerators</b> for G-LDPC codes represents a more complex problem which we do not consider here. Inspired by our method for computing trapping set <b>enumerators</b> for protograph-based LDPC code ensembles, we developed an algorithm for estimating the trapping set <b>enumerators</b> for a specific LDPC code given its parity-check matrix. We used this algorithm to enumerate trapping sets for several LDPC codes from communication standards. Finally, we study coded-modulation schemes with LDPC codes and pulse position modulation (LDPC-PPM) over the free-space optical channel. We present three different decoding schemes and compare their performances. In addition, we developed a new density evolution tool for use in the design of LDPC codes with good performances over this channel...|$|R
