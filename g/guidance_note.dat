500|$|Jones' career {{took place}} against a {{backdrop}} of increasing professionalization and commercialization of archaeology, which Jones herself had a hand in birthing. During her work as a freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works in the 1950s and 60s, Jones saw the rapid destruction of archaeological sites by construction and development, and bemoaned the lack of resources allocated to properly documenting it. Jones and her colleagues were paid only a day-rate for time spent digging and the costs directly incurred, precluding any post-excavation analysis or publication of their finds. Although Mucking was the largest excavation in the country for over a decade, she ran it on a shoestring budget, relying heavily on volunteer labour. In 1973 she was involved in founding the campaign group Rescue, which lobbied for increased government funding for rescue archaeology. This initiative was ultimately successful, increasingly shifting the labour of pre-development excavation from volunteers to professional archaeologists, and culminating in the creation of modern commercial archaeology with the publication of Planning Policy <b>Guidance</b> <b>Note</b> 16 in 1991. According to her obituarist Mike Pitts, Jones also influenced the formation of modern rescue archaeology in Britain by demonstrating [...] "dogged salvage excavation on a grand scale" [...] at Mucking.|$|E

An eight lesson teaching-learning sequence was designed, consequently implemented and evaluated in two pilot studies and two teaching experiments. In the teaching experiments the teaching-learning sequence was implemented by two Finnish teachers (transfer teachers) who were not engaged in the planning of the sequence. The teacher in the second teaching experiment followed the <b>guidance</b> <b>notes</b> better than in the first, which may have resulted from the changes in the teaching-learning sequence and adjustment of the <b>guidance</b> <b>notes</b> following the first teaching experiment.
