40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{substantiate}} the use expediency of the new algorithm of the neck of the uterus neoplasia diagnosis and to evaluate the approach effectiveness. An optical coherent tomography (OCT) has been used in this research. Materials and methods. 380 patients with all the spectrum of the neck of the uterus states have been examined. Under the investigation there have been cytological investigation, and a HPV-test, a colposcopic examination, an OCT, a morphological investigation. Results. An OCT is capable of visualizing the neck of the uterus mucous membrane at the layers level and intratissue elements. A method sensibility in recognition of a mucous membrane neoplasia is 82 %, a specificity is 78 %, the errors — 19. 2 % (k= 0. 65). An OCT-investigation is compatible with colposcopy in real clinical conditions. It is capable of differentiating the colposcopic signs according to a possible malignization risk based on optical picture types. An OCT as a diagnostic algorithm allows to reveal the neck of the uterus pathology and to decrease the biopsy volume by 34 %. Conclusion. A complementary use of colposcopy and OCT makes it possible to avoid not only random biopsies, but significantly decrease a number of wrong manipulations (more than by 30 %). An OCT method is certain to be included into the algorithm of the neck of the uterus examination at a stage of the <b>indication</b> <b>detection</b> and a biopsy site selection carrying out colposcopic investigation. This is sure to increase effectiveness of the precancer and cancer early diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|The goal of ECOSSIAN {{project is}} to create a {{platform}} that detects, analyses and responds to security incidents and attacks on critical infrastructures, specifically in industrial control systems. The platform should operate on three interconnected levels: operator, national, EUwide. This document describes the requirements that the ECOSSIAN system should realise in order to successfully deal with this task. The requirements include both mandatory ones that are essential for a proof-on-concept system, and optional ones that increase the value, capabilities, or user-friendliness of the final system in production. Chapter 1 describes the characteristics of the ECOSSIAN system. These characteristics form the basis for further requirements. The chapter also introduces the classification of requirements by type and importance. Chapter 2 contains the list of system and architecture requirements. This includes architectural requirements for the system’s construction; data requirements for the format and content of the data, processed at all three levels (operator, national, EU-wide); common operational picture, situation awareness, and visualization requirements; requirements for successful forensic investigations; integration and interoperability capabilities. Chapter 3 lists functional requirements of the system, which ultimately formulate what the system is supposed to do. The chapter lists functional modules of the system, and explains the detailed functions that each module should have. The modules include organizational and concept requirements; threat monitoring, <b>indication,</b> <b>detection</b> and early warning; risk analysis and impact assessment; cooperation between users and organizations; response capabilities, i. e. threat mitigation, planning, incident management, decision support, and recovery; and training and exercising module.

40|$|Mechanical {{failure in}} {{aircraft}} workpieces is likely from happening, if open to surface discontinuities which comprise stress concentration regions are present. The {{fluorescent penetrant inspection}} (FPI) is a sensitive nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method capable to verify the presence of indications in surface of raw materials or of processed parts or parts submitted to service charges. In general, when FPI inspection is being conducted, an inspector performs an evaluation of a treated surface based on his knowledge and experience in nondestructive testing, being the defect detection a qualitative decision according to his/her judgment. In this case, the inspector’s vision acuity, attitude and motivation can compromise the analysis in inspection. The automation in inspection may improve the repeatability of this NDE method, regarding that machine vision systems classify parts considering quantitative analysis of objective data. Algorithms for the feature extraction are run, providing features for a data analysis procedure which classifies the detected indications as relevant or irrelevant indications according to specification or code. Therefore, the machine vision systems, when applied to fluorescent penetrant inspection, improve the overall technique reliability, guaranteeing automatic storage, retrieval and feedback of data for controlling the manufacturing and maintenance of equipments. In the literature, there are several examples of machine vision systems: For example, the laser scanning systems, as proposed in Tracy and Moore (2001), is a good approach for the inspection automation. In this system, a focused laser beam spot is translated over the specimen surface and a photodetector measures the amount of fluorescence in that illuminated area whose power is directly proportional to the quantity of penetrant trapped in surface cavities (Tracy and Moore (2001)). Other manner which was proposed by Armstrong (1986) is to illuminate a treated sample with a standard UV lamp in dark booth and acquire images formed by fluorescent bright indications using a camera. In this work, an ultraviolet <b>indication</b> <b>detection</b> system was developed for the automation of the inspection stage in FPI. Only open to surface indications are capable to be detected through the system. It measures the area and maximum euclidean distance and classifies the shape of indications. They are feasible to be evaluated according to predefined quality standards. Metrics such as the probability of detection curves were traced, obtaining a capability of 21. 6 microns of depth with 100...|$|E

40|$|Subject of {{this work}} is the {{clinical}} validation of correlative interpretation of SPECT images and anatomical crossectional modalities concerning the anatomical localization and the impact on therapy planning. For the comparison of functional and anatomical imaging modalities different methods were used: side-by-side analysis (SBS) of separate image data sets, software aided coregitration or integrated hybrid systems, the latter allowing an almost simultaneous acquisition of SPECT- and CT-data in one examination. These methods were analysed for various clinical <b>indications</b> (<b>detection</b> of recurrent brain tumors, preoperative localisation of parathyroid adenomas, diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, detection of recurrent head and neck cancer, and determination of liver perfusion territories of intraarterial liver port systems.) These projects demonstrate potential fields if indications and the respective technical limitation for the clinical use of SPECT-fusion imaging modalities. The analyses show that coregistration of SPECT- and anatomical image-data can be reliable used in daily routine. Further on the results demonstrate a superiority of image fusion methods in comparison on interpretation of SPECT alone and side-by-side analysis of different imaging methods.

Digital volume tomograms (DVT) were obtained by the prototype of GALILEOS (Sirona Dental Systems Inc., Bensheim, Germany), a newly developed, compact size, cone-beam machine with a scan volume of 15 cm × 15 cm × 15 cm. Intraoperative navigation was performed in 12 patients in three selected <b>indications.</b> Target <b>detection</b> error expressing the accuracy of DVT navigation and registration performance of specially developed methods for image-to-patient registration was estimated.

The preoperatively defined treatment plan was fully accomplished in 11 out of 12 cases. A favourable surgical outcome was achievable in all cases. Intraoperative complications were not observed. Intraoperative navigation based on DVT imaging can be considered as a valuable alternative to CT-based procedures.

Third, a new class of AGN was discovered at energies above 100 MeV by EGRET. The power of these objects in gamma-rays can dominate the luminosity in other spectral ranges. These objects are associated with extragalactic sources that have blazar properties. The high-energy gamma-ray emission is probably produced in relativistically outflowing jets.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Laboratory and {{epidemiologic}} {{studies have}} suggested a modifying effect of cardiac glycosides (for example, digoxin and digitoxin) on cancer risk. We explored the association between digoxin treatment and invasive breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal Danish women. METHODS. We used Danish registries to identify 5, 565 postmenopausal women diagnosed with incident invasive breast carcinoma between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 2007, and 55, 650 matched population controls. Cardiac glycoside prescriptions were ascertained from county prescription registries. All subjects had at least 2 years of recorded prescription drug and medical history data. We estimated the odds ratio associating digoxin use with breast cancer in conditional logistic regression models adjusted for age, county of residence, and use of anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and hormone replacement therapy. We also explored the impact of confounding by <b>indication</b> and <b>detection</b> bias. RESULTS. Digoxin was the sole cardiac glycoside prescribed to subjects during the study period. There were 324 breast cancer cases (5. 8 %) and 2, 546 controls (4. 6 %) {{with a history of}} digoxin use at least 1 year before their index date (adjusted odds ratio (OR) : 1. 30; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 14 to 1. 48). The breast cancer OR increased modestly with increasing duration of digoxin exposure (adjusted OR for 7 to 18 years of digoxin use: 1. 39; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 10 to 1. 74). The association was robust to adjustment for age, receipt of hormone replacement therapy, coprescribed drugs, and confounding by indication. A comparison of screening mammography rates between cases and controls showed no evidence of detection bias. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that digoxin treatment increases the risk of invasive breast cancer among postmenopausal women.

The Barrier Placement Machine (BPM) removes spoils from under a landfill or plume and places it on a conveyor belt {{on the left and}} right sides of the BPM. The spoils will travel down the conveyor belts past assay monitors and be deposited on top of the site being worked. The belts are 5 ft wide and transport approximately 15 ft 3 /minute of spoils. This corresponds to a 10 ft per hour BPM advance rate. With a 2 in. spoils height the belt speed would be 3. 6 in. per second. The spoils being removed are expected to be {open_quotes}clean{close_quotes} (no radiation or volatile organics above background levels). To ensure that the equipment is not digging through a contaminated area, assay equipment will monitor the spoils for mg radiation and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The radiation monitors will check for gross radiation <b>indication.</b> Upon <b>detection</b> of radiation levels above a predetermined setpoint, further evaluation will be performed to determine the isotopes present and their quantity.

40|$|PURPOSE: Radiation {{protection}} {{is a major}} issue since the implementation of MSCT technology and its widespread <b>indication</b> for the <b>detection</b> of various diseases. In a European-wide trial (SECT) meta-analyses of imaging alternatives to CT have been initiated. This paper focuses on the diagnostic performance of transthoracic ultrasound (TUS) for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) (5 studies, 652 patients). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical literature (from 1990 to 2006) in PubMed and EMBASE databases was searched for articles on studies that used TUS as diagnostic tests for PE. Studies were included if they reported {{the positive and negative}} rates of PE diagnoses from TUS compared with the rates of PE in CT, MRI or a combination of diagnostic tests. Two readers assessed the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Pooled sensitivity and specificity of TUS for PE were 80 % (95 % CI: 75 %, 83 %) and 93 % (95 % CI: 89 %, 96 %), respectively. CONCLUSION: In the time of MSCT, TUS is an imaging modality that is no longer part of recent diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of PE. Considering the increasing number of requested CT examinations and therefore increasing collective radiation dose, this meta-analysis shows that TUS is a diagnostic alternative for special clinical settings in the work-up of suspected PE that seems to have fallen into oblivion...|$|R

Positive CE diagnosis occurred in 63 % of cases. The preparation method did not significantly affect the quality of bowel preparation for CE. The overall incomplete rate was 33 %, and was high in the elderly and those with poor bowel preparation. Capsule retention was 3 % and high in patients with small bowel tumors and Crohn&# 39;s disease and in children under 10 years of age. Conclusions CE is a valuable technique; while the overall detection rate is high, incompletion and retention rates are also relatively high. CE should be carefully considered in the elderly and children less than 10 years of age, as well as in patients with small bowel tumors and Crohn&# 39;s disease...|$|R
