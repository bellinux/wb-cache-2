25|$|The {{cooperation}} of a Democratic administration {{with the issue}} of civil rights marked a pivotal moment in voter alignment within the U.S. The Democratic Party gave up the Solid South—its undivided support since Reconstruction among the segregated Southern states—and went on to capture a high proportion of votes from blacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ellsworth {{scored a}} {{landslide}} victory over Hostettler on November 7, 2006. He took 61% {{of the vote}} to Hostettler's 39% – {{by far the most}} lopsided defeat for an incumbent in the 2006 election. Ellsworth's victory was the first of 30 seats that the Democrats took <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the cycle.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction {{following}} the American Civil War, Alabama {{was occupied by}} federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers {{took control of the}} state government <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, Feeney's {{district}} {{was one of}} five in Florida that Democrats hoped to win <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in 2008. Despite the perception that Feeney drew it for himself, it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+3, making it a fairly marginal district on paper. The district gave George W. Bush 52% {{of the vote in}} 2000, and 56% in 2004. It includes most of Democratic-leaning Volusia County.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{parliamentary}} elections were held on June 20. Victorious Adjara, party backed by President Saakashvili won 28 seats out of 30 {{in the local}} legislative body. The 2 other seats were occupied by Saakashvili's former allies, the Republican Party. There were allegations of vote-rigging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> after they won less than 15 per cent of the vote. On July 20, Adjarian Supreme Council approved Levan Varshalomidze as the Chairman of the Autonomous Republic's Government.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of the Bureau, the {{recently}} freed slaves began voting, forming political parties, and assuming the control of labor in many areas. The Bureau helped to start a change of power in the South that drew national attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the North to the conservative Democrats in the South. This is especially evident in the election between Grant and Seymour (Johnson did not get the Democratic nomination), where almost 700,000 black voters voted and swayed the election 300,000 votes in Grant's favor.|$|E

25|$|Charlie {{intended}} all of {{his children}} to be educated in the United States. Ai-Ling, at the early age of thirteen, {{was the first to}} go, becoming a special student at Wesleyan College in Georgia. All three sisters attended Wesleyan, with Ching-Ling and May-Ling moving to Georgia in 1907. Ai-Ling graduated in 1909, and moved back to China. Charlie installed her as Sun Yat-Sen’s secretary, in charge of handling his correspondence and of decoding messages to him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans.</b> A few years later in 1911, Sun Yat-Sen was successful in bringing about the Xinhai Revolution, and the Qing Dynasty fell to be replaced by the short-lived presidency of Sun Yat-Sen.|$|E
25|$|U.S. troops also {{blocked the}} White League Democrats in January 1875, {{after they had}} wrested <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> the {{organization}} of the state legislature. Nevertheless, the revolution of 1874 is generally regarded as the independence day of Reconstruction, although not until President Hayes withdrew the troops in 1877 and the Packard government fell did the Democrats actually hold control of the state and city. The financial condition of the city when the whites gained control was very bad. The tax-rate had risen in 1873 to 3%. The city defaulted in 1874. On the interest of its bonded debt, it later refunded this ($22,000,000 in 1875) at a lower rate, to decrease the annual charge from $1,416,000 to $307,500.|$|E
25|$|Events soon removed much of {{the basis}} for the split in the women's movement. In 1870, debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made {{irrelevant}} when that amendment was officially ratified. In 1872, disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> to the short-lived Liberal Republican Party. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more exclusively on women's suffrage rather than a variety of women's issues. The rivalry between the two women's groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible for twenty years. The AWSA, which was especially strong in New England, was the larger of the two organizations, but it began to decline in strength during the 1880s.|$|E

The leader of the Nationalist forces surrounding Asturias, General Dávila, attacked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east, expecting little resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> demoralized <b>Republicans.</b>|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} third occupation, General Álvarez cut off all {{communication}} with the mainland and prevented any supplies or reinforcements from reaching the city. Colonel Montenegro, the commander of Acapulco, had been ordered to hold himself in readiness to evacuate Acapulco right {{after the completion of}} the evacuation of Mazatlán, which it was supposed would take place about October 15, 1866. His orders were to begin the evacuation 24-hours after receiving the notice and to destroy all stores and supplies that could not be carried on board. However French troops requested a delay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in February 1867, while the commanding Imperialist General issued an emergency tax of $20,000 exclusively on the American citizens of the port to fund the costs of the evacuation and his own emigration and permanently left Acapulco along with his last 200 men on the 19th to San Blas aboard the steamship Victoire.|$|E
500|$|After the Democrats' 1951 electoral victory, Philadelphia's once-powerful Republican party {{organization}} {{lost the}} hold on city government {{that they had}} held since 1884. In 1953, they sought to regain their former control over the city's political scene. Both sides presented the election as {{a referendum on the}} administration of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr., a Democrat elected with the support of reform-minded Republicans and independents in 1951. In an op-ed in The Philadelphia Inquirer the Sunday before the election, Republican City Committee chairman William J. Hamilton called the election [...] "an opportunity to pass judgment upon the administration of Mayor Clark who promised so much and gave so little." [...] He called the Clark administration [...] "spendthrift and mismanaged", and promised [...] "honest and efficient management" [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> In another op-ed the same day, Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green Jr., characterized the Clark administration in more glowing terms and framed the election as a chance for Philadelphians to decide [...] "whether 'good government' shall be extended" [...] in the city after the reforms of 1951.|$|E
500|$|By 1952, McGovern {{was coming}} to {{think of himself as}} a Democrat. He was captivated by a radio {{broadcast}} of Governor Adlai Stevenson's speech accepting the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention [...] He immediately dedicated himself to Stevenson's campaign, publishing seven articles in the Mitchell Daily Republic newspaper outlining the historical issues that separated the Democratic Party <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> The McGoverns named their only son Steven, born immediately after the convention, after his new hero. Although Stevenson lost the election, McGovern remained active in politics, believing that [...] "the engine of progress in our time in America is the Democratic Party". In early 1953, McGovern left a tenure-track position at the university to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party, the state chair having recruited him after reading his articles. Democrats in the state were at a low, holding no statewide offices and only 2 of the 110 seats in the state legislature. Friends and political figures had counseled McGovern against making the move, but despite his mild, unassuming manner, McGovern had an ambitious nature and was intent upon starting a political career of his own.|$|E

2500|$|During Reconstruction, Mississippi had {{considerable}} insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain supremacy. In 1875, the Red Shirts were formed, {{one of a}} second wave of insurgent paramilitary organizations that essentially operated as [...] "the military arm of the Democratic Party" [...] to take back political power <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and to drive blacks from the polls. Democrats regained {{control of the state}} legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced Mississippi's Constitution of 1890, was also held at the capitol.|$|E
