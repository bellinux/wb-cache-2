5000|$|In March 1945, in what would've {{been his}} 64th mission, Martin was [...] "cut down by ground fire" [...] after an attack mission on an enemy {{airfield}} in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. In his own words, Martin explained that seven other pilots and himself {{were attempting to}} shoot two airplanes parked a little bit off a field. They missed their target, and were blown off course by 100 mph winds. Martin felt a bump in his airplane and realized he had been hit. <b>The</b> engine caught <b>on</b> fire and Martin was forced to bail. When his parachute opened <b>it</b> cut him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> and knocked him out. Martin found shelter in a farmhouse. He was eventually rescued and taken into the headquarters of Marshal Josip Broz Tito's Partisans, and hidden until he could safely return to his unit. He remained there for about five weeks.|$|R

5000|$|Full idioms are the {{canonical}} cases of non-compositional meaning. The fixed words of idioms do not bear their productive meaning, e.g. take <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin.</b> Someone who [...] "takes {{it on the}} chin" [...] does not actually experience any physical contact to their chin, which means that chin does not have its normal productive meaning and must hence {{be part of a}} greater collocation. This greater collocation is the idiom, which consists of five words in this case. While the idiom take <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> can be stored as a VP constituent (and is therefore not a problem for constituent-based theories), there are many idioms that clearly cannot be stored as constituents. These idioms are a problem for constituent-based theories precisely because they do not qualify as constituents. However, they do of course qualify as catenae. The discussion here focuses on these idioms since they illustrate particularly well the value of the catena concept.|$|E

Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> fissure follows <b>the</b> fissure in the lower jaw bone that resulted from the incomplete fusion of {{the left and right}} halves of the jaw bone, or muscle, during the embryonal and fetal development. For other individuals, it can develop over time, often because one half of the jaw is longer than the other, leading to facial asymmetry.|$|R

50|$|Invited to the NCAA post-season {{playoffs for}} the second time in three years, the Bluejays took <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> twice to place fourth in the Midwest Regional tourney at Wichita, Kansas. In the opening round the Wichita University Shockers, {{complete}} with a near 10,000 home fan cheering section, bounced the Jays 68-83. An excessive amount of fouls plus some cold shooting doomed the Bluejays from the start. Creighton's Paul Silas held highly touted Shocker Dave Stallworth to one field goal and two free throws in the first half. Texas Western knocked off the Jays in the consolation game the following night 52-63. Poor foul shooting again plagued Creighton as they hit only 50 percent from the line. The Bluejays out-shot the Miners from the field 22-21.|$|E

5000|$|The name 'Harry Tates' {{dates back}} to the First World War and was used as jargon for {{anything}} clumsy and amateurish. It originated from an old music hall entertainer who would play the clumsy comic who couldn't get to grips with various contraptions. His act included a car that gradually fell apart around him. By the start of World War II it had been adopted by the Royal Navy and used for the purpose of poking fun at the trawlers and drifters of the Royal Naval Patrol Service. In true RNPS style they took <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> and the title of Harry Tate's Navy was proudly adopted. As the war went on it was to become a worthy password for courage.|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "The film's best visual humor arises from the mere juxtaposition of European settings with the funny hats, T-shirts and soda cans with which the Griswalds announce their presence." [...] Entertainment magazine Variety gave the film a negative review explaining, [...] "As the family of characters cartwheel through London, Paris, Italy and Germany - with the French deliciously taking <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> for their arrogance and rudeness - director Amy Heckerling gets carried away with physical humor while letting her American tourists grow tiresome and predictable.

50|$|According to Scott, Stalin {{chose to}} {{industrialize}} Magnitogorsk for several reasons, and integrated {{the construction of}} Magnitogorsk into a five-year economic plan. First, Stalin began to emphasize industrial modernization in favor of agriculture by the mid-1930s. Second, Magnitogorsk was rich in iron ore and other minerals. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Magnitogorsk lies far from any borders and was less vulnerable to enemy attack. The Russian people shed blood, sweat, and tears to create something else, a modern industrial base outside the reach of an invader—Stalin's Ural Stronghold—and modern mechanized army...the population was taught by a painful and expensive process to work efficiently, to obey orders, to mind their own business, and to take <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> when necessary {{with a minimum of}} complaint. These are the things that it takes to fight a modern war.|$|E
