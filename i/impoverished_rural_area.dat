40|$|Resilience, or {{adaptive}} {{behavior in the}} face of adversity, has recently come to be understood as a phenomenon that should not be uniformly conceptualized across contexts and cultures. This emerging understanding has urged exploration of what resilience might mean in specific cultural contexts. As in other majority nation contexts, there is scant documentation of what resilience might mean in an African context. In this article, the authors report on an exploratory qualitative study, rooted in a constructivist grounded theory approach, in which 11 South African adults from an <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> were invited to provide a description of resilient Basotho youth. In contrast to Eurocentric perspectives, their descriptions, verbal, written, and hand-drawn, offer an Africentric understanding of resilience. This emerging African conceptualization of resilience advocates for deeper exploration of collectivist philosophies underpinning Black youth resilience and continued research into the process of African resilience.

40|$|Abstract Background Estimation of {{maternal}} mortality is difficult {{in developing countries}} without complete vital registration. The indirect sisterhood method represents an alternative in places where there is high fertility and mortality rates. The objective {{of the current study}} was to estimate maternal mortality indices using the sisterhood method in a rural district in south-west Ethiopia. Method We interviewed 8, 870 adults, 15 – 49 years age, in 15 randomly selected rural villages of Bonke in Gamo Gofa. By constructing a retrospective cohort of women of reproductive age, we obtained sister units of risk exposure to maternal mortality, and calculated the lifetime risk {{of maternal}} mortality. Based on the total fertility for the rural Ethiopian population, the maternal mortality ratio was approximated. Results We analyzed 8503 of 8870 (96 %) respondents (5262 [62 %] men and 3241 ([38 %] women). The 8503 respondents reported 22, 473 sisters (average = 2. 6 sisters for each respondent) who survived to reproductive age. Of the 2552 (11. 4 %) sisters who had died, 819 (32 %) occurred during pregnancy and childbirth. This provided a lifetime risk of 10. 2 % from pregnancy and childbirth with a corresponding maternal mortality ratio of 1667 (95 % CI: 1564 – 1769) per 100, 000 live births. The time period for this estimate was in 1998. Separate analysis for male and female respondents provided similar estimates. Conclusion The <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> of Gamo Gofa had very high maternal mortality in 1998. This highlights the need for strengthening emergency obstetric care for the Bonke population and similar rural populations in Ethiopia. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Global {{research}} suggests that persons with disabilities face barriers when accessing health care services. Yet, information regarding {{the nature of these}} barriers, especially in low-income and middle-income countries is sparse. Rural contexts in these countries may present greater barriers than urban contexts, but little is known about access issues in such contexts. There is a paucity of research in South Africa looking at “triple vulnerability” – poverty, disability and rurality. This study explored issues of access to health care for persons with disabilities in an <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> in South Africa. Methods The study includes a quantitative survey with interviews with 773 participants in 527 households. Comparisons in terms of access to health care between persons with disabilities and persons with no disabilities were explored. The approach to data analysis included quantitative data analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. Frequency and cross tabulation, comparing and contrasting the frequency of different phenomena between persons with disabilities and persons with no disabilities, were used. Chi-square tests and Analysis of Variance tests were then incorporated into the analysis. Results Persons with disabilities have a higher rate of unmet health needs as compared to non-disabled. In rural Madwaleni in South Africa, persons with disabilities faced significantly more barriers to accessing health care compared to persons without disabilities. Barriers increased with disability severity and was reduced with increasing level of education, living in a household without disabled members and with age. Conclusions This study has shown that access to health care in a rural area in South Africa for persons with disabilities is more of an issue than for persons without disabilities in that they face more barriers. Implications are that we need to look beyond the medical issues of disability and address social and inclusion issues as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} founded upon the survey {{research}} in developmental aspirations and attitudes made in 1996 {{for the purpose}} of making the programme of spatial regulation of Licko-senjska County, which is undeveloped and <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area.</b> The research was carried out by means of inquiry made among the representatives of local expert groups rom seven towns and communes of the County. Because of the breach in systematically carried out researches, this paper is among the rare empirical scientific works on undevelope rural areas in Croatia made in the last ten years. The insight in developmental resources and factors and in development planning and organization is not possible without socia and above all, sociological researches. The price of this situation is known: for pure or no insight at all, developmental resources are being wasted and many actions aiming at revitalization of economically and demographically depressed regions have failed. The results of the research of perception of the way and extent the towns’ and communes’ belong to the County, of the judgement of developmental difficulties and priorities set by towns and communes as well as suggestions given by the participants of inquiry, are given in this paper by towns and communes. The author concludes with deduction and interpretation of common characteristics. First, because of the size and heterogeneity of the sparsely populated region {{and in the absence of}} a strong centre as well as because of the influence of Rijeka, Zagreb and Split macroregions, the cohesion of Licko-senjska County is very poor and the question of its identity is still open. Second, this County undoubtedly belongs to Croatian periphery with prevailing rural communities in all its communes and in small undeveloped towns without motivation for setting development in motion.

40|$|Background: People {{with disabilities}} in <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> of South Africa {{struggle}} to access healthcare, despite the right to health established by the Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Health system challenges and structural conditions of poverty impact this group in specific ways, with implications for households and communities that are not well understood. To date, health systems research and design have largely omitted disability considerations. Primary health care (PHC) calls for community engagement with health systems, to voice local needs, influence service provision, and hold providers to account. However, current models of community engagement rely on certain political, social and economic conditions, which are not present for rural people {{with disabilities in}} South Africa. Purpose: This study sought to understand the existing engagement between rural people with disabilities and healthcare workers in the PHC interface, and thus to theorise how this could be strengthened for more responsive and equitable services...|$|R
40|$|HAT), or {{sleeping}} sickness, is a vector-borne disease caused by trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhode-siense) mainly affecting <b>impoverished</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in sub-Saharan Africa, where the health systems are weak. Over the last decade, {{the number of}} HAT cases has shown a decreasing trend {{as a result of}} coordinated control efforts [1]. This makes it possible to envisage the elimination of the disease, but a new approach to uphold current results is needed. Sustainability of the control efforts will require integration of control and surveillance activities within a rein-forced health system [2]. However, the complexity of the existing diagnostic tools is not compatible with prevailing condi-tions at basic health facilities in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> where the disease is endemic, which hinders the participation of the health system in the control and surveillance of the disease [3]. There is an urgent need for diagnostic tests that are reliable, cheap, and easy to perform at basic health services.
