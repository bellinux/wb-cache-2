50|$|Hemp juice {{made from}} {{industrial}} hemp is a drug-free, non-psychoactive juice pressed with {{pressure from the}} Cannabis sativa plant. The juice is obtained through a large-scale industrial cold-pressing procedure using the upper parts of the <b>hemp</b> <b>plant</b> {{as well as the}} leaves. This procedure clearly distinguishes hemp juice from other hemp products such as hemp oil, hemp sprouts or hemp milk, which are solely obtained through the seeds of the <b>hemp</b> <b>plant</b> as opposed to the green hemp leaves used for the juice. The hemp juice production therefore makes use of a valuable part of the industrial <b>hemp</b> <b>plant</b> which has previously been neglected and not been used but instead been left on the fields to decompose. In particular, hemp juice offers a base for a variety of drug-free products in the areas of nutrition, medicine, cosmetics, and relaxing beverages. Moreover, its full-bodied umami flavor offers the ability to enhance dishes and drinks in their specific flavor, especially sweet or savory and harmonizes tastes overall.|$|R
