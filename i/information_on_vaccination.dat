40|$|Extract] The NZVA and Companion Animal Society have {{received}} {{an increasing number}} of inquiries from boarding facility operators and, in particular, from AsureQuality Limited, which manages the Pet Boarding Approval Programme. There are two recurring issues. The first is a lack of appropriate <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccination</b> certificates, including animal/owner details and revaccination dates. The second is confusion about revaccination interval recommendations by some veterinarians, which may differ from many boarding facilities' long-standing protocols...|$|E
50|$|In these studies, data <b>on</b> {{childhood}} <b>vaccinations</b> {{were typically}} collected in periodic surveys, and the <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> which occurred between successive home visits, was updated {{at the time}} of the second visit. The person-time at risk in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children - thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{economic}} {{analysis of the}} individual behaviour as regards vaccination extending the one carried out by Geoffard et Philipson [1997] in two directions: the ability of individuals to perform rational expectations and the updating of individual perceptions {{of the value of}} vaccination following information received. This last element is modelled through a Bayesian approach. These extensions allow, at first, to determine if Geoffard and Philipson [1997] conclusions on the difficulties raised by the eradication of a disease through vaccination are robust to the modification of assumptions on individual behaviour. Furthermore, the bayesian approach make able to discuss the role of <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccination</b> diffusion. Finally, this Bayesian approach also leads to diffusion curves for vaccination similar to those observed. This result allows to envisage a synthesis between epidemiological and economic models focused on infectious diseases when vaccination is available. ...|$|E

40|$|Increasing 2 -dose {{vaccination}} coverage {{has led to}} an interruption of endemic measles virus circulation in Germany. However, outbreaks after virus importation still occur and contribute to international transmission chains. Between 2003 and 2009, annual measles incidence ranged between 0. 2 and 2. 8 per 100, 000 population. Immunization gaps have been identified especially in secondary-school students and young adults, which is also reflected by a shift in age distribution of reported measles cases toward older age groups. Stronger political commitment and standardized guidelines for outbreak containment were put in place in Germany in the past years, but the last step toward measles elimination cannot be made until the number of susceptible individuals has been further reduced.

40|$|Vaccination decisions, as in {{choosing}} {{whether or not}} to immunize one 2 ̆ 7 s small child against specific diseases, are both psychologically and computationally complex. The psychological complexities have been extensively studied, often in the context of shaping convincing or persuasive messages that will encourage parents to vaccinate their children.

However, even if the parent has access to neutral, accurate, credible <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccination</b> risks and benefits, he or she can easily be overwhelmed by the task of combining this information into a well-reasoned decision. We argue here that the Internet, in addition to its potential as an information source, could provide useful assistance to parents in integrating factual information with their own values and preferences – that is, in providing real decision aid as well as information aid.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the uptake of 2009 [*]A/H 1 N 1 influenza vaccination among {{pregnant women and}} determine if vaccination was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A historical cohort study was performed using booking, delivery suite and neonatal unit discharge records from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Singleton deliveries to women pregnant before (December 2008 -September 2009) and during the pandemic (December 2009 -September 2010) were included. <b>Information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccination</b> status and type of vaccine was collected on admission to the delivery suite. Logistic regression analyses {{were used to determine}} maternal characteristics associated with vaccination. Pregnancy outcomes were compared for vaccinated and unvaccinated women, with adjustment for differing maternal characteristics. Outcomes included vaccination status, preterm birth, size for gestational age, neonatal intensive care admission, congenital anomalies and perinatal death. RESULTS: Of 6894 women pregnant during the pandemic, 2996 [43. 5 %] reported vaccination at delivery. In the early weeks of the vaccination programme rates of over 70 % were achieved. Of those vaccinated, 246 [8. 2 %], 1709 [57. 0 %] and 1034 [34. 5 %] were vaccinated in the first, second and third trimesters respectively. Vaccination was less likely in younger age groups, those who were not in the professional/manager/employer socioeconomic group, women from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia/Middle East, those who reported an unplanned pregnancy, women who booked late for antenatal care and recipients of publicly-funded obstetric care. Irish nationality was associated with reporting vaccination. There was no association between vaccination during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women who were vaccinated were less likely to have a preterm delivery than unvaccinated women.

This fact stems from unawareness of a significant progress achieved in the field of immunology in recent decades. Main findings: My bachelor thesis deals with vaccination in an early childhood. I tried to create an overview of compulsory as well as voluntary vaccination in certain periods of childhood and I also mention immunological aspects of vaccination. I briefly characterize selected contagious diseases and I present options of their prevention by utilizing vaccination. Furthermore, I present some child practitioners' opinions of vaccination as such. The thesis provides a general overview and comparison of history of vaccination in the Czech Republic and in the world in general.

40|$|Introduction. Sickle Cell Disease is {{a chronic}} disease with acute complications. Emergency Department visits and admissions are less {{frequent}} {{in areas of}} neonatal screening and comprehensive care. Italy is facing an increase in immigration {{with an increase in}} Sickle Cell patients. A neonatal screening programme is lacking and comprehensive care programmes are starting. Health operators are not familiar with this emerging disease. Objectives. To evaluate: rate and pattern of Emergency Department access by Sickle Cell children; accuracy of clinical approach by Emergency Department personnel; factors associated with admission. Methods. A retrospective analysis of Paediatric Emergency Department clinical records of Sickle Cell children from 1999 to 2006. Results. Overall 69 were Emergency Department visits for 14 children. Mean visits/child were 5 (range: 1 - 8). Mean age at first visit was 34 months (range: 1 - 194). All were immigrants (93 % African). 60 % had first diagnosis of Sickle Cell in the Emergency Department. Main reasons of access were fever (64 %) and pain (40 %). Only 5 / 69 visits had <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>vaccinations,</b> 17 / 69 on antibiotic prophylaxis, 4 / 69 on folic acid. Rate of admission was 61 %, mean length of stay was 4. 7 days. Main diagnosis at discharge was: vaso-occlusive crisis (29 %), respiratory infection (25 %), haemolysis (20 %). Factors associated with admission were (p < 0. 05) : fever, pain, older age, high C-reactive protein. Conclusions. The Emergency Department is a frequent site of first diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease; age at diagnosis and rate of admission are high. Approach to the disease by Health personnel can be improved...|$|R
