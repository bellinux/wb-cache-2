500|$|Described as Andrew Schwab's opus {{the record}} {{promises}} to be a fresh take on the P86 sound. Schwab said, [...] "On this record I was really able to take the reins of the creative process in a direction I was passionate about. I was able to write songs that pushed me to grow as an artist. It was also insanely fun to have so many of my friends involved in the process and {{at this point in the}} game that is what <b>its</b> <b>about.</b> I am really looking forward to people hearing this album." [...] With concert goers noting the new energy of the songs and new band members Scott Davis on drums, Dustinn Lowry on guitar and Mikee [...] "Norman" [...] Williams on bass it seems P86 has benefited from a back to basics reinvention.|$|E
500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to Comfort in Sound, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. <b>Its</b> <b>about</b> pulling yourself out of a big hole".|$|E

2500|$|In the Islamic era, Ardashir's Testament {{was famous}} and is {{mentioned}} in many history and literature books.

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. <b>Its</b> <b>about</b> life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
