30|$|Postoperative {{surgical}} adhesions in abdominal and pelvic surgery {{can have}} a major impact on patient’s subsequent health [1]. These continue to be a significant cause of female infertility, bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, and difficulties at the time of reoperation [2]. Almost 90 % of abdominal adhesions seem to be due to surgical antecedents. Despite the development of many surgical techniques and the use of several products to prevent or minimize the formation of adhesions following surgery, at least, 50 % of patients still develop substantial adhesions [3]. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ability of a <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> on the reduction of peritoneal and uterine adhesions in a laparoscopic rat model. TachoSil®, a particularly promising hemostatic agent, is a bioabsorbable fibrinogen and thrombin-coated <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> manufactured by Nycomed Laboratory (Copenhagen, Denmark). We hypothesized that under conditions of inadequate hemostasis, it may contribute to decrease adhesion development in a laparoscopic rat model. TachoSil® may also prevent thermo-induced injuries on peritoneum and uterine parenchyma.|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} heavy coagulation disorders needs measures that minimize immediate and post-surgical hemorrhagic risk. Besides the subjects afflicted with constitutional coagulation pathologies such as haemophilia A, B, C, AB, Von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders and others, too many are the patients that need pharmacological therapy to impede the creation of intra-vascular coagula. Today, surgical treatment of these patients is possible {{with the use of}} human fibrin glue (Tissucol) that permits excellent surgical and post-surgical hemostasis without therapy suspension, independently of coagulation disorder. The {{purpose of this study is}} a clinical evaluation of a surgical procedure based on the use of human fibrin glue in association or not with suture, <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> and lyophilized dura mater in patients with coagulation disorders. In a group of 309 patients in oral anticoagulant therapy have been done a total of 822 operations such as root fragments extraction with mucoperiosteal flap elevation, teeth or roots simple extractions, third molar extractions, cyst removal, apicoectomies. Only patients with PA over 20 % have been treated. All the operations have been leaded with minimal trauma; after the extractions, alveolar margins have been regularized to improve flaps adaptation. <b>Hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> or dura mater have been used like basis for the flaps and the fibrin glue, that was injected in the residual cavity after surgical suture. In a few cases, for example with little extraction wounds, only fibrin flue without suture or sponge has been used. In all cases and after all operations, the presence or absence of bleeding has been evaluated after 2 hours, 24 hours, 7 days after surgery. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Chitin and sepia ink hybrid <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> (CTSH sponge), a new {{biomedical}} material, was extensively {{studied for}} its beneﬁcial biological properties of hemostasis and stimulation of healing. However, studies examining {{the safety of}} CTSH sponge in the blood system are lacking. This experiment aimed to examine whether CTSH sponge has negative effect on blood systems of mice, which were treated with a dosage of CTSH sponge (135 mg/kg) through a laparotomy. CTSH sponge was implanted into the abdominal subcutaneous and a laparotomy was used for blood sampling from abdominal aortic. Several kinds of blood parameters were detected at different time points, which were reflected by coagulation parameters including thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplatin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB) and platelet factor 4 (PF 4); anticoagulation parameter including antithrombin III (AT-III); fibrinolytic parameters including plasminogen (PLG), fibrin degradation product (FDP) and D-dimer; hemorheology parameters including blood viscosity (BV) and plasma viscosity (PV). Results showed that CTSH sponge has no {{significant effect on the}} blood parameters of mice. The data suggested that CTSH sponge can be applied in the ﬁeld of biomedical materials and has potential possibility to be developed into clinical drugs of hemostatic agents...|$|E

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra demonstrated that the chemical compositions of CS and poly-(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (PVM/MA) were not altered during the phase inversion process. The morphology {{and structure of the}} sponge after the supercritical fluid (SCF) process were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponges</b> showed a relatively high porosity (about 80 %) with a controllable pore size ranging from 0. 1 to 200 µm. The concentration of PVM/MA had no significant influence on the porosity of the sponges. Comparative experiments on biological assessment and hemostatic effect between the resulting sponges and Avitene® were also carried out. With the incorporation of PVM/MA into the CS-based sponges, the water absorption rate of the sponges increased significantly, and the CS-PVM/MA sponges showed a similar water absorption rate (about 90 %) to that of Avitene®. The results of the whole blood clotting experiment and animal experiment also demonstrated that the clotting ability of the CS-PVM/MA sponges was similar to that of Avitene®. All these results elementarily verified that the sponges prepared in this study were suitable for hemostasis and demonstrated the feasibility of using SCF-assisted phase inversion technology to produce <b>hemostatic</b> porous <b>sponges...</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial {{management}} {{consists of}} immediate blood transfusion {{if the patient}} is in hemorrhagic shock. Classically, hemoperitoneum was an indication for emergency surgery to locate the source of bleeding and also to recover spilled blood from the peritoneal cavity and {{to use it for}} auto-transfusion if it has not been contaminated by ruptured bowel contents. The method of control depends on the source of blood loss. Vascular bleeding, i.e. from a blood vessel, would be treated by clamping and ligation of the offending vessel, or repair of the vessel in the case of major arteries such as the aorta or mesenteric arteries. Bleeding from the spleen most often requires splenectomy, or removal of the spleen, usually but not always {{in the form of a}} total splenectomy. Bleeding from the liver might be controlled by application of <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponges,</b> thrombin, or more recently, argon beam cauterization.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a fibrinogen and thrombin-coated <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> (TachoSil®) in the prevention of postsurgical adhesions in a laparoscopic rat model and its histological effects on uterine and peritoneal parenchyma. Design was a prospective randomized blinded study. Setting was in International Laparoscopic Surgery Centre, Clermont-Ferrand, France. There were 100 sexually mature female Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 240 to 300  g and aged 6 – 8  weeks. A standardized severe surgical injury induced by scissors and 40 -W bipolar coagulation in the rat uterine horn, corpus, and peritoneum was performed to induce adhesion formation. After trauma, group 1 (n[*]=[*] 50) received no treatment and group 2 rats (n[*]=[*] 50) received TachoSil® applied on injured areas. Twelve weeks after the procedure, repeat laparoscopy was performed and adhesions were scored according to their extent and severity. A hysterectomy and a peritoneal biopsy in the injured area were achieved by laparotomy in order to investigate on a possible earlier effect of TachoSil® on the uterine and peritoneal parenchyma in 49 rats of each group. TachoSil® group adhesion scores showed a significant decrease on the three injured areas: peritoneum (12.96 vs. 21.66), uterine horn (7.22 vs. 15.20), and uterine corpus (5.88 vs. 34.52). TachoSil® group also demonstrated a major decline of uterine fibrosis and inflammation. This study revealed that TachoSil®, an absorbable biomaterial, can reduce postoperative adhesions after laparoscopic surgery on a rat model. TachoSil® also prevents thermo-induced injuries on uterine parenchyma (less fibrosis and less inflammation).|$|E
40|$|The current {{approach}} for tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet treatment requires {{the use of}} local hemostatic agents without previous thromboembolic treatment interruption. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of an extra-alveolar hemostatic agent, the HemCon Dental Dressing (HDD), in controlling postsurgical bleeding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routine, atraumatic tooth extractions were performed in a single session under local anesthesia without a vasoconstrictor and without interruption of antiplatelet therapy. All patients underwent extraction of 2 teeth in the same session, with each in a different dental hemi-arch, and the hemostatic method to be used was randomly chosen: in the test site, the HDD was applied, whereas in the control site, a common <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge</b> (CollaPlug, Zimmer Dental) was applied and stabilized in situ with a suture. For each surgery, 2 different times were measured: the time required for hemostatic agent application and the time required for hemostasis achievement. Postoperative pain and healing quality also were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty outpatients were enrolled. The mean application time was considerably shorter in the test group than in the control group; the mean bleeding time in the control group was considerably shorter than in the test group; pain values were lower in the test group than in the control group, especially at suture removal; and postextraction socket healing was better in the test group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: HDD seems to be a valid and safe alternative in treating postextraction sockets in outpatients under single-drug antiplatelet treatment in the absence of surgical wound lacerations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of TachoSil® (Nycomed UK, Oxford, Buckinghamshire, UK), a <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponge,</b> to seal major collecting system injuries (in addition to providing an adjunct to hemostasis) after partial nephrectomy in a porcine chronic survival model. Materials and Methods: Laparoscopic upper-pole partial nephrectomies were performed in 10 farm pigs (> 40 kg). After hilar clamping, an energyless incision was made at a point halfway between the hilum and the upper pole of the kidney and the collecting system was opened widely. TachoSil was applied to cover the defect; 15 to 20 minutes after the application of TachoSil, the hilar clamp was removed, hemostasis confirmed, and the pig survived. Assessment was made for hematoma and urinoma. Four weeks postoperatively, the pigs were euthanized. Ex-vivo retrograde studies were performed to assess collecting system leak. Weight, blood pressure, estimated blood loss, the weight of the partial and completion nephrectomy specimen, presence/absence of urinary leak on retrograde study, histopathologic findings, and complications were recorded. Results: All pigs survived. Mean warm ischemia time was 18 minutes, mean blood loss was 90 mL, and mean resected weight was 13. 7 g. There was no evidence of leak on retrograde study. Histologically, nonspecific changes were noted in all specimens, which included dystrophic calcification, scarring, and areas of fibrosis at the partial nephrectomy surgical margin. Conclusion: TachoSil seals the collecting system after partial nephrectomy on a porcine chronic survival model, in addition to providing an adjunct to hemostasis. More studies, including human trials, are warranted to evaluate this observation further. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc [...] Articl...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} effect of {{polysaccharide}} <b>hemostatic</b> healing <b>sponge</b> in controlling bleeding from femoral artery in miniature swines. Methods　Thirty two miniature pigs were used to reproduce femoral artery hemorrhage model and then divided equally into four groups, and bleeding from femoral artery was treated by Medical Polysaccharide <b>Hemostatic</b> Healing <b>Sponge</b> (MP), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), gelatin sponge (GS) or medical gauze (MG), respectively. Hemostasis time, blood loss and vital signs of these pigs were observed and recorded. Results　There were no group differences in mean arterial pressure. Hemostasis time was earlier and blood loss was less in MP, CMC and GS groups than in MG group, and the hemostatic effect was superior in CMC group to MP and GS groups and similar between the MP and GS groups. Conclusion　MP or CMC dressing could effectively stop femoral artery bleeding, and its hemostatic effect is similar to or slightly better than GS in miniature pigs.

The main aim {{of this research was}} to address problems such as bleeding, systemic chemotherapy side effects while enhancing quality of life, and increasing drug concentrations at the tumor site by developing a novel formulation with local long-term efficacy for treatment of tumors and to stop bleeding. Methods: 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) was suspended in an ethyl acetate solution of poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and a vacuum drying method was applied. The <b>hemostatic</b> gelatin <b>sponge</b> loaded with 5 -FU was prepared by absorption of the suspension. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the <b>hemostatic</b> gelatin <b>sponge</b> loaded with 5 -FU (5 -FU-HAGS) were investigated. Results: 5 -FU-HAGS (<b>hemostatic</b> absorbable gelatin <b>sponge</b> loaded with 5 -fluorouracil) was successfully produced with controlled release of the content and was reproducibly suitable for local tumor treatment as an implant to stop bleeding. The encapsulation efficiency of 5 -FU-HAGS was above 98 %. The in vitro 5 -FU release kinetic profile matched a near zero-order equation for 20 days. The in vivo 5 -FU plasma concentration was at a more stable level than when 5 -FU solution was administered by subcutaneous injection. Bleeding can be stopped more effectively by coating a piece of blank gelatin sponge. The survival ratio of tumor-bearing mice using a 5 -FU-HAGS subcutaneous implant was higher when compared to mice given a subcutaneous injection of 5 -FU solution. Conclusion: The 5 -FU-HAGS system is a potential and effective way of enhancing the survival ratio and improving {{the quality of life of}} tumor-bearing mice.

40|$|SummaryWe {{report the}} case of a 23 -year-old female who {{underwent}} balloon mitral valvotomy for severe symptomatic mitral stenosis. Following septal puncture, the patient developed cardiac tamponade, which warranted sternotomy to suture the rent in the inferior vena cava–right atrial junction. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed nonhomogenous irregular opacities within the left atrium suggesting the possibility of thrombus formation. As the patient was in sinus rhythm and peri-procedural activated clotting time was in therapeutic range, clot formation was unlikely. A review of operative notes revealed placement of absorbable <b>hemostatic</b> gelatin <b>sponge</b> within the pericardium, which was mimicking left atrial clot. This potential pitfall has to be recognized in echocardiograms, as it will avoid inappropriate anticoagulant therapy...|$|R

In the present report, the leaves of a geraniaceae (Pelargonium zonale) were tested on a bleeding rat model. The bleeding time was 50 % shorter in the geranium leaf juice treatment group (18. 10 ± 2. 03 min) and 80 % shorter in the geranium crushed-leaf group (7. 10 ± 0. 88 min) than in the control (nontreatment) group (37. 6 ± 3. 04 min),p< 0. 0001. Bleeding time with guava (Psidium guajava) crushed leaves (39. 90 ± 1. 54 min) was not different from the control group.

We reviewed and outlined the historical progress of topical hemostats into present day surgery and urology, and highlight opportunities for future research. Materials and Methods : A MEDLINE search of all available literature concerning several classes of topical hemostatic agents was performed. Fibrins sealants, Gelatin <b>sponge</b> <b>hemostatics,</b> cyanoacrylate adhesives, oxidized regenerated cellulose, and microfibrillar collagen were included. References were chosen from a broad range of surgical literature. Results : Topical hemostatic agents have historically taken advantage of a wide variety of mechanisms for hemostasis.

40|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{the gold}} standard treatment for patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Brazilian Registry of Transplantation revealed that liver transplantation was the second solid organ most transplanted in 2010. With the purpose to eliminate foci of infection and {{reduce the risk of}} infection on the postransplant stage, these patients should undergo dental treatment to the removal of dental foci, with special care regarding the hemostasis impairment, mainly related to a reduced hepatic synthesis of procoagulants factors and thrombocytopenia. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative bleeding after dental extraction in candidates for liver transplantation. In this study, 23 patients were included {{with a mean age of}} 43. 17 Â 14. 62 years, with a higher prevalence of whites (82. 6 %) and men (60. 9 %). In 23 patients, 84 simple extractions were performed in 35 dental surgical procedures. Patients were divided in two groups to compare two local hemostatic measures after tooth extraction: in group 1, local pressure after sutures was applied with gauze soaked with tranexamic acid, and in group 2, the same procedure without the tranexamic acid was performed. In all subjects, absorbable <b>hemostatic</b> <b>sponges</b> and cross sutures were used as a standard hemostatic measure. The main preoperative blood tests found were: mean hematocrit of 34. 54 % (SD Â 5. 84 %, range 21. 7 % â 44. 4 %), platelets ranged from 31, 000 /mm 3 to 160, 000 /mm 3, mean international normalized ratio (INR) was 1. 50 (SD Â 0. 39; range 0. 98 - 2. 59). Postoperative bleeding occurred in only one procedure (2. 9 %) and local pressure with gauze was effective to achieve hemostasis. Thus, this paper demonstrates the possibility of performing tooth extractions in patients with liver cirrhosis, with INR &# 8804; 2. 50 and platelets &# 8805; 30, 000 /mm 3, without the need of blood transfusion, and in case of bleeding events, the use of local hemostatic measures can be satisfactory.

Nos 23 pacientes, 84 exodontias simples foram realizadas em 35 procedimentos cirÃrgicos. Os pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos para comparaÃÃo de duas medidas hemostÃticas locais apÃs as exodontias: no grupo 1, aplicou-se pressÃo local com gaze embebida em Ãcido tranexÃmico, e no grupo 2, realizou-se a mesma conduta sem o uso do referido Ãcido. Em todos os pacientes foram utilizadas a esponja de colÃgeno reabsorvÃvel e sutura em X como medida hemostÃtica padrÃo. Os valores encontrados para os exames hematolÃgicos foram: hematÃcrito mÃdio de 34, 54 Â 5, 84 % (intervalo de 21, 7 % â 44, 4 %), plaquetometria variou de 31. 000 /mm 3 a 160. 000 /mm 3 e o Ãndice mÃdio encontrado para a razÃo internacional normatizada (INR) foi 1, 50 Â 0, 39 (intervalo de 0, 98 â 2, 59). Sangramento pÃs-operatÃrio ocorreu apenas em um procedimento (2, 9 %) e a pressÃo local com gaze foi eficaz em parar o episÃdio de hemorragia. Dessa forma, esse trabalho demonstra a possibilidade da realizaÃÃo de exodontias em pacientes com cirrose hepÃtica com valores de INR &# 8804; 2, 50 e plaquetometria &# 8805; 30. 000 /mm 3 sem a necessidade de transfusÃo sanguÃnea e que diante da ocorrÃncia de intercorrÃncias hemorrÃgicas, o uso de medidas hemostÃticas locais pode ser satisfatÃrio...|$|R
