It also implies that the formation of free particles of silica or titania is negligible in the second reactor.

Creep {{damage of}} {{pressure}} equipment involves {{a great variety}} of high temperature components ranging from superheaters, reheaters, <b>furnaces,</b> <b>reactors,</b> etc [...] Consequence of failures of these components are of high economic and safety concern. Moreover, the probability of failure of high temperature components is now increasing due to frequent cyclic of power plants imposed by a deregulated market and the search for increasing temperatures in ultrasupercritical plants. In this scenario, a complete NDT campaign is necessary both during the design stage and during the in-service stage. The choice of the specific NDT tecnique for each component type is of great importance. In this work an overview of the existing NDT techniques for creep designed and operated components are presented. Together with metallographic replica, which is still considered the fundamental tool for creep damage assessment in the majority of materials, other NDT tecniques which are able to detect creep cavity or cracks are presented and compared: ultrasonic techniques (tofd and phased-arrays), acoustic emission, holographic interferometry. In the second part of this paper the ability of some NDT tools to support residual life assessments are discussed. Among the most interesting tools are oxide scale ultrasonic measurement, micro-hardness testing, small-punch testing and on-stream deformation measurement. This tools are not strictly devoted to detecting creep defects (such as microcavities or microcracks) rather they give useful information related to creep damage, such as component deformation, material degradation and maximum service temperature.

Ni/Al 2 O 3 (CAT- 1), Ni–Co/Al 2 O 3 (CAT- 2) and Ni–Co/Al 2 O 3 –MgO (CAT- 3) nanocatalysts were synthesized by sol–gel method with citric acid as the gelling agent, and used in the dry reforming of methane (DRM). The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of Al 2 O 3 and MgO addition on the catalytic properties and the reaction performance of synthesized catalysts in the DRM reactions. The characteristics of the catalyst are studied using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, H 2 -temperature programmed reduction, CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption and temperature programmed oxidation analysis. The characteristics of the catalyst are dependent on the type of support, which influences the catalytic performances. FESEM analysis showed that CAT- 3 has irregular shape morphology, and is well dispersed onto the catalyst support. BET results demonstrate high surface area of the synthesized catalyst due to high calcination temperature during catalysts preparation. Moreover, the formation of MgAl 2 O 4 spinel-type solution in CAT- 3 is proved by XRD analysis due to the interaction between alumina lattice and magnesium metal which has high resistance to coke formation, leading to stronger metal surface interaction within the catalyst. The CO 2 methane dry reforming is executed in the tubular <b>furnace</b> <b>reactor</b> at 1073.15  K, 1  atm and CH 4 /CO 2 ratio of unity to investigate the effect of the mentioned catalysts.

40|$|Torrefaction enhances {{physical}} properties of lignocellulosic biomass and improves its grindability. Energy densification, via fuel pellets production, {{is one of}} the most promising uses of torrefaction. Lignin contributes to self-bonding of wood particles during pelletization. In biomass thermal pretreatment, part of lignin (in the form of lignin liquid intermediates – LLI) migrates from the cell wall and middle lamella and deposits on the fibers’ surfaces and/or inner surface of the secondary cell wall. This material can play an important role on bonding particles during wood pelletization as well as production of wood composites. The objective of this paper was to investigate the influence of torrefaction conditions on amount, composition, molecular weight, and pattern of deposition of LLI on wood cells. Torrefaction of extracted ponderosa pine in the range of temperatures 225 – 350 °C was conducted in a tube <b>furnace</b> <b>reactor</b> and the torrefied wood was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) to isolate the lignin-rich soluble material. A maximum yield of DCM-soluble material was observed in wood torrefied at approximately 300 °C for 30 min. ESI/MS revealed that the molecular weight of the removed material is less than 1200 g mol− 1 and decreases as torrefaction temperature augments. Semiquantitative Py-GC/MS of the DCM-soluble material suggests that this lignin-rich material migrates and deposits on cells’ surfaces in amounts that depend on the torrefaction conditions. Py-GC/MS of the solid fraction after the DCM process showed a progressive reduction of products of the pyrolysis of lignin and levoglucosan as torrefaction temperature increased, revealing that lignin content in the solid decreased due in part to migration. SEM of torrefied particles helped to show the apparent formation of LLI during torrefaction. Results suggest that it is possible to control the thermal pretreatment conditions to increase or reduce the amount of lignin-rich material on fiber surfaces as required for downstream processes (e. g., fuel pellets or wood composites manufacture).

40|$|Coal plays a {{dominating}} role in {{the primary}} energy in China which brings serious environmental problems during its utilization. Biomass is a renewable energy. But its utilization is easily limited by seasonal restriction and its own characteristics. The co-gasification of coal and biomass can improve the conversion efficiency of biomass and reduce the emissions of contaminants. Experimental studies on co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal were performed in the thermogravimetric analyzer and in the <b>furnace</b> <b>reactor.</b> The studies were focused on possible synergetic effects between biomass and coal. The synergetic effects were studied from the yield and component of the major prolysis products. The effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals on the biomass characteristics were also studied in the thermogravimetric analyzer. A new co-pyrolysis method was introduced to use coal and biomass. In a two-stage fixed bed, the cracking characteristics of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis in coal char were studied. The main conclusions are drawn as following: (1) The results in the thermogravimetric analyzer show that in co-pyrolysis progress, the biomass volatile releasing temperature increase with increasing amount of lignite in blends. Co-pyrolysis of coal and biomass produces more char than the summation of individual lignite and biomass pyrolysis. The synergistic effects in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal are suggested. The co-pyrolysis results of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin mixed with lignite show synergetic effects litte. The diameter of sample particle has no influence on the synergetic effects between biomass and coal. (2) The co-pyrolysis results of biomass and lignite in <b>furnace</b> <b>reactor</b> show that the yield of gas, liquid and char is coincide with the calculated value. But the content of H 2 in gas is lower {{and the content of}} CO and CO 2 is higher both in blends of RS/lignite and wood/lignite. The H 2 from wood/lignite blends was 5. 89 % lower than the calculated value at lignite content 50 % while CO was 4. 63 % higher. The C/H ratio of RS/lignite blends is much higher while that of wood/lignite blends is lower than expectation. Both the gas and char show synergetic effects obviously. The component of tar from blends of biomass and lignite is similar with the tar from biomass or lignite which showes additional effect only. (3) The pyrolysis results of microcrystalline cellulose (mcc) and biomass loaded K, Na, Mg, Ca investigated by thermogravimetric analysis with measurement of products by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (TG–FTIR) show that the catalytic effect of the metals added on the cellulose is K>Na>Mg>Ca. Potassium catalysed pyrolysis increase the char yields markedly, shift the pyrolysis process to lower temperature, and increase the light organic fraction in volatile components. The alkali metals can lower the average apparent first-order activation energy for pyrolysis. The catalysis of KCl and NaCl is relatively weak compared to KAc and NaAc. KAc and NaAc can prompt the pyrolysis of cellulose into light fractions at lower temperature, especially acids. In biomass, the organically bound alkali metals may catalyse pyrolysis of biomass more than the inorganically alkalis. (4) In a two-stage fixed bed, the cracking results of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis in a high temperature coal char show that both long residence time in char and the higher cracking temperature can decrease the tar yield with the increase of gas yield and H 2 percentage. The percentage of H 2 and CO can reach 94. 51 % at the craking temperature 1000 ℃. The prepare condition of char has influence on the gas yield and composition. Low pyrolysis temperature and short residence time can increase reactivity of coal char and is favor to the higher H 2 and CO percentage in gas. 煤炭是我国主要的化石能源，在一次能源中占主导地位，但其利用过程中排放的污染物带来了较严重的环境问题。生物质是一种清洁能源，但受到季节与自身特征的限制，其转化利用规模较小、转化效率较低。煤和生物质的共利用可以实现资源互补，提高生物质利用的转化效率、减少污染气体的排放。因此研究生物质与煤的共利用过程对于研究洁净煤技术以及污染物控制有着重要的意义。 本论文首先对煤与生物质直接混合后的共热解进行研究，在热天平反应装置和管式炉反应器中对反应特性进行分析，并对共热解过程中存在的协同效应的机理进行分析，探讨了碱/碱土元素在热解中所起的作用；最后采用一种新型共热解方式，在两段式热解炉中将生物质热解气通过灼热的煤焦层，煤焦催化裂解生物质焦油，并与气体发生气化反应转化为可燃气。经过试验，得到以下主要结论： （ 1 ）生物质与褐煤直接混合后共热解能促进固体焦产率的提高，热解过程中生物质挥发分析出温度段向高温段移动，煤析出向低温段移动。木屑与煤的共热解中起始温度tv比木屑单独热解高 10 ℃以上，协同效应最明显，生物质与煤混合后最大挥发分析出温度tmax均比单独热解高 3. 0 - 11. 8 ℃之间。说明生物质与煤共热解过程中存在协同作用。生物质中半纤维素、纤维素、木质素与褐煤共热解中热解产物分布基本与理论计算值相符，反应过程中协同效应不明显。 （ 2 ）在生物质与煤直接混合的管式炉热解实验中，对热解产物分析得到如下结论：生物质和褐煤混合热解产物分布与计算值一致，但共热解气体中H 2 的含量低于理论计算值，CO和CO 2 的实际含量略高于计算值，在煤含量为 50 %时，与计算值相比较，木屑/煤的热解气中H 2 的含量低 5. 89 %、CO高 4. 63 %，生物质与褐煤在共热解过程中发生了协同作用。稻秆与煤共热解焦中C/H比明显大于理论计算值，而木屑/煤混合热解焦的C/H比基本低于理论计算值。生物质与褐煤的共热解焦油组成基本上与单独热解焦油成份类似，协同效应不明显。 （ 3 ）添加到生物质中的四种金属元素对热解催化作用的顺序为：K> Na> Mg> Ca。碱金属能促进纤维素在较低温度下热解，能够降低纤维素的表观活化能，当纤维素中以KAc形式添加的K含量为 3. 57 %时，可使纤维素的起始热解温度降低约 115 ℃。碱金属添加量低时对纤维素热解几乎没有催化作用。碱金属存在形态对热解催化作用有影响，生物质中以有机结合态存在的碱金属对热解的催化能力大于以无机态存在的同种金属。KAc能够促进纤维素热解产物中小分子物质，尤其是羧酸类物质的生成。 （ 4 ）在两段式热解中对生物质煤焦进行分段共热解，生物质热解气经过灼热的煤焦后，气体中所携带的焦油被裂解为可燃气体。增加稻秆热解气在煤焦中的 停留时间及提高裂解温度，都有利于促进焦油裂解，高温也能促进煤焦的气化反应，使气体产率增加。裂解温度对出口端气体产率、组分影响更明显，在 1000 ℃时H 2 和CO的含量可以达到 94. 51 %。当稻秆热解气在煤焦中停留时间大于一定值后，气体中各组分和焦油裂解效率变化趋于平稳。不同热解条件所制煤焦对生物质热解气中所携带焦油裂解效果不同，降低制焦温度、缩热解时间都有利于增加煤焦的反应活性，促进焦油分解，使气体中H 2 和CO含量增加，CH 4 与CO 2 含量下降。减小煤焦颗粒直径可以增加焦油裂解率，但对气体组分影响不大...|$|E
40|$|Tubular <b>furnace</b> {{pyrolysis}} <b>reactor</b> for {{the production}} of organic liquids from biomass has been demonstrated at a pilot-scale of 500 g/batch of dry feed at a temperature of 360 - 420 degrees C. Treatment of starch gives high yields of 1, 6 -anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranose (levoglucosan, LG). The yield depends on the heater temperature and the vacuum pressure in the reactor. The maximum yield of levoglucosan from corn starch is about 56 % (analytical value) at ultimate pressure of 6 x 10 (- 2) Pa, pumping speed of 15 L/s and temperature of 390 degrees C. Under the same conditions, the products of levoglucosan pyrolysis are exactly the same as starch pyrolysis. Based on these experimental results and further thermal analysis, a new pyrolysis mechanism is provided and discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Any {{extraction}} process {{will include a}} sequence of steps or unit processes for separating highly pure metals from undesirables in an economically efficient system. Unit processes are usually broken down into three categories: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and electrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, the metal ore is first oxidized through roasting or smelting. The target metal is further refined at high temperatures and reduced to its pure form. In hydrometallurgy, the object metal is first dissociated from other materials using a chemical reaction, which is then extracted in pure form using electrolysis or precipitation. Finally, electrometallurgy generally involves electrolytic or electrothermal processing. The metal ore is either distilled in a electrolyte or acid solution, then magnetically deposited onto a cathode plate (electrowinning); or smelted then melted using an electric arc or plasma arc <b>furnace</b> (electrothermic <b>reactor).</b> Extractive metallurgy of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can involve pyrometallurgy, but chemical processes like hydrometallurgy and electrometallurgy are far more common in method of non-ferrous extraction.|$|R
