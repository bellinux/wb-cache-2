40|$|This study investigates three {{competing}} but complementary {{perspectives on}} {{factors related to}} entrepreneurial firm growth. We examine individual (entrepreneur) firm and national environment factors associated with the growth expectations of nascent, baby and established firms. Using 25, 384 data points from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) ’s survey of entrepreneurial activity in 35 countries, we find male gender, personal acquaintance with an entrepreneur, innovative product/service, low levels of competition and based in less-developed countries are associated with high growth expectations for all three business stages. Nascent and baby firms’ business growth expectations are also linked to having higher levels of start-up capital and outside investment. In contrast to some previous research, we find that a firm’s initial size is {{the best predictor of}} growth expectations. Altogether, size-related factors determine not only initial growth expectations, but also growth expectations at later firm stages. The law of disproportionate growth (i. e. a small number of firms are responsible for most <b>expected</b> <b>job</b> <b>creation)</b> holds for both start-ups and established businesses, although the latter are more rare. While both start-up and established firm growth expectations are higher in the developing countries, the fastest growing young firms are mainly found in developed countries.

40|$|Direct <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> {{programs}} were {{a key element}} of the Australian Commonwealth Government's response to the policy challenge of persistent, high unemployment between 1974 and the year 2000. The emergence of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs coincided with an evolving debate over the extent and legitimacy of the state's role in economic regulation, especially in relation to the labour market. Notwithstanding this coincidence, there has been no systematic effort to explore the purposes and nature of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs from a regulatory perspective. Using three case studies of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs implemented in Australia, this thesis tests propositions that are generated from regulatory theory, a field of scholarship broadly concerned with the relationship between the state, law and society. First, it was <b>expected</b> that <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs would serve a multiplicity of state objectives, including the immediate <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> goals of each program, {{as well as a number}} of broader labour market purposes. Second, it was anticipated that <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs would be implemented through a diverse range of economic and other non-legal regulatory strategies or instruments. Third, notwithstanding the broader regulatory character of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs, it was expected that the programs would be expressed and constrained by various legal measures performing important regulatory functions. Finally, it was expected that the case studies would reveal interaction or responsiveness between policy objectives and the different legal and non-legal elements of each program. It is found that these propositions are largely borne out in the context of <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs. The immediate <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> objectives of each program were to assist people who were unemployed and considered to be disadvantaged in the labour market to obtain at least temporary employment positions. It is demonstrated that these immediate objectives reflected broader goals, such as the desire of the Commonwealth to redistribute employment opportunities to those people otherwise excluded from labour market participation. The Commonwealth Government relied upon a diverse range of regulatory instruments to achieve these goals, including financial subsidies or incentives to non-government employers, and contracting out of certain services, each supported by public sector management and oversight. Notwithstanding that these regulatory strategies were largely non-legal in nature, it is revealed that legal measures such as policy guidelines and contracts were used to ensure that regulated actors were accountable to the goals of each program. It is concluded that there was a significant degree of interaction between legal and non-legal forms of regulation in the context of these <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> programs. The findings in this thesis are significant for a number of reasons. Most importantly, this thesis establishes that <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> {{programs were}} significant state regulatory initiatives. This contradicts any notion of the state playing a lesser or somehow insubstantial role in labour market formation and regulation during the period studied. These findings have important implications for future studies of the <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> function of the-state, and point to new and potentially more insightful ways of theorising the relationship between the state and the labour market in Australia.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a model {{according to which}} the costs of business cycles are nontrivial because they reduce the average level of output. The reason is an interaction between <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> costs and an agency problem. The agency problem triggers separations during economic downturns even though both the employer and the worker {{would be better off}} if the job was not discontinued, that is, affected jobs have strictly positive surplus values. Similarly, booms make it possible for more jobs to overcome the agency problem. These effects do not offset each other, because business cycles reduce the <b>expected</b> <b>job</b> duration for these jobs. With positive <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> costs, business cycles then reduce the <b>creation</b> of valuable <b>jobs</b> and lower average activity levels.

30|$|The {{preceding}} discussion {{suggests that}} a labor demand model needs to account for export orientation and import competition. An increase in the revenue share of export firms could reduce employment growth as in the Helpman et al. (2010) and Davis and Harringa (2011) models, or it may lead to employment growth as in Felbermayr et al. (2011 a). Since the risk of firm exit declines with firm size and productivity (Bernard and Jensen 1999), one would also <b>expect</b> <b>jobs</b> in exporter firms to be relatively more stable. It is therefore possible that as an industry gets increasingly export oriented, employment becomes more secure while <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> rates may slowdown. Although trade theories with heterogeneous firms typically assume firm productivity to be a random draw from a Pareto distribution, in practice, exporter firms would engage in long-term productivity enhancing activities such as innovation, training of workers, and investment in the latest machinery and equipment—interventions that are more frequent among large firms (Revenga 1997). The resulting productivity gains, including those from learning-through-exporting, may allow exporters to increase output with limited <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> The effect on net employment thus becomes an empirical question.|$|R

Specifically, the study investigated to what extent JCT had achieved its goal of <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> Further, the study explored the type and sustainability of the jobs created and the implications that the findings have pertaining {{to the role of}} trade unions in <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> An examination of literature revealed that there are three main ways in which trade unions can participate in <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> Firstly, trade unions can get involved in <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> by influencing macro-economic and social policies at multipartite structures. Secondly, trade unions can intervene in <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> by facilitating skills development. Finally, trade unions can create jobs directly as illustrated by the MineWorkers Development Agency and the <b>Job</b> <b>Creation</b> Trust. Further, literature shows that the active involvement of trade unions in <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, from as early as the early 1900 s, trade unions expanded their role of collective bargaining to include controlling the supply of labour and facilitating skills development. The main focus of the study is on the role of trade unions in direct <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> After a thorough investigation on the experience of trade unions in direct <b>job</b> <b>creation</b> (using JCT as a case study), the study concludes that trade unions {{have a role to play}} in <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> The study argues that trade unions should focus on influencing macro-economic policies and facilitating skills development as compared to being involved in direct <b>job</b> <b>creation.</b> This is based on many challenges that not only undermine trade union’s ability to create jobs, but also on the challenges that face the model of projects funded by the JCT. Accordingly, the study makes the following recommendations that specifically try to address the challenges identified. Firstly, JCT can continue funding rural micro and small enterprises. Such a route requires close monitoring of the projects to mitigate the challenges that such projects fail and, ultimately lead to failure of project. Secondly, JCT can adopt the role of a labour market intermediary in which it would be involved in recruiting among the unemployed, facilitating training and placement. Finally, JCT can adopt the Basic Income Grant (BIG) and work with other stakeholders such as governments, faith based organisations and NGOs.
