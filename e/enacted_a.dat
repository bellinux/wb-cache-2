5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E
5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune.

In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison.

5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether.

The government <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took advantage of this program.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period. Despite this, {{the gross domestic}} product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999.

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} {{constitutional}} {{reforms in the}} 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} attack on Ancona, the Austro-Hungarian battleships were {{confined}} to Pola {{for the duration of}} the war. Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast. Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff-class battleships, the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro-Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being. This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait. With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea, and with a shortage of coal, Haus <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E

5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, {{the result of}} the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.|$|E
5|$|Combs first {{attempted}} to gain legislative concessions that might preclude {{the need for}} a lawsuit. Governor Martha Layne Collins proposed an education reform agenda and called the legislature into special session in mid-1985 to consider it. The legislature <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> corporate income tax to raise $300million aimed at reducing class sizes, but the Council was seeking more fundamental structural changes to the system and deemed the increased funds insufficient to equalize its members' standing with that of more affluent school districts. Dissatisfied with the results of the special session, Combs and the Council filed their suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, on November 20, 1985. The governor, state superintendent, state treasurer, leaders of both houses of the state legislature, and every member of {{the state board of education}} were named as defendants in the case.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some {{evidence}} to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone <b>enacted</b> <b>a</b> code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E
