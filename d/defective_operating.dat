40|$|Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{represent}} an affordable and robust driveline solution {{but the quality}} of the vehicle propulsion perceived by the driveris largely dependent on {{the quality of the}} control strategies. This paper aims at investigating the engagement performance of actuated dry clutch in AMTs by taking into account a more detailed frictional characteristic identified through specific tribological test patterns. The outcome of this analysis provides information for designers of automated clutches to overcome poor engagement performances due to <b>defective</b> prediction of <b>operating</b> condition variables as contact pressure, sliding speed and temperature influence on the frictional behaviour of facing materials...|$|R
40|$|Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) have mild defects in dental enamel. The gene mutated {{in these patients}} is CFTR, a Cl− channel involved in transepithelial salt and water transport and bicarbonate secretion. We tested the hypothesis that Cftr channels are present and operating in the plasma membranes of mouse ameloblasts. Tissue sections of young mouse jaws and fetal human jaws were immunostained with various anti-Cftr antibodies. Specificity of the antibodies was validated in Cftr-deficient murine and human tissues. Immunostaining for Cftr was obtained in the apical plasma membranes of mouse maturation ameloblasts of both incisor and molar tooth germs. A granular intracellular immunostaining of variable intensity was also noted in bone cells and odontoblasts. In Cftr-deficient mice the incisors were chalky white and eroded much faster than in wild type mice. Histologically, only maturation ameloblasts of incisors were structurally affected in Cftr-deficient mice. Some antibody species gave also a positive cytosolic staining in Cftr-deficient cells. Transcripts of Cftr were found in maturation ameloblasts, odontoblasts and bone cells. Similar data were obtained in forming human dentin and bone. We conclude that Cftr protein locates in the apical plasma membranes of mouse maturation ameloblasts. In mouse incisors Cftr is critical for completion of enamel mineralization and conceivably functions as a regulator of pH during rapid crystal growth. Osteopenia found in CF patients {{as well as in}} Cftr-deficient mice is likely associated with <b>defective</b> Cftr <b>operating</b> in bone cells...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a hybrid maintenance policy {{for a simple}} system comprising a single component that arises from a heterogeneous population. This population of components consists of two sub-populations that possess different failure characteristics. There are {{a substantial number of}} papers that deal with appropriate mixture distributions for the lifetime of a component from such a population. However, the study of maintenance policies for a system with this type of component is limited. By supposing that a component may be in a <b>defective</b> but <b>operating</b> state, so that there exists a delay time between defect arrival and failure, we consider a novel maintenance policy that is a hybrid of inspection and replacement policies. There are similarities in this approach with the concept of “burn-in” maintenance. The policies are investigated in the context of traction motor bearing failures. Under certain circumstances, particularly when the mixture parameter is large and the distribution of lifetimes for the two component types are well separated, the hybrid policy has significant cost savings over the standard age-based replacement policy and over the pure inspection policy. In addition to the cost metric, the mean time between operational failures of the system under the hybrid policy can be used to guide decision-making. This maintenance policy metric is calculated using simulation, and using an approximation which assumes that operational failures occur according to a Poisson process with a rate that can be calculated in a straightforward way. The simulation and approximation results show good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Open accessThis article {{analyzes}} {{the processes of}} dehumanization {{that occurred in the}} Michener Center, a total institution for the purported care and training of people deemed to be mental <b>defectives</b> 1 that <b>operated</b> in Alberta, Canada. I report on qualitative interviews with 22 survivors, three ex-workers, and the institutional archival record, drawing out the ways that dehumanization was accomplished through bodily means and the construction of embodied otherness along several axes. First, inmates’ bodies were erased or debased as unruly matter out of place that disturbed the order of rational modernity, a move that meant inmates were not seen as deserving or even requiring of normal human consideration. Spatial practices within the institution included panopticism and isolation, constructing inmates as not only docile but as unworthy of contact and interaction. Dehumanization was also seen as necessary to and facilitative of patient care; to produce inmates as subhuman permitted efficiency, but also neglect and abuse. Finally, practices of hygiene and sequestering the polluting bodies of those deemed mentally defective sustained and justified dehumanization. These practices had profound effects for inmates and also for those charged with caring for them. Ye...|$|R
40|$|A defect {{can escape}} {{detection}} either because (1) the test patterns applied do not expose {{the effects of}} the defect, or (2) the defect does not interfere with correct operation at the operating conditions of the tests. Incomplete Tests The first case occurs when the test patterns are not thorough enough, but it may be very difficult to determine how thorough the test patterns really are. As an example, let's consider testing of a combinational circuit — perhaps as part of an internal scan test. Further, suppose that the part was not to be operated at an aggressive speed so that delay fault testing was not necessary assuming that process drift was checked by some other means such as ring oscillators, etc. If we had generated a test set that had 100 % single stuck fault coverage we would be confident that we were applying a very thorough test. Hidden in this confidence is the belief that the defects would not change the combinational circuit into a sequential circuit. How could this happen? One possibility is that a defect caused a bridging fault that inserted an asynchronous feedback loop into the circuit. Another, and probably much more likely explanation, is that a defect caused an open in the circuit. In our Murphy experiment [1], we found that 36 of the 116 defective chips exhibited sequence dependent behavior; that is, their output response changed if the order in which the inputs were applied was changed. One might think that the way to avoid this situation would be to apply a stuck-open test set; but in our experiment the stuck-open test set was very long and still missed many of the defective chips. There were several multiple-detect test sets that were shorter than the stuck-open test set and which detected all of the <b>defective</b> chips. <b>Operating</b> Conditions Dependence The second case in which the chip operates correctly for the specified operating conditions is one in which the defect is present but is not serious enough to interfere with correct operation. Such a defect i...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} patient PB, who, after an {{electric}} shock {{that led to}} vascular insufficiency, became virtually blind, although he retained a capacity to see colors consciously. For our psychophysical studies, we used a simplified Version of the Land experiments [Land, E. (1974) Proc. R. Inst G. B. 47, 23 - 58] to learn whether color constancy mechanisms are intact in him, which amounts to teaming whether he can assign a constant color to a surface in spite {{of changes in the}} precise wavelength composition of the light reflected from that surface. We supplemented our psychophysical studies with imaging ones, using functional magnetic resonance, to learn something about the location of areas that are active in his brain when he perceives colors. The psychophysical results suggested that color constancy mechanisms are severely defective in PB and that his color vision is wavelength-based. The imaging results showed that, when he viewed and recognized colors, significant in creases in activity were restricted mainly to V 1 -V 2. We conclude that a partly <b>defective</b> color system <b>operating</b> on its own in a severely damaged brain is able to mediate a conscious experience of color in the virtually total absence of other visual abilities...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of systems today {{generate}} and share textual descriptions of their products, services, and actions. Such assemblage of textual data contain significant amount of structured information, which reside in the unstructured text. While related information extraction algorithms facilitate the extraction of structured relations, they are often costly and <b>defective,</b> especially when <b>operating</b> on top of text that does not contain any instances of the final targeted structured information. We present a good alternative approach that facilitates the generation of the structured metadata by identifying documents {{that are likely to}} have information of interest and this information is going to be subsequently useful for querying the database. Our approach depends on the idea that instead of writing the query for each requirement it is easier to fetch them by using the annotated form based technique. In this approach user do not need to learn the correct query along with the previous information of the dataset. As a major contribution towards this paper, we present algorithms that identify structured attributes that are likely to find within the document, by jointly utilizing the content of the text and the query workload. Our experimental evaluation display that our approach generates superior results compared to approaches that go through textual content or only on the query workload, to identify attributes of our interest...|$|R
