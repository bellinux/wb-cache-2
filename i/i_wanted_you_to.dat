[...] Kate and Sawyer then have sex, unknowingly {{in full view of the}} cameras. At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor.

2500|$|Frames {{was made}} {{over the course of}} a year and a half. Unlike on his {{previous}} album, Live It Up, DeWyze served as a producer on Frames. Toby Gad was the only producer and co-writer to collaborate with DeWyze on both albums. DeWyze described the co-writing process on Live It Up as having been like speed-dating, but said that on Frames it felt like [...] "a full on collaboration." [...] He said that the recording process felt organic and that there was no [...] "pressure [...] to make a 'certain' type of record." [...] Free of this obligation, he chose not to confine himself to only writing folk rock songs and also included the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride," [...] which have been compared to the music of the Beatles, [...] "Fire Away," [...] which has been described as a combination of roots music and rockabilly, and [...] "Who Would've Known," [...] which has been described as a combination of pop and bluegrass. DeWyze specifically set out to write Frames so that it would [...] "flow as one," [...] harkening back to the kind of albums that he had listened to as a kid with his dad. He said, [...] "I wanted the vibe of the album as a whole to be cohesive. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be able to sit down and listen to the whole thing and have a musical experience with it." ...|$|E
