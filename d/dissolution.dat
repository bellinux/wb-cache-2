5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for <b>dissolution</b> and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the <b>dissolution</b> and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

This was not a purchase on behalf of the society and after a five-year delay, it was transferred under the will of Denys in 1516 to the Carthusian House of Jesus of Bethlehem (Sheen Priory), which remained the Society's landlord until 1539, when the Second Act of <b>Dissolution</b> led to the <b>Dissolution</b> of the Monasteries and passed ownership of the Inn to the Crown.|$|E

During electrorefining of copper and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the platinum group metals {{as well as}} selenium and tellurium settle {{to the bottom of}} the cell as anode mud, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending on the nature of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with sodium peroxide followed by <b>dissolution</b> in aqua regia, and <b>dissolution</b> in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid.|$|E

5|$|Membership is conferred for life. Formerly, {{the death}} of a monarch ("demise of the Crown") brought an {{immediate}} <b>dissolution</b> of the Council, as all Crown appointments automatically lapsed. By the 18th century, it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up to six months after the demise of the Crown. By convention, however, the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its <b>dissolution.</b> In practice, therefore, membership continued without a break. In 1901 the law was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly unaffected by any succession of monarch.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the money}} for the first phase of Device works came from Henry's <b>dissolution</b> of the monasteries a few years before, and the {{revenues}} that flowed in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the <b>dissolution</b> had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret's Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By {{the second phase of the}} programme, however, most {{of the money}} from the <b>dissolution</b> had been spent, and Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.|$|E

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we decompose changes in the odds of homogamy in prevailing marriages into three components: changes due to (1) new marriages, (2) marital <b>dissolutions,</b> and (3) educational upgrades after marriage. The odds of homogamy increase substantially as the cohort ages. These patterns are primarily driven by changes in the odds of homogamy among newlyweds entering their first marriages. Marital <b>dissolutions,</b> educational upgrades after marriage, and remarriages have smaller effects...|$|R

[Footnote 21: Of {{course there}} remains the {{question}} whether, before the stage here recognized, there {{had already been}} produced a high temperature by those collisions of celestial masses which reduced the matter to a nebulous form. As suggested in First Principles (§ 136 in the edition of 1862, and § 182 in subsequent editions), there must, after there have been effected all those minor <b>dissolutions</b> which follow evolutions, remain to be effected the <b>dissolutions</b> of the great bodies in and on which the minor evolutions and <b>dissolutions</b> have taken place; and it was argued that such <b>dissolutions</b> will be, at some time or other, effected by those immense transformations of molar motion into molecular motion, consequent on collisions: the argument being based on the statement of Sir John Herschel, that in clusters of stars collisions must inevitably occur. It may, however, be objected that though such a result may be reasonably looked for in closely aggregated assemblages of stars, {{it is difficult to}} conceive of its taking place throughout our Sidereal System at large, the members of which, and their intervals, may be roughly figured as pins-heads 50 miles apart. It would seem that something like an eternity must elapse before, by ethereal resistance or other cause, these can be brought into proximity great enough to make collisions probable.] ...|$|R
50|$|Confronted to such {{a slight}} and {{uncertain}} majority, Molé presented his resignation to the king on 22 January 1839. Louis-Philippe first attempted to refuse it, and then, approaching Marshal Soult, who was not initially persuaded, offered him the lead. Soult finally accepted after the funeral of the king's daughter, the duchesse de Württemberg, {{on the condition of}} moving promptly to new elections. During the electoral campaign, the left-wing opposition denounced what they termed a constitutional coup, comparing the 1837 and 1839 <b>dissolutions</b> to the consecutive <b>dissolutions</b> of Charles X in 1830. Thiers compared Molé to Polignac, one of Charles X's ministers.|$|R
