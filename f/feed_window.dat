40|$|Abstract—Wet antenna {{attenuation}} during rain {{events is}} examined through carrying out simulated rain experiments. These {{were conducted on}} the receiving antenna located at Penang, Malaysia. The findings from these experiments are used to estimate rain attenuation data for that path by adjusting the collected data for wet antenna attenuation. This was done for the 1 -year period of March 2007 to February 2008 and includes average and worst month cumulative distribution functions. The results of the measurement indicated that the wet antenna effect is a significant attenuator, and {{should be included in}} a link budget. The measured attenuation values were 4 dB for the wet <b>feed</b> <b>window</b> and total reflector plus <b>feed</b> <b>window</b> attenuation value of 6. 3 dB at 20. 2 GHz, at a rain rate of 100 mm/h. 1...|$|E

An experiment has been done to measure the losses on the antennas due to rain by spraying water. In order to separate this loss from the propagation loss, an analytical approach has been proposed.

40|$|Two-day {{life cycle}} tests with the rotifer Brachiomus calyciflorus were run {{to study the}} {{nutritional}} quality effects to rotifers of Scenedesmus pectinatus grown under non-limiting nitrogen limiting and phosphorus limiting conditions and the feedback of the rotifers oil the Food algae. Under nutrient-limited conditions of its algal food Brachionus production was depressed, animals produced fewer eggs and were smaller sized. Clearance rates of Brachionus offered non-nutrient-limited and nutrient-limited Food were similar. The number of cells per colony was similar for S. pectinatus Under nitrogen limited and phosphorus limited conditions both in the absence and presence of Brochionus. Cell volumes phosphorus limited S. pectinatus were larger than those of nitrogen limited cells. The most dramatic response of the food alga S. pectinatus was observed in non-nutrient-limited conditions: a strong, size enlargement occurred only in file presence of Brachionus. This {{was caused by a}} higher share of eight-celled colonies and larger individual Cell volumes in the Presence of rotifers than in their absence.

40|$|To {{examine how}} the major {{elements}} of global change affect herbivory in agroecosystems, a multi-factorial experiment was conducted in which soybeans were grown at two levels {{of carbon dioxide and}} temperature, including those predicted for 2050, under otherwise normal field conditions. Japanese beetles (Popilla japonica Newman) were enclosed on foliage for 24 hours, after which the beetle survivorship, total and per capita leaf consumption, and leaf protease inhibitor activity was measured. The direct effect of temperature on beetle consumption and survivorship was also measured under controlled environmental conditions. No differences in total foliage consumption were observed; however, beetles forced to feed at elevated temperature in the field demonstrated greater per capita consumption and reduced survivorship compared to beetles feeding at ambient temperature. Survivorship was also greater for beetles that consumed foliage grown under elevated CO 2, but there were no interactive effects of CO 2 and temperature, and no differences in leaf chemistry were resolved. Leaf consumption by beetles increased strongly with increasing temperature up to ~ 37 ?? C, above which increased mortality caused a precipitous decrease in consumption. An empirical model based on the temperature dependence of leaf consumption and flight suggests that a 3. 5 ??

40|$|The {{gastropod}} T. palustris {{is one of}} {{the major}} species responsible for leaf consumption and degration within the Indo-Pacific mangrove forests, and it strongly competes with herbivorous sesarmid crabs in consuming fallen leaves. This snail feeds at high and low tides and it is able to locate food items by means of chemical cues. The aim of this study was to assess the food preferences of T. palustris and to define its feeding strategies at low and high tides, by conducting field trials on water-borne mediated food location at high tide, grazing rate and the chemical attraction exerted by different mangrove leaves. The results showed that T. palustris was able to perceive underwater grazed leaves. In addition, we demonstrated that T. palustris consumes all the mangrove species (preferentially the Rhizophoraceae leaves) but Xilocarpus granatum. Moreover, this snail is differentially attracted to different mangrove species: the major attractive power is wielded by the rhizophoracean species and Pemphis acidula, while X. granatum does not attract this snail at all. The efficacy and adaptive value of a chemically mediated food searching strategies is unquestionable since by using this ability T. palustris can locate and reach the leaves it preferentially consumes. Moreover, T. palustris is the only macrobenthic species of East Africa mangroves able to search, detect and consume mangrove leaves at both high and low tides. Such an expanded <b>feeding</b> <b>window</b> permits T. palustris to occupy temporal niches left empty by the sesarmid crabs. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a commercially {{available}} anionic surfactant solution (FFD- 6) on growth and morphology of a common green alga (Scenedesmus obliquus) and on survival and clearance rates of the water flea Daphnia magna were studied. The surfactant-solution elicited a morphological response (formation of colonies) in Scenedesmus at concentrations of 10 – 100  μl l− 1 that were far below the No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) value of 1, 000 μl l− 1 for growth inhibition. The NOEC-value of FFD- 6 for colony-induction was 3  μl l− 1. Daphnia survival was strongly affected by FFD- 6, yielding LC 50 – 24 h and LC 50 – 48 h of 148 and 26  μl l− 1, respectively. In addition, clearance rates of Daphnia feeding on unicellular Scenedesmus were inhibited by FFD- 6, yielding a 50 % inhibition (EC 50 – 1. 5 h) at 5. 2  μl l− 1 with a NOEC of 0. 5  μl l− 1. When Daphnia were offered FFD- 6 -induced food in which eight-celled colonies (43  ×  29  μm) were most abundant, clearance rates (~ 0. 14  ml ind. − 1  h− 1) were only 25 % the rates of animals that were offered non-induced unicellular (15  ×  5  μm) Scenedesmus (~ 0. 56  ml ind. − 1 h− 1). As FFD- 6 concentrations in the treated food used in the experiments were far below the NOEC for clearance rate inhibition, it is concluded that the feeding rate depression {{was caused by the}} altered morphology of the Scenedesmus moving them out of the <b>feeding</b> <b>window</b> of the daphnids.

40|$|Circadian {{rhythms of}} {{behavior}} and physiology in rodents are regulated by a system of endogenous circadian oscillators synchronized to the external environment by two distinct pacemakers that are mutually coupled under normal conditions. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master light-entrainable pacemaker (LEP) that mediates synchrony to the day-night cycle. The second pacemaker is a food-entrainable pacemaker (FEP) {{and has yet to}} be identified, but is capable of synchronizing circadian rhythms to restricted feeding (RF) schedules independent of the SCN. Rat, hamster and mouse behavior and physiology entrains to RF despite complete SCN ablations. The studies that comprise this dissertation examine two candidate FEP structures: the thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT); and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). Both the PVT and DMH are promising targets given evidence suggesting they: 1) are active in anticipation of the <b>feeding</b> <b>window</b> (as described in glucose metabolism and c-fos imaging studies); 2) are involved in arousal, ingestive behavior, and visceral function; 3) have reciprocal connections with the SCN which could mediate proposed coupling between the LEP and FEP under normal conditions; and 4) have been implicated in prior lesion studies, whereby damage to these structures has been shown to attenuate food-anticipatory physiology or behavior. To determine whether the PVT or DMH are critical for the expression of food-entrainable circadian rhythms, in separate studies rats received unambiguously complete radiofrequency lesions of the target structures. PVT-lesioned rats as well as DMH-lesioned rats are essentially indistinguishable from intact controls in terms of their capacity to entrain to and anticipate RF schedules. These results indicate that neither the PVT, nor the DMH are necessary for circadian food entrainment and thus they can be ruled out as candidate FEP structures. A series of follow-up studies were conducted to identify and explain the reasons why the DMH lesion results described above were contrary to earlier reports that the DMH was critical for expression of food-entrainable circadian rhythms...|$|R
