It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E

After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates, {{and told him that}} they would {{continue}} with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> how internationally popular Dylan had become.|$|E

The dream gives Hilda an <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E

As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E

Khánh then went to sleep. Khánh headed to the staff headquarters, where {{he saw that the}} compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over without a shot being fired. Generals Dương Văn Minh, Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim woke up to find Khiêm's men surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers, having had no <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> the plot. Khánh put them under house arrest, later charging them with neutralism. In a morning radio broadcast Khánh said he had conducted the coup because of the junta's failure to make progress against the Viet Cong.

Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> what acting's all about." [...] TV-Radio Mirror {{magazine}} praised Presley's acting over his past roles: [...] "Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock. [...] But nobody is laughing now". Meanwhile, The Monthly Film Bulletin criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, [...] "This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie".|$|E
500|$|Adopted by the Heap {{family as}} a baby in place of Septimus, Jenna Heap is the {{daughter}} of an assassinated queen. She is a small girl, with deep violet eyes and fair complexion; she wears a deep red cloak and the gold circlet of the princess on her head. She is portrayed as loving and caring at heart, but sometimes very stubborn. In the first novel she has a pet rock called Petroc Trelawney (presumably named after Petroc Trelawny), which she loses when the Marram Marshes are flooded; she later acquires a pet duck called Ethel. The ambiguity of Jenna's characterization has been questioned, with one critic commenting: [...] "s the Princess or Queenling, she comes from a turbulent past and is thrust into the anonymous world of ordinary society without any <b>inkling</b> <b>of</b> her royal background. The reader is therefore left guessing whether or not she has it in her to rise to the tenets of her position as ruler of the Castle." ...|$|E

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23.
