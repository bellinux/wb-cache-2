40|$|Changing {{employer}} demands, new {{technological and}} pedagogical insights {{are examples of}} developments which urge Vocational Education and Training (VET) institutes to continually renew and innovate their educational programmes. This, in turn, requires teachers to show innovative behaviour. Our study focuses {{on the effects of}} task interdependence on VET teachers’ innovative behaviour. In addition, the mediating roles of learning goal orientation and occupational self-efficacy in this relationship are examined. A two-wave survey study among 342 teachers, from 54 teams of 6 Dutch VET institutes, showed that task interdependence enhanced teachers’ learning goal orientation, which <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in innovative behaviour over time. Task interdependence also increased teachers’ occupational self-efficacy, which in turn increased <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in innovative behaviour. This effect, however, appeared short lived. Apparently, once teachers exceed a certain level of occupational self-efficacy, other variables, like learning goal orientation, play a more important role in sustaining innovative behaviour. </p...|$|R

It presents the findings obtained from a qualitative study that explored students’ experiences of undertaking a group presentation/performance assessment task in an introductory critical social work course at a regional Australian university. Overall, the results from a survey with course participants suggest that a group presentation/performance assessment fostered collaboration and cooperation among first-year students in a way that <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> with each other, course material, and successful learning in this course. Students’ responses regarding the assessment task strongly indicate that <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> was not simply instrumental or formal, but rather ontological, in that the group presentation/performance engages the students’ being as reflexive agents of change in the learning and assessment processes...|$|R

Unravelling the consequences of responsible engagement and its impact for the tourism and hospitality industry, this study draws on Erikson’s psychological stage theory (Fyffe and Wister, 2016; Erikson, 1994), and questions the relevance of nonprofit brand heritage, generativity, communitas, and work engagement in relation to stimulating philanthropic transient volunteer tourists’ satisfaction with life (SWL) ...|$|E
40|$|Police rely on {{information}} and assistance from the community in order to disrupt and prevent acts of terrorism. However such assistance will not be forthcoming or sustained unless the police undertake effective forms of community engagement. This is particularly {{the case in the}} context of police working with Muslim communities to tackle radicalisation and violent extremism. However Muslim communities in Australia and abroad feel targeted and stigmatised due to counterterrorism policy and practice. This can make them distrustful of police and less willing to work in partnership with police. So what can police do then to enhance their outreach and engagement of Muslim communities? In this paper we examine this issue by reviewing evidence on the effectiveness of community engagement derived from research on the policing of Muslim communities. Based on this review we outline some key principles and recommendations that police should adopt to <b>enhance</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> efforts...|$|E

Therefore, educating the public and young generations to <b>enhance</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> and encourage them to reduce carbon emission and energy consumption in their daily life is becoming essential worldwide to drive continuous improvement towards more sustainable future. This paper presents an innovative educational tool to simulate energy performance and its use in educating university students and teaching school children about the subject. The paper outlines the developed educational tool and presents its benefits via two detailed case studies, with wide and diverse level of knowledge and learning outcomes. The educational technology includes a small-scale multi-layered model of buildings where insulation layers can be added to or removed from the building's envelop to influence energy performance. Qualitative and quantitative research has been conducted. The results show that the technology is capable of engaging the young generation and to help them to understand the thermal performance and energy efficiency of buildings...|$|E

40|$|Asynchronous online {{discussion}} {{has been shown}} to enhance communication between students and to elicit many cognitive indicators. Nevertheless, historians have often been reluctant to make use of such instructional technology. Students enrolled in a fully online world civilization course corroborated qualitative research findings regarding the cognitive indicators associated with asynchronous discussion. In contrast, students in face-to-face web-enhanced hybrid world civilization classes exhibited less dramatic cognitive indicators in asynchronous discussion, perhaps due to the greater maturity in terms of age and experience of the fully online students. Students in the hybrid class, however, did indicate that participation in online discussions <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in face-to-face in-class discussions. However, asynchronous discussions did not prompt the face-to-face students to achieve authentic dialog between students in the classroom, and neither group managed to transcend problems of inequitable participation in small groups. There remains a need for further research on how to transplant documented advantages of asynchronous discussion into the hybrid classroom. Unlike educators in disciplines such as communication studies (e. g., McComb, 1994...|$|R

A parallel research programme has focused on how students engage with their studies and what they, institutions and educators can do to <b>enhance</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement,</b> and hence success. This article reports on two syntheses of research literature on student engagement and how this can be enhanced. It first synthesizes 93 research studies from ten countries to develop a conceptual organizer for student engagement that consists of four perspectives identified in the research: student motivation; transactions between teachers and students; institutional support; and engagement for active citizenship. Secondly, the article synthesizes findings from these perspectives as ten propositions for improving student engagement in higher education.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{trends in}} the understanding of children as visitors to art and natural history museums. It begins by examining research into the qualities of engagement by museum visitors generally. It then addresses the specific challenges posed by children as visitors, and the responses developed by museums to <b>enhance</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement.</b> Three strategies are identified: social/family-centred interactivity, immersive experiences and engagement through interpretive dialogue. The three examples of programs of children’s engagement examined in this paper represent a major departure from such models towards a profoundly social form of interaction. The paper argues that these strategies are museums’ responses to shifts in pedagogical theory, and have been developed to increase the engagement of the child-visitor with exhibitions. Such strategies represent a genuine engagement between adults (both museum staff and parents) and children, and an opportunity for children to define the experience of cultural engagement. The consequence of this is a redefinition of the cultural role of museums in relation to children...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulty}} many undergraduate nursing students {{experience with}} science subjects is often attributed to deficiencies in background knowledge, but anxiety about science subjects could {{also play a}} role. While reports indicate that nursing students feel anxious about science-based subjects, {{the cause of this}} anxiety and how to reduce it has received less attention. This project aimed 1) to identify the sources of anxiety experienced by nursing students at the start of their first year, and 2) to develop a workshop to reduce anxiety and enhance engagement with science subjects. When surveyed, a substantial proportion of nursing students reported feeling anxious about a range of science and non-science-based activities. To address this anxiety, a two-day, face-to-face workshop was developed and made available to nursing students. Attendees report that the workshops reduced <b>their</b> anxiety and <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> with science subjects. In addition, the final grades and the rate of progression of workshop attendees through their nursing course have been significantly higher than non-attendees. These outcomes demonstrate that face-to-face workshops aimed at reducing anxiety can improve nursing student’s engagement with, and performance in, bioscience subjects...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} tasks {{which are}} situated in real-world contexts {{encourage students to}} draw connections between school-based mathematics and the real-world, <b>enhancing</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in learning. Such tasks often require varied interpretations of the real-world problem context resulting in multiple pathways of solutions. Although mathematical modelling has been introduced in the Singapore mathematics curriculum since 2007, its incorporation in schools has been limited. One reason for this could be that teachers are challenged by how best to facilitate for rich student mathematisation processes during such tasks. This chapter reports how a multi-tiered teaching experiment using design research methodology was conducted to build teachers’ capacity in designing, facilitating, and evaluating student mathematisation during mathematical modelling tasks with an intact class of Primary 5 students (aged 10 - 11). The use of videos was critical because grounded images helped capture the dynamics and complexity of authentic classroom interactions. This chapter highlights how video recordings of teacher-student interactions during a modelling task were harnessed during design methodology cycles, particularly during the Retrospective Analysis phase, to activate critical moments of learning for the teacher towards developing her competencies in facilitating students’ mathematisation processes...|$|R

Numerous studies have explored the influence of cultural, social, economic and political influences on young women's understandings of their bodies, physical activity, sport and physical education, although this research is limited to a focus on the western context. As a New Zealand physical education teacher in an international school in Taiwan, I set out to investigate the physical activity experiences of young women attending this school and the associated implications for teaching physical education. My study involved a focus group and in-depth interviews with four young women. I adopted a Bourdieudian approach in my data analysis in order to investigate ways in which the young women negotiated norms, rules, practices and expectations of femininity and physicality within and across multiple fields. A significant presence of an 'Asian mindset' was highlighted, which presented a focus on academic achievement and traditional Taiwanese forms of appropriate femininity and physicality. Resulting valuation systems often conflicted with those present in the physical education class. The findings revealed young women negotiated these value systems through various means. Some chose to accept and embody these values limiting <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in physical education, while other young women were empowered to challenge them, <b>enhancing</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in physical education. This study contributes to gender and physical education research as it offers a perspective of the diverse nature of young women's experiences in physical activity within a non-western context...|$|R

The structure of the local learning collaborative requires careful attention to old relationships and challenges local governmental leaders to help move participants from a competitive to collaborative environment. This study describes one county's experience applying the NIATx process improvement model via a local learning collaborative. Local substance abuse and mental health agencies participated in two local learning collaboratives designed to improve client retention in substance abuse treatment and client access to mental health services. Results of changes implemented at the provider level on access and retention are outlined. The process of implementing evidence-based practices by using the Plan-Do-Study-Act rapid-cycle change is a powerful combination for change at the local level. Key lessons include: creating a clear plan and shared vision, recognizing that one size does not fit all, using data can help fuel participant engagement, a long collaborative may benefit from breaking it into smaller segments, and paying providers to offset costs of participation <b>enhances</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement.</b> The experience gained in Onondaga County, New York, offers insights that serve as a foundation for using the local learning collaborative in other community-based organizations.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of treatment outcome and other explanatory variables in {{a cohort of}} TB patients reported to the London TB Register from 2003 to 2006. METHODS: An innovative definition of TB treatment outcome more suitable for low-incidence industrialised countries, such as the United Kingdom, was adopted. A multivariable logistic approach {{was used to assess}} predictors of unsuccessful outcome. RESULTS: A total of 12, 929 TB cases were notified from 2003 to 2006, of which 12 % (n = 1536) failed to complete TB treatment. The proportion of cases failing to complete treatment showed a significant decrease from 2003 to 2006 (13 % in 2003 vs. 10 % in 2006). Males, the elderly, hospitalised patients, short- and long-term immigrants, Whites and the least deprived were more likely to fail to complete treatment.

The centrality of assessment to the student experience is now well accepted within the research literature (Brown and Knight, 1994; Rust, 2002). In particular, formative assessment, or assessment that creates feedback to support future teaching and learning experiences, can be a powerful tool for enhancing learning (see Black and Wiliam, 1998). Given that feedback is most effective if it is considered or reflected upon, one of the key challenges is to actively engage sport students in formative assessment processes.

40|$|Throughout Europe, people {{experience}} and value nature in various ways, {{but they also}} experience the decline in biological diversity. Although successes have been achieved, nature policies have not been effective in all respects. Halting biodiversity loss and restoring ecological systems in the EU requires substantial action, in addition to current measures implemented under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. More effective implementation, more coherence with other policies and greater engagement by other sectors and the public are needed. A closer connection between {{the ways in which}} {{people experience}} and value nature and nature policy may <b>enhance</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in nature-related efforts. A more fundamental reflection on nature policies may be helpful. This has been done by PBL in its Nature Outlook study, which presents alternative ‘perspectives’ on the future of nature in the European Union. The synthesis report European nature in the plural 1 is primarily intended to provide inspiration for current strategic discussions on EU policies that are related to nature beyond 2020, whereas the current report provides complete versions of the storylines and visualisations of the perspectives. Thereby, it enables policymakers and stakeholders to derive more specific insights and ideas from the perspectives. The report may be used to generate insights for policies, facilitate communication and boost engagement in nature among other sectors and citizens. In order to stimulate this, the report explains how policymakers and stakeholders could use the perspectives to create joint visions. The Nature Outlook project consists of a baseline, a trend scenario, four perspectives and several policy messages.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the world economy}} have led to a new concept of international relations where emerging markets, notably BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) economies, create a strong counterweight to the already existing world powers of the Triad (US, EU and Japan) in both economic and political areas. This results from the reallocation of global economic activities, global consumption to emerging and developing countries and hence import/export destination shifts. BRICS economies can be described today as being highly integrated into international trade, thus <b>enhancing</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in the world economy. Even though the Triad remains among the most important trade partners for BRICS, their total share in BRICS’s trade is decreasing. This paper examines changing geographical trade patterns of BRICS’s exports in regard to significant changes in global trade shifts within the past decade. The aim of the paper is to identify product groups that are involved in BRICS’s trade relations development and show possible diversions. The assessment focuses on regional trade orientation among BRICS themselves and between BRICS and the Triad. The results are further tested on the consistency of the countries’ revealed comparative advantage together with the assessment of export trade intro-version, complementarity and trade barriers. The results indicate that BRICS’s exports to markets other than the Triad are increasing but consist of less significant product groups. The export intensity assessment provided rather independent evidence of BRICS’s current behaviour than BRICS as a group. The most significant trade diversion from the Triad to BRICS was identified for the Mineral fuels, oils, distillation products, etc. product group ex-ported by Brazil and South Africa to China and India...|$|R
40|$|With digital {{technologies}} {{replacing the}} previous source of entertainment and communication and becoming {{the primary means}} by which we are informed and entertained, {{there is a need}} to be informed and competent with the relevant skills. Also, there is a greater need to use the digital devices that are employed by students using these technologies, which tend to keep them captivated at all times. The aim of this study is twofold: to enhance student performance by improving the approach to feedback and enhance student engagement by improving student class participation with the use of their ‘disruptive’ devices. We hypothesize that student engagement with the digital devices lead to better and overall student performance. The areas identified for research were in relation to student feedback and engagement through the encouragement of their participation. The approach adopted in this research was the evaluation of the use of TopHat as a tool in the creation of an enhanced student-centred learning experience by creating an active learning environment. The strategy was to adhere to the usual idea of student tutorial and after an hour the first research activity started. This involved the use of the disruptive devices (mobile phones, iPads and Android devices) in a constructive manner. At the end of the session, TopHat was used to provide additional feedback and prepare them for their coursework. This was achieved through the use of ‘Tournament’ to find out each week those that that engaged and performed well. The results showed that 74. 8 % of the students are of the view that the use of Tophat <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in the module and 71. 9 % students perceived that higher level of feedback was received through Tophat. The impact of digital technology in higher education was discussed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Emerging from a {{personal}} and professional interest in student engagement with learning in secondary school science classrooms, this dissertation investigates the question: How do year 10 students understand, experience and respond to science teaching in secondary school? Through the voices of some year 10 secondary school science students in an Independent Christian Secondary school in Western Australia, supported by some aspects of my professional experience, this thesis identifies, describes and explains the kinds of classroom conditions conducive for enhancing student engagement in science learning. A case study approach was adopted to investigate student perceptions of engaging pedagogies in year 10 science classes. Seeking a diverse range of strengths, abilities and attributes, all year 10 students, 60 in all, were invited {{to take part in}} the research program. The participating students consisted of a mixed gender group of 18 year 10 students, all with some interest in science learning. The students were interviewed in pairs and in focus groups, about the kinds of pedagogical, organisational and cultural conditions that <b>enhanced</b> <b>their</b> <b>engagement</b> in science learning. A time frame matrix was adopted to guide open ended questions and discussions. Drawing on year 10 student past, present and future perceptions of when they were learning science, this thesis identifies as essential ingredients a knowledgeable, passionate and committed teacher, hands on learning, relevance and ownership of learning, and relational learning, that connects with, and is relevant to student engagement in science learning. Methodologically, the thesis acknowledges the value and importance of student voice in research relative to student engagement in science learning. Above all, the thesis reinforces the significance of building a relational learning environment that gives access to meaningful and relevant learning activities in science classrooms based on a culture of trust, respect and care...|$|R
