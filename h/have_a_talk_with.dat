25|$|On 16 February, the minibus driver {{reportedly}} {{changed his}} testimony, saying that, {{while he did}} commit the murder, he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol when he did so and did not intend to assault Özgecan sexually or kill her. He also claimed that it was Özgecan who started the fight by attacking him while he tried to take her to the destination through a shorter way, and that he had gone to the back of the minibus in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> her. He reportedly claimed (with the hopes of getting a reduced sentence) that Özgecan had given him 100 Turkish liras to make him take a shortcut. But this claim was denied by her parents, who stated that they had only given 20 Turkish Liras to their daughter.|$|E
500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it was because I tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lundqvist {{played in}} nine games for IF Mölndal Hockey in the Swedish second tier Allsvenskan, before joining Frölunda's junior {{team in the}} J20 SuperElit in December. After his poor play in Allsvenskan, and a tough start in the J20 SuperElit, he allowed six goals in an {{exhibition}} game against Canada. National junior team coaches Bo [...] "Kulon" [...] Lennartsson and Mikael Tisell were worried and decided to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> Lundqvist, where they questioned his motivation. Lundqvist's turning point came {{at the turn of}} the year at the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Moscow, where he led the Swedish national junior's team to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. He spent the rest of the season in the J20 SuperElit where he played 18 games, leading the league in minutes played by a goaltender. In the playoffs, he led Frölunda to their second straight Anton Cup win, which came in a 5–2 win over Leksands IF in the final at the Stockholm Globe Arena.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of May 9, 1919, Europe {{performed}} for the last time. He had been feeling extremely ill all day, but {{wanted to go on}} with the concert (which was to be the first of three in Boston's Mechanics Hall). During the intermission Europe went to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> two of his drummers, Steve and Herbert Wright. After Europe criticized some of their behavior (walking off stage during others' performances), Herbert Wright became very agitated and threw his drumsticks down in a seemingly unwarranted outburst of anger. He claimed Europe did not treat him well and that he was tired of getting blamed for others' mistakes. He lunged for Europe with a penknife and was able to stab him in the neck. Europe told his band to finish the set and he would see them the next morning. To Europe and his band the wound seemed superficial. As he was carried away, he told them [...] "I'll get along alright." [...] At the hospital, they could not stop the bleeding and he died hours later.|$|E
