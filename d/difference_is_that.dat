5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, {{offers more}} puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Karelian Trains, a {{joint venture}} by VR and RZhD, started a new service linking Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia using {{a new model of}} the Pendolino called the Sm6 Allegro. The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The train is capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> StarOffice only {{supports}} 12 languages, {{compared to}} over 110 for OpenOffice.org.|$|R
50|$|The most {{attractive}} feature of finite <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{very easy to}} implement.|$|R
25|$|The major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of neutropenia in the peginterferon groups.|$|R
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama {{and a small}} pagri (top hat) worn {{on top of the}} head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
50|$|A-45 based {{technically}} on {{its predecessor}} KB-45. The most significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Kirkstall axles were substituted by Sisu's own axles.|$|R
3000|$|The only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> p {{value of}} the α_ 1 [...] in the female {{participation}} rate equation was just above 0.05.|$|R
50|$|Overall {{design was}} {{very similar to the}} Honda TA150. The major <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the TA200 {{contains}} a four-stroke engine and higher 197 cc displacement.|$|R
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana {{is discussed in}} all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is quite {{similar to that of}} the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where the only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Lutheran calendar commemorates {{a wider variety}} of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
50|$|Is {{quite similar}} to the {{canonical}} sequence, the only <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sequence of amino acids in 195th-218th position (RPPAPSLRATRHSRAAAVDPTPAA) is substituted by proline (P).|$|R
5000|$|Lisa {{arrives at}} the school by mistake in the episode [...] "Trilogy of Error", one of the <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> French <b>is</b> taught at this school.|$|R
50|$|The mint {{standards}} were {{set by the}} Spanish crown and until 1686 the coinage of Spain and of the Indies (Spanish America) were identical, save in two respects. A minor <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> coins minted in America were inscribed REX HISPANIARVM ET INDIARVM (king of the Spains and the Indies), while those minted in Spain had only REX HISPANIARVM. The major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> vellón or copper coins were not minted for circulation in the Spanish American colonies, while after 1602 the currency of Spain itself consisted chiefly of copper coin.|$|R
5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the ethical stage. Victor Eremita found {{a group of}} letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William, another pseudonymous author, to 'A', trying to convince 'A' {{of the value of}} the ethical stage of life by arguing that the ethical person can still enjoy aesthetic values. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> machinima {{is created}} in real time, but other {{animation}} is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every {{strand of hair}} on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
25|$|The 1977 charter was {{virtually}} {{the same as the}} 1976 constitution. The only key <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the name of the junta was changed to the National Policy Council.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> {{motorways}} have emergency {{lanes and}} the maximum allowed speed limit is 130 km/h, while expressways do not {{and the speed}} limit is 120 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The 1977 charter was {{virtually}} {{the same as the}} 1976 constitution. The only key <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the name of the junta was changed to the National Policy Council.|$|R
5|$|Mullum Malarum {{is based}} on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was {{published}} in the Tamil magazine, Kalki. The story, about the love between a brother and sister, won the first prize in Kalkis Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine's 1966 silver jubilee. Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran's novel, but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister, as well as the loss of his arm. He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar, who was impressed. Adapting Umachandran's novel for the screen, Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film's dialogue. His screenplay diverged from the novel's plot, and he decided to make a minimalist, visually-rich film without melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue or duets. A significant <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in the novel, Kali loses his arm to a tiger while in the film, he loses it due to it being run over by a lorry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E
50|$|Mona's Queen was {{virtually}} identical to her older sister, King Orry. The only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the main mast crosstrees on Mona’s Queen {{were higher than}} those on King Orry.|$|R
50|$|This was an {{expansion}} of the 1301 system. The biggest <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the system could support 16 key stations (in 2 banks of 8 stations) and 12k of memory.|$|R
60|$|There she was, {{sitting in}} the same arm-chair, looking as massive as ever. The only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she didn't uncover the teeth, as she had done the first time.|$|R
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} {{calls for the}} mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call. The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed. The nest relief and begging calls are only used by the males.|$|E
25|$|Many of the fission {{products}} volatilized {{are the same}} ones volatilized in non-fluorinated, higher-temperature volatilization, such as iodine, tellurium and molybdenum; notable <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> technetium <b>is</b> volatilized, but caesium is not.|$|R
30|$|Phased pump units was a beam {{pumping units}} with high performance, {{developing}} in recent several decades such as CYJY in China and Mark/Mark II in USA. Phased pump units had two differences against to conventional pump units: the first <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> its gearbox <b>was</b> deviated from the holder, the second <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> a balance phase angle {{in the center}} of gravity of counterbalance, the crank always fall behind with phase angle in clockwise. Therefore, in the upstroke, the acceleration and dynamic load of phase pump units decreased, and the peak torque of gearbox decreased (Feng et al. 2016).|$|R
50|$|The Eagle Station grouplet has a {{composition}} similar to Main group pallasites. Diagnostic <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the olivine <b>is</b> richer in iron and calcium. The grouplet {{also has a}} distinct oxygen isotope signature.|$|R
