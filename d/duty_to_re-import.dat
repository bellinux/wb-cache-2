40|$|Clinicians {{and health}} {{researchers}} frequently encounter opportunities to rescue people. Rescue cases can generate a moral <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> aid those in peril. As such, bioethicists have leveraged a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue {{for a variety}} of purposes. Yet, despite its broad application, the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue is under-analyzed. In this paper, we assess the state of theorizing about the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue. There are large gaps in bioethicists’ understanding of the force, scope, and justification of the two most cited <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> rescue—the individual <b>duty</b> of easy rescue and the institutional rule of rescue. We argue that the duty of easy rescue faces unresolved challenges regarding its force and scope, and the rule of rescue is indefensible. If the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue is to help solve ethical problems, these theoretical gaps must be addressed. We identify two further conceptions of the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue that have received less attention—an institutional duty of easy rescue and the professional <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue. Both provide guidance in addressing force and scope concerns and, thereby, traction in answering the outstanding problems with the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue. We conclude by proposing and propose research priorities for developing accounts of <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> rescue in bioethic...|$|R

40|$|In {{liability}} insurance, the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend is {{broader than}} the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> cover. Thus {{it is possible}} that an insurer that has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend a suit may not have the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> cover the policyholder 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities in the suit. However, if the penalty for a breach of the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend is limited to actual legal costs spent by the defendant, the insurer may have an incentive to refuse to defend, even when the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend is clear. This occurs because the insurer will not internalize the consequences of an inadequate defense when it ultimately can avoid covering the claim. If the penalty for a breach of the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend also includes a forfeiture of the right to contest coverage of the claim, the insurer will never refuse to defend when the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend is clear, but such a penalty could induce an insurer to defend even when it has a good legal argument against the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend. We argue that tying a forfeiture of the right to assert any defense of coverage to an unreasonable refusal to defend can give an insurer incentives to internalize the cost of an inadequate defense while allowing the insurer to make reasonable legal arguments challenging a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> defend...|$|R

40|$|No {{one can be}} {{an expert}} in every area. In order to avoid {{wasteful}} duplication of effort, people generally rely on other members of society who expertise in that field. Yet reliance and trust pose risks for the trusting and dependent persons. When people notice such risks, they will either take extra steps to verify the truth or avoid the use of other people"s services. Eventually, the cost to both society and its members are likely to rise. However, recognition of fiduciary duties in entrusting relationship may facilitate reliance among members in society by reducing the risks for entrusting members. Although the current Korean Civil Code does not explicitly recognize fiduciary duties in agency and mandate relationship, agent and mandatee have <b>duties</b> similar <b>to</b> those of fiduciaries. However, {{considering the fact that}} agency and mandate relationships are based on reliance and trust between principal and agent or mandator and mandatee, the scope of mandatee"s <b>duties</b> need <b>to</b> be expanded. For example, mandatee currently has <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> account, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> delegate the fiduciary services <b>to</b> others, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> follow instructions, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> transfer objects acquired for mandator, and duty of care. However, the scope of mandatee"s <b>duties</b> need <b>to</b> be expanded <b>to</b> include <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> avoid self dealing, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> compete, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep confidential information, and <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep separate account. For the agent, Korean Civil Code imposes <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> avoid self dealing, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> compete, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> follow instructions, <b>duty</b> not <b>to</b> delegate the fiduciary services <b>to</b> others, and <b>duty</b> of care. This needs to be expanded <b>to</b> include <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> account, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep separate account, <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> keep confidential information. However, recognition of general rules of fiduciary duties would not be required. In addition, the scope of fiduciary"s duties should be different based on characteristics of each entrusting relationships. Some fiduciary relationships are undoubtedly more intense than others. So the greater the independent authority to be exercised by the fiduciary, the greater the scope of his fiduciary duty. For instance, a trustee should be under a stricter duty of loyalty than an agent upon whom limited authority is conferred or a corporate director who can act only {{as a member of the}} board of directors. However, considering the fact that agency and mandate relationships are also entrusting, fiduciary, relationships which pose risks of abuse of power, these relationships should be subject to the fiduciary principle, although not to the same extent...|$|R

The basis for such duties is that animal welfare, on my revised Kantian view, is neither a conditioned nor unconditioned good, but a final and nonderivative good {{that ought to be}} treated as an end-in-itself. However, this <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> promote animal welfare operates according to a broadly consequentialist logic that both accords well with our considered judgments about our <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> animals and explains differences between these duties and <b>duties</b> owed <b>to</b> rational agent...|$|R

40|$|Combatants in war inflict untold devastation. They lay {{waste the}} environment, destroy {{cultural}} heritage, wound, maim, and kill. Most importantly, they kill. These deeds would be, {{in any other}} context, paradigmatically unjust. This thesis asks whether they can be justi-fied. There are two possible approaches: first, deny that killing in war is in fact unjust; sec-ond, argue that the injustice is overridden by weightier moral reasons. In Part I, I reject the view that principles of self-defence can render killing in war just. I argue that the most plausible theories of self-defence are hardest to apply in the cha-otic context of war, while the most practicable theories are least philosophically defensible. Moreover, none of them encompasses the inevitable noncombatant deaths that all wars bring. If killing in war is almost always unjust, perhaps we should advocate pacifism. In Part II, I propose an alternative, arguing that these injustices might be all things con-sidered justified. Combatants have morally important relationships: they have deep personal relationships with friends and family, and comrades-in-arms; if they are citizens of just communities, then that relationship is valuable too. I argue that they have associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect these relationships against {{the threat posed by}} war, and that these duties may override the injustices they must commit to avert that threat. After defending a conception of associative duties, I support this conclusion with the following argument. As well as our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, we have general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. Our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect sometimes override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, in particular, in cases of justified humanitarian intervention. Our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, however, are stronger than our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. If our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect are stronger than our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, and our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect can override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, then our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect should also be able to override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm.

40|$|The {{original}} Tarasoff decision {{created a}} duty for California psychotherapists to warn potential victims of their patients. After rehearing the matter two years later, the California Supreme Court, in the landmark second Tarasoff decision, changed the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> warn <b>to</b> a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> protect potential victims, with warning as {{only one of}} the options for discharging that duty. Despite this change, the Tarasoff duty frequently was referred to erroneously as a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> warn. This misunderstanding and an ambiguous California immunity statute culminated in “simplified ” jury instructions and two appellate court decisions in 2004 in which it was assumed without question that there was a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> warn, with liability for not doing so regardless of rationale.
