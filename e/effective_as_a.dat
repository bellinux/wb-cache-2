5|$|At Panola, Oppong earned all-conference {{honors and}} led them to a fairly {{successful}} season in the NJCAA Region XIV. Entering the next season, he became a high-end Canadian recruit for programs in the NCAA. Oppong ultimately chose to play for Eastern Kentucky under head coach Jeff Neubauer. He was a starter {{from time to time}} as his junior season progressed. However, he suffered a shoulder injury {{in the middle of the}} season that sidelined him for several of his games. He returned to the starting lineup by the postseason. Oppong did not earn any major awards at the Division I level, but was considerably more <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> senior, as he developed into a bigger scorer for Eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with the rest of the team.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 IPL season, {{which was}} held in South Africa, Kartik played in ten matches and took four wickets at 50.25, but {{he was one of}} the most {{economical}} bowlers, conceding only 5.91 runs per over. Kolkata were wracked by infighting and came last. Kartik also scored 21 runs without being dismissed. In the 2009 English season, Kartik resumed service for Middlesex, and as in the IPL he was most <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stock bowler, taking only four wickets at 51.50 in eight T20 fixtures at an economy rate of 6.86, never taking multiple wickets in a match. Middlesex, who had won the domestic title the previous year, only tasted victory in two of the Twenty20 matches that Kartik played in.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|The 15/16 June 1944 raid on Yawata {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the USAAF's strategic bombing campaign against Japan. The city was struck again by B-29s during daylight and night raids on 20August, but no serious damage was caused. XX Bomber Command conducted 49 raids from its bases in China and India between June 1944 and March 1945, of which nine were made on targets in the Japanese home islands, but Operation Matterhorn did not achieve its goals. Despite initial problems, XXI Bomber Command's operations from the Mariana Islands, which began on 28October 1944, proved much more <b>effective.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, XX Bomber Command was transferred to the Mariana Islands in early 1945. Yawata was targeted again by B-29s on 8August 1945, two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. On this day the city was attacked by 221 B-29s escorted by three groups of P-47N Thunderbolt fighters including the 318th fighter group based on Ie Shima off the coast of Okinawa. The bombers were armed with incendiary bombs and the resulting firestorm destroyed 21percent of Yawata's urban area.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and {{spent too much time}} away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E

5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conventional rear wheel brake, but not as <b>effective</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> front wheel brake.|$|E
