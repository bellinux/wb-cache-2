[...] These AVT modes differ radically from the other modes mentioned above, in that they are synchronous, that is, they have no per-line horizontal synchronization pulse but instead use the standard VIS vertical signal to identify the mode, followed by a frame-leading <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> train which pre-aligns the frame timing by counting first one way and then the other, allowing the pulse train to be locked in time at any single point out of 32 where it can be resolved or demodulated successfully, after which they send the actual image data, in a fully synchronous and typically interlaced mode.|$|E

5000|$|The {{transceiver}} chip's {{primary purpose}} is to retrieve information from the [...] "line", i.e., the conductive line that transverses distance, by receiving the pulses and converting the signal which {{has been subjected to}} noise, jitter, and other interference, to a clean <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> on the other interface of the chip.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a new FPGA-based method for coincidence detection in positron emission tomography. The method requires low device resources and no specific peripherals in order to resolve coincident <b>digital</b> <b>pulses</b> within a time window of a few nanoseconds. This method has been validated with a low-end Xilinx Spartan- 3 E and provided coincidence resolutions lower than 6 ns.

50|$|While {{the basic}} {{physical}} set-up of the aperture format is consistent in every Coulter counter, {{the amount and}} quality of data varies greatly {{as a function of}} the signal processing circuitry implemented. For example, amplifiers with lower noise thresholds and greater dynamic range can increase the sensitivity of the system. Similarly, <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> height analyzers with variable bin widths provide much higher resolution data as opposed to analog analyzers with fixed bins. Further, combining a COULTER COUNTER® with a digital computer allows capture of many electrical pulse characteristics, while analog counters typically store a much more limited amount of information about each pulse.|$|E

The standard voltage is 4.8 V DC, however 6 V and 12 V {{has also been}} seen for a few servos. The control signal is a digital PWM signal with a 50 Hz frame rate. Within each 20 ms timeframe, an active-high <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> controls the position. The pulse nominally ranges from 1.0 ms to 2.0 ms with 1.5 ms always being center of range.

50|$|The {{electronics}} {{inside the}} pistol {{consist of a}} light detector or photo-diode and a small amplifier and buffer. Lightcoming down the barrel is focused by a small plastic lens onto the photo-diode, and the device is sensitiveenough to detect the changes in intensity of the picture. Once boosted by the amplifier, the signal is clipped toprovide a <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> rather than an analogue waveform and is then fed to the computer via the switch. Thescreen position that is being scanned at that moment is the position the rifle is pointing at. As the computerreceives the pulse from the Light Rifle it compares {{the value of its}} scan registers with the screen position of thetarget and, if a match is found, the played has scored a direct hit.|$|E

50|$|The {{frequency}} {{at which}} the crystal oscillates depends on its shape, size, and the crystal plane on which the quartz is cut. The positions at which electrodes are placed can slightly change the tuning, as well. If the crystal is accurately shaped and positioned, it will oscillate at a desired frequency. In nearly all quartz watches, the frequency is 32,768 Hz,and the crystal is cut in a small tuning fork shape on a particular crystal plane. This frequency is a power of two (32,768 = 215), just high enough so most people cannot hear it, yet low enough to permit inexpensive counters to derive a 1-second pulse. A 15-bit binary digital counter driven by the frequency will overflow once per second, creating a <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> once per second. The pulse-per-second output {{can be used to}} drive many kinds of clocks.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{technique}} for many radar systems (usually {{also found in}} SAR systems) is to [...] "chirp" [...] the signal. In a [...] "chirped" [...] radar, the pulse is allowed to be much longer. A longer pulse allows more energy to be emitted, and hence received, but usually hinders range resolution. But in a chirped radar, this longer pulse also has a frequency shift during the pulse (hence the chirp or frequency shift). When the [...] "chirped" [...] signal is returned, it must be correlated with the sent pulse. Classically, in analog systems, it is passed to a dispersive delay line (often a SAW device) that has the property of varying velocity of propagation based on frequency. This technique [...] "compresses" [...] the pulse in time - thus having {{the effect of a}} much shorter pulse (improved range resolution) while having the benefit of longer pulse length (much more signal returned). Newer systems use <b>digital</b> <b>pulse</b> correlation to find the pulse return in the signal.|$|E

A major application of this work is for a replacement of conventional analog-to-digital converters in some applications where simpler analog hardware is traded off for more complex reconstruction {{on the part of}} the subsequent digital processor. Realistic SPICE simulations of CMOS spiking neurons show that accurate reconstruction with more than 12 -bit precision can be achieved.
