Two sites, the nature reserve Borkovická Blata and the nature locality Na Plachtě, were selected for this work. Ephemeral (seasonally <b>dessicating)</b> and permanent pools differed in the structure of desmid communities but the difference was signifacant only for Borkovická blata. At both localities, the samples from the <b>dessicating</b> pools showed in average lower species richness and Shannon's diversity index than samples from non-dessicating pools, but the differences between these groups of samples were not statistically significant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{theory of}} the origin and {{distribution}} of fishes in the Harney Basin is presented. Blitzen River, the hydrographically and ecologically isolated creeks, and the upland tributaries of Silvies River all contain populations derived from the basin's Pleistocene connection with Malheur River of the Snake system. Colonization of many streams took Place during periods of high precipitation; isolation has resulted froth <b>dessicating</b> trends since the last glaciation. Stream capture has apparently facilitated a secondary invasion of fishes into Silvies River from John Day River, {{a tributary of the}} lower Columbia. This conclusion is further supported by the presence of several species only in central Silvies River within the basin. Certain populations similar to those occurring in isolated regions of the Harney Basin also exist above the barrier falls of the south fork of John Day River, but this drainage is believed to be another disrupted fragment containing descendants of a more ancient Columbia fauna.

40|$|Corn {{reddening}} (CR), {{observed for}} the first time in Serbia in 1957, has occurred sporadically there ever since, especially in the Banat area. However, in 2002 and 2003 severe outbreaks took place in late July-early August. Initial symptoms of CR consist in the apperance of a red-violet color on the leaves, leaf sheaths, husks and the bare portion of the internodes. Discolourations typically appear at the milk maturity stage, being strongest on top leaves, around the mid-rib and along the edges of the leaf blade, from base to tip. The ears are underdeveloped and kernels are shrivelled. Soon af-ter symptom development, affected plants wilt, the fo-liage <b>dessicates</b> rapidly, most of the red pigmentation disappears, and affected plants eventually die.

We recover densities, temperatures, and escape rates under the assumption of spherical symmetry for multiple periods across MAVEN's mission so far, beginning in December 2014 (escape rates ~ 4 e 8 /cm 2 /s).

40|$|Under {{desiccated}} conditions tardigrades {{can enter}} a state known as anhydrobiosis, which {{enables them to}} survive without metabolism until favourable conditions resume. Studies have suggested that desiccation can cause accumulation of DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This {{is due to the}} metabolic arrest and hereby the cessation of DNA repair systems during anhydrobiosis. In order to quantify this accumulation of DNA damage, previous studies have used comet assay. This method relies on breaks in double stranded DNA as a biomarker, but due to the cellular DNA repair mechanism comet assay may yield a false positive result. As an alternative, the oxidized base 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxo-dG) {{can be used as a}} biomarker for oxidative damage of DNA. By isolation of tardigrade DNA using alcohol precipitation and detection of 8 -oxo-dG in the isolated DNA by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study has tested the applicability of the ELISA to measure DNA damage in tardigrades. Furthermore, the difference in the amount of DNA damage between Richtersius coronifer <b>dessicated</b> for 9 months and R. coronifer <b>dessicated</b> for 18 months was tested. The ELISA was successful in quantifying 8 -oxo-dG in purified tardigrade DNA, but no increased amount of 8 -oxo-dG was detected in the samples containing R. coronifer <b>dessicated</b> for 18 months in comparison with R. coronifer <b>dessicated</b> for 9 months. It is concluded that the ELISA is a good alternative to comet assay for quantifying DNA damage in R. coronifer.

In this paper {{it is argued that}} the DOC production from <b>dessicated</b> sediments by water turbulence may be of similar importance In many water quality models production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is modelled as mineralisation from particulate organic matter (POM). In this paper it is argued that the DOC production from <b>dessicated</b> sediments by water turbulence may be of similar importance. The DOC production from sediments was measured under sterile conditions, as a function of shaking time, sediment to water ratio and OC content. Furthermore, the maximum fraction of particulate organic carbon (POC) that can be mobilised by agitation (excluding the contribution of mineralisation) was assessed. The experiments can be considered as laboratory simulations of resuspension of aquatic sediments due to turbulence caused by wind, benthivorous fish or dredging. It was found that aquatic resuspension of <b>dessicated</b> sediment may cause mobilisation of up to 100 % of indigenous particulate carbon in a few weeks. An empirical equation was derived that expresses mobilised carbon (DOC) as a function of sediment concentration (POC), OC fraction (foc) and time. At a typical value of 25 mg/L suspended sediment, the halflife for mobilisation is 0. 5 day, which is much faster than bacterial degradation of POM in aquatic systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To {{study the}} {{contribution}} of a novel PAF receptor antagonist LAU- 0901 in the modulation of the increased inflammatory response in mice exposed to <b>dessicating</b> conditions (DE) after PRK. Methods. Eighty 13 - 14 week old female Balb/C mice were used. They {{were divided into two}} groups: One group was treated with LAU- 0901 topical drops. The other group was treated with vehicle. In each group ten mice served as controls and ten were placed in DE. The other twenty mice underwent bilateral PRK and were divided in two additional groups: ten mice remained under normal conditions (NC) and the other ten were exposed to DE. After 1 week all animals underwent in vivo confocal microscopy, immunostaining and western blotting analysis. Results. Confocal microscopy showed an increased number of reflective structures in the corneal epithelium after PRK and exposure to DE in eyes treated with vehicle as compared to eyes treated with LAU- 090). Significant decrease of COX- 2 and Arginase I expression and reduced alpha SMA cells was observed after PRK and exposure to DE in eyes treated with LAU- 0901.

40|$|Effects of {{two types}} of timbering on populations of the Peaks of Otter {{salamander}} (Plethodon hubrichti) were determined using average numbers found during multiple night collections. Sampling was done prior to, and for two years after, timbering on four sites in each of three treatments (clearcut, shelterwood cuts, and reference). The average numbers of P. hubrichti at the reference and shelterwood cut sites were stable over time while those at the clearcut sites showed a significant decrease post-timbering. Two years after timbering, 30 % of the pre-timbering populations remained at the clearcut sites. Jolly-Seber population estimates on one clearcut site decreased from 43 to eight animals after cutting. In contrast, one reference site had a population estimate that oscillated around a mean of 71. Of the animals marked before timbering, significantly fewer were recaptured after timbering at the clearcut site (17. 5 %) relative to the reference site (39. 0 %). Juveniles {{appeared to be the}} size class affected to the greatest degree. Adults and juveniles on clearcuts most likely emigrated and/or died after treatment. While most investigators believe that timbering is harmful to salamanders, it is difficult to document the effects. Most studies use population censuses in timbered areas and compare these numbers to adjacent untimbered areas. Salamander populations in timbered areas are usually lower, and sometimes absent, when compared to untimbered areas (Blymer and McGinnes, 1977; Bury, 1983; Enge and Marion, 1986; Pough et al., 1987; Ash, 1988; Bury and Corn, 1988; Stiven and Bruce, 1988; Welsh, 1990; Raymond and Hardy, 1991; Petranka et al., 1993; Dupuis et al., 1995). It is thought that opening the forest canopy increases exposure of the forest floor to sun and wind. This <b>dessicates</b> the habitat, thus reducing habitat quality for salamanders. Plethodontid salamanders may be particularly sensitive to habitat changes due to timbering since they are lungless, requiring moist skin for gas exchange, and are fully terrestrial, requiring moist microhabitats for egg development (Pough et al., 1987). Salamander populations are not {{the only part of the}} forest ecosystem affected by timbering. Duffy and Meier (1992) reported that the herbaceous community may not recover to the same pre-timbering species diversity in 40 - 150 year logging cycles. Forest floor organic matter decreased exponentially to about 50 % of the initial levels within 15 yr following timbering, then recovered over the next 50 yr to within 5 % of pre-timbering levels (Covington, 1981). Seastedlt and Crossley (1981) reported that microarthropod decomposers were significantly less abundant two years after timbering. Many changes can occur with loss of the forest canopy, some of which would directly affect food availability to salamanders (Mitchell et al., 1996). There are drawbacks to most earlier assessments of the effects of timbering on salamander populations. Foremost is most earlier studies assume that the pre-timbering population levels in the treatment and reference (control) sites were similar. Since salamander populations may have clumped dispersion patterns (Kramer et al., 1993) this assumption may not be justified. In this study both pre and post-timbering population levels were assessed for an endemic species, Plethodon hubrichti...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) [...] Boston UniversitySixty-six non-pedigreed gravid albino hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) {{were exposed}} to a single dose of hypoxia of five to ten hours {{duration}} between the seventh and tenth days of gestation in order that the period during which the embryonic excretory system is most sensitive to {{the action of the}} teratogen might be determined. Maximum sensitivity occurred during the 10 hour interval between 1 : 30 - 11 : 30 a. m. on the 8 th day of development (post ovulatory) which is coincident with the period of most rapid differentiation, morphogenesis, and changes in body form (twisting and flexing). The oxygen pressure was equivalent to 40. 5 to 48. 6 mm. Hg or 25. 5 to 30. 6 percent of normal atmospheric oxygen. Hypoxia was effected by use of an improvised altitude chamber consisting of two large-sized <b>dessicating</b> jars, a supply of compressed air, a vacuum pump, and a mercury manometer. The reduction of atmospheric pressure was approximately that found at an altitude of 30, 500 feet. 	Three hundred and five embryos were examined for gross abnormalities after 15 - 16 days of development. One hundred eighteen embryos were sacrificed between 9 1 / 2 - 12 1 / 2 days of gestation and examined histologically for abnormalities of the developing excretory system. 	The array of congenital abnormalities detected was related to the time and duration of exposure of the maternal organism to the hypoxic insult. Mortality and morbidity rates increased as the duration of hypoxia increased. Abnormalities identified included exencephalocoel, micrognatha, hare-lip, vertebral and rib defects, limb abnormalities, cryptorchidism, renal defects, hydroureter, uterine aplasia, herniated diaphragm, abnormal spinal cord, and one instance of a double testis on one side. The renal defects included renal agenesis, discontinuity of the mesonephric duct, premature and ectopic termination of the mesonephric duct, development of accessory ducts from the mesonephric duct, multiple metanephric pelves forming about combinations of accessory ducts, mesonephric duct and ureteric buds, and malpositioning of the metanephroi. 	Evidence is presented to indicate that the mesonephric duct of the hamster grows by elongation of a growing tip rather than by accretion of new cells from the urogenital ridge during its posterior development. The mesonephric duct, accessory ducts (elongate diverticulae from the mesonephric ducts in areas other than that which normally gives rise to the ureter), and the ureteric tip are all capable of inducing development of the metanephric blastema. It is proposed that the collecting ducts of the chick mesoenprhos are homologous with the accessory ducts and the ureteric buds of the mammal. The abnormalities of development of the mesonephric duct are believed to be due to inhibition of growth and/or differentiation and the incompatibility of localized areas of development with normal mesonephrogenic tissue. 	It is postulated that normal surface related phenomena involved in cell migration or guidance systems have been interrupted. It is proposed that this {{may be the result of}} simple retardation of development, inability of the embryo to complete appropriate biochemical syntheses, or accumulation of toxic substances. Alteration in permeability of placental blood vessels might also be a complicating factor. 	It is suggested that the use of non-pedigreed animals with genetic parameter limited only by the similarity in coat color has possibly afforded a greater variety of effect than would have been obtained under more closely controlled genetic conditions.

However, the additional fixation step {{at the beginning of the}} in situ hybridization procedure should ensure adequate fixation of such tissues prior to hybridization. This protocol has been used successfully on large (up to 1 cubic cm) and small (1 cubic mm) tissue samples. 4 **% Paraformaldehyde** - Mix in a two liter flask: - 200 ml 0. 5 M NaPO 4, pH 7. 4 - 800 ml depcH 20 - Heat to 70 °C with stirring on hot plate in fume hood - Add 40 g Paraformaldehyde (EM grade, Polysciences, Cat No. 0380) - Once the solution has cleared (it should take 5 minutes or less), filter with a side-arm flask, Buchner funnel and Whatman No. 2 filter paper. - Immediately pour the solution into a one liter bottle which has been packed in ice. This cools the solution quickly and prevents breakdown of the paraformaldehyde. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks. ** 15 % Sucrose in PBS:** - 500 ml sterile PBS - 75 g "RNase free" sucrose - Mix above and filter sterilize with a disposable Nalgene filtration unit type S(0. 45 micron). Store at 4 °C. **USE OF FISHERBRAND SUPERFROST/PLUS MICROSCOPE SLIDES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** We use Fisherbrand SuperFrost/Plus positively-charged microscope slides (Cat. No. 12 - 550 - 15) for all of our frozen tissue sectioning and have very good tissue retention on slides after an in situ hybridization experiment. SuperFrost/Plus slides require no preparation time prior to cryosectioning and are competitive in terms of labor cost and reagent expenses. **SECTIONING OF FROZEN TISSUES FOR IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION** 1. Frozen tissues prepared as described can be wrapped and stored for many years prior to sectioning, without loss of the mRNA signal. The biggest problem with stored tissue blocks is that they tend to <b>dessicate</b> if not properly wrapped and the O. C. T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound) can be difficult to cut. - Blocks should be removed from the - 70 °C freezer and allowed to equilabrate with the cryostat chamber temperature. Tissues can be cut at any convenient temperature (- 15 to - 35 °C) as needed. Most tissues cut well at - 15 °C (brain, kidney, liver, vessels, muscle, etc.) however fatty or more difficult tissues (adipose tissue, skin, lung) require temperatures as low as - 35 °C or less to obtain good sections. Care should be taken not to touch the face of the slides but handle by the edges only. Frozen sections 5 - 7 µm (thinner is OK but thicker, over 10 µm, may present problems for visualizing mRNA in situ) should be cut, thaw-mounted onto room-temperature slides, and immediately refrozen by placing slides with sections into a slide box (VWR micro slide box # 48444 - 003) with a single dessicant capsule (Humi-Cap see below). When the box is full, place the top on the box and store at - 70 °C. Sections cut and stored with dessicant are stable for in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for most antigens for over 5 years...|$|R
40|$|Liverpool’s {{pivotal role}} in the Atlantic Slave Trade has become <b>dessicated</b> through musealisation, and a {{dominant}} white identity; a situation which {{has resulted in the}} marginalisation of Liverpool’s black population. This thesis is a practice-led exploration into harnessing tonal signifier texts to make a creative intervention into the cultural amnesia surrounding Liverpool’s slaving past. The thesis attempts to suggest an alternate discourse by translating Antony Gormley’s “things which cannot be articulated” into a novel, referencing the politics of civil disobedience, micro nationhood, identity, memory, and texts that engage with Machery’s “ideological necessity” of silence...|$|E
40|$|Researchers tend to {{underestimate}} or ignore {{the importance of}} small animals to the prehistoric diet due {{to the difficulty of}} separating cultural from noncultural faunal debris excavated from sites. Human coprolite analyses (<b>dessicated</b> human feces) indicate prehistoric dietary consumption of small animals. The large number of coprolites analyzed from North America reveals direct ingestion of small animals and indicates that small animal remains from sites indeed reflect human dietary patterns. The coprolites reveal that reptiles, birds, bats, and a large variety of rodents were an important and prevalent component of the prehistoric diet...|$|E
40|$|MANY {{environmental}} factors {{are known to}} influence {{the size of the}} hen's egg, particularly nutrition (Parkhurst, 1933) and temperature (Bennion and War-ren, 1933). Hays (1929) and others have also shown that weight of egg is inherited. Relatively little is known regarding the effect of specific substances on egg size. Riddle and Basset (1916) treated pigeons with alcohol and report that not only was the weight of the yolk in eggs laid during the period of treatment reduced, but the ef-fect lasted for several months. No data were presented for untreated controls. Asmundson (1931) found that feeding hens <b>dessicated</b> thyroid caused them to lay smaller eggs, the effect on the yolk being most consistent. However, the effect in this case persisted for only about a week after thyroid feeding was discontinued and is probably not to be compared with the effect produced by substances such as alcohol. Since it appeared likely that something might be learned regarding the internal fac-tors that normally influence the formation of the egg, the experiments with <b>dessicated</b> thyroid were continued. Six Single Comb White Leghorn females that had been laying for only a short time were selected from the flock of the Univer-sity of Br;. ish Columbia for the first series of tests. The birds were kept in cages and fed grain, a standard laying mash contain-ing a vitamin D potent fish oil, and oyster shell and were given water to drink. All eggs laid were weighed and the weight o...|$|E

30|$|Within New Zealand dense infestations of wildings {{have been}} {{successfully}} controlled in the past {{using a combination of}} a contact desiccant herbicide (15  L ha- 1 diquat (6, 7 -dihydrodipyrido [1, 2 -a: 2 ′, 1 ′-c] pyrazinediium dibromide)) followed by burning (Ray and Davenhill 1991). This treatment was effective as the diquat <b>dessicated</b> the plant tissue and the resulting dry fuel produced a hot burn that killed most of the remaining conifers and viable seed. However, because of risk concerns, fire is no longer an acceptable management option on DOC administered land (P. Willemse, DOC, 2008, pers. comm.). The current practice of spraying with diquat alone is ineffective at controlling most mature wilding conifers (Donald 1982; Gous and Raal 2010).|$|E
