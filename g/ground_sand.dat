5000|$|Dzi stones {{made their}} first {{appearance}} between 2000 and 1000 BC, in ancient India: {{a few hundred}} thousand were supposedly brought back by Tibetan soldiers from Persia or ancient Tajikistan during a raid. The malicious effect of the “evil eye” was taken very seriously by these people. Dzi were considered to counteract the evil eye. The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with “eyes” on them as a “fight fire with fire” form of protection. Artisans used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white line etching with natron, and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance. A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration. The earliest holes were conical and done with solid drill bits drilling from both ends and, hopefully, meeting {{near the center of the}} bead. Very small drill tips of chipped flint were used without abrasives and numerous other materials, regardless of hardness, when used with abrasives. Neolithic era beads were also drilled with hollow, tubular abrasion driven bits of reed and, later, during the Chalcolithic, copper. These drilled a hole with a core of agate inside the tubular drill. Tubular bit holes were parallel walled rather than conical, but also done from both ends. Both methods required arduous work done with a bow drill, with time and effort being determined by hardness of abrasive, from <b>ground</b> <b>sand</b> (quartz) to corundum.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} a simple test method {{that is used}} to optimize the amount of ground crystalline sand of a given fineness that reacts equivalently with hydrated lime (CH) under autoclave conditions. The stimulated pozzolanic reactivity of the inertness of crystalline silica under autoclave curing leads to the formation of various amorphous and crystalline C–S–H structures. A series of 10 mixtures incorporating different proportions of ground crystalline quartz and calcium hydroxide with a water-to-binder ratio of 0. 5 were prepared, cured under autoclave conditions and investigated using XRD, SEM-EDS and FT-IR analyses. A stoichiometric ratio of 1. 32 was found between approximately 57 % ground crystalline silica and 43 % calcium hydroxide. Applying this ratio as a conversion factor, the optimum content of ground crystalline sand required to entirely consume the generated calcium hydroxide in hydrated cement was calculated to produce an optimized autoclaved concrete. Similarly, the amount of the same ground crystalline sand that should be added to cement was successfully obtained. A verification test was conducted using Portland cement paste to assess the validity of the conversion factor. The microstructural analysis of the optimized autoclaved cement paste with 30 % ground crystalline sand reveals the formation of different nano-sized grains of C–S–H with a low Ca/Si ratio of 1. 09. The average compressive strength of the 2. 5 -h autoclaved cement paste with 30 % <b>ground</b> <b>sand</b> displays a value equivalent to that of the 28 -day normally cured cement paste without <b>ground</b> <b>sand.</b> This result confirmed the validity of the current approach, which was supported by the good correlation among the XRD, SEM-EDS and FT-IR results.

40|$|The {{technology}} of aerated concrete {{is a topic}} that is permanently studied and developed because of the incessant demand for a building material which ensures relatively high strength at low volume weight. This bachelor’s thesis examines the influence of replacing a part of sand with another silica material – microsilica. The increase of mechanical strength is expected at the same volume weight. Microsilica contents around 98 % of amorphous silicon dioxide with a high specific surface area that is substantially higher than a specific surface area of a <b>ground</b> <b>sand.</b> The reactivity of silicon dioxide increases with a higher specific surface area and also {{with the creation of}} a mineral tobermorite, which is the keeper of the strength in autoclaved aerated concrete.

30|$|Different {{types of}} phase(s) to ground fault may take place {{with or without}} fault resistance. In {{majority}} of phase-to-ground fault cases, the fault resistances are caused by arcs and tower grounding, and they are generally {{in the range of}} 10 – 20  Ω. However, for some cases the resistances are much higher for example; with live conductor lying on the high resistance <b>ground</b> (<b>sand,</b> rock, cement, etc.). In these cases, the fault current with high fault resistance are small. So majority of the protection algorithms, which are influenced by fault resistance, fails to perform satisfactorily. Thus, it is essential to study the effect of fault resistance on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. In this regard, various fault cases were examined by considering a wide range of the fault resistance. To evaluate the influence of the fault resistance, simulation results for various phase(s) to ground faults with different fault resistances are presented in Table  5. It is clearly observed that the relay detects and classifies the fault within one cycle time (< 16.67  ms) with maximum percentage error of 0.597  % in estimating the fault location.|$|E

The uniaxial compression strength of specimens was measured, and the components in the specimen depending on the curing period were analyzed by means of XRD analysis. The result revealed that higher weight ratios and longer curing period contributed to increased strength of calcium carbonate, cement, and calcium carbonate + cement specimens. The calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate + cement specimens in the same condition showed the tendency of decreased strength approximately 3 times and two times in comparison with the 8 % cement specimens cured for 28 days, but the tendency of increased strength was approximately 4 times and 6 times in comparison with the untreated specimen...|$|E

It appears to have declined in arable field habitats owing to changes in agricultural practices, and in tracks and heath land owing to reduced disturbance. Much of the decline took place before the 1960 s. Population counts for all extant sites between 1993 and 1996 show marked variation from year to year and marked differences between sites. The best conservation management is currently thought to be annual disturbance by digging or rotavation in early autumn.
