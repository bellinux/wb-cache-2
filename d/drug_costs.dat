Davis' campaign featured several negative ads that highlighted Simon's financial fraud scandal. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent.

However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall. Davis won the election, but the majority of voters disliked Davis and did not approve of his job performance.|$|E

Affordable treatment cost {{is a factor}} enfluencing health care coverage and it is usually measured in ability to pay (ATP). Ability to pay is amount of rupiahs that patients should pay for a treatment in primary health care. ATP is calculated equal to 5 % from non foods expenditure. In accordance with 2004 National Social Ekonomic Survey, non foods expenditure included expenditure for house, households, variety goods and usefulness, education cost, health cost, cloths, shoes and cover alurable goods head, tax and insurance,party and ritual ceremony. The prime objective {{of this study was}} to analyze <b>drug</b> <b>cost,</b> treatment cost and ability to pay in primary health care, so as to find the coverage of health care from cost aspect.

The samples were 16, 021 household's members. lnclussion criterion were residents who were out patients one year ago or in patients five years ago in primary health care.

40|$|Introduction: IV {{solution}} wastage {{refers to}} IV medications {{made for a}} patient that remain unused by that patient {{for a variety of}} reasons, and have subsequently expired, or for other reasons cannot be used for another patient (recycled), and therefore must be disposed of. This problem is widespread across hospital pharmacies in the U. S. and the world. BMH-NM (Oxford) pharmacy utilizes many waste reduction strategies but has never monitored its IV solution wastage. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify the number of IV solutions wasted in a month and the subsequent financial loss in terms of <b>drug</b> <b>cost,</b> and categorize the wastage by drug name and drug class. Methods: This study was conducted using a cross-sectional, observational, prospective study design to quantify the amount of IV solution wastage that occurred at BMH-NM (Oxford). For 30 days in March, 2017, the researcher collected data from wasted IV solutions set aside by pharmacy technicians and calculated the <b>drug</b> <b>cost.</b> For each wastage indicator (number of bags and <b>drug</b> <b>cost),</b> the top 10 drugs and drug classes were ranked, and descriptive statistics were conducted to further visualize the impact. Results: From March 1, 2017, to March 30, 2017, the BMH-NM (Oxford) pharmacy wasted 285 bags of IV solution, resulting in a financial loss of $ 4025. 66 in <b>drug</b> <b>cost.</b> There were 46 different types of drugs from 28 different drug classes. Conclusion: The financial loss from a single month of IV solution wastage was significant for a 217 -bed rural hospital. A variety of drugs and drug classes were identified as targets for waste reduction. Potential causes for wastage were drug-specific, and both volume and cost of waste need to be considered for reducing overall IV solution wastage...|$|R
