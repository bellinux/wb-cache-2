5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the <b>distance</b> <b>covered,</b> but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

40|$|We {{tracked the}} daily {{movements}} of three juvenile golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) using satellite telemetry. Straight <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> {{in an hour}} and throughout a day were calculated. Daily movements of golden eagles are mostly characterized by short-distance excursions, with 64 % of the <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> in an hour shorter than 1 km and 95 % shorter than 9 km. Both the longest movements and the largest proportion of long-distance movements, were concentrated between 1100 and 1800 hours, the peak of daily activities. Average hourly distances during that peak oscillated between 2 and 6 km, with records of more than 20 km. <b>Distances</b> <b>covered</b> in a day ranged between 0. 1 and 53. 2 km with an average of 14. 0 km (SD= 13. 4). Differences in the <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> at different times of the day probably reflect a balance between the temporal pattern of preferred prey's activity and the eagles' progressive satiation along the day on one hand, and the higher likelihood of thermal and updraughts (which facilitate long-distance movements) occurring at noon and the early afternoon, on the other. © Dt.

25|$|Corvettes had {{adequate}} endurance for MOEF assignments, but {{the fuel}} economy of destroyers was poor at the speeds that convoys operated.

30|$|The {{cross-country}} {{comparison of}} daily grazing itineraries revealed larger <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> by cattle in Mongolia than in China, likely caused by lower herbage offers in Mongolia {{on the one}} hand and the Chinese regulation of animal numbers per pasture on the other hand. However, differences in daily distances and thus in sizes of theoretical utilized pasture areas between species may be explained by their different foraging preferences and accessibility of pastures. As various authors have reasoned, in particular, topographic features such as steep slopes and high stone cover at the pastures may limit the grazing radius of cattle (Zemmrich et al. 2010; Fujita et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014) as was also observed in the Altay-Dzungarian region. The relatively short <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> by of Chinese cattle during the winter are a result of restricted pasture grounds (pastures near the village and partly fenced pastures) and additional fodder supply in the form of hay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: The use {{of saliva}} for {{monitoring}} metabolic variations in physical exercise {{and in different}} sports gained ground in recent years. Several studies showed that saliva reflects biochemical changes useful for analytical purposes in clinical investigations and in physiological research. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the profile of salivary metabolite changes due to a session of small sided games (SSG) in elite soccer players, searching for a correlation between metabolic changes and athlete performance as GPSmeasured <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> in the match. METHODS: Ten under- 20 elite soccer players participated to the study. The game had an overall duration of 24 min and it consisted of 4 bouts of 6 min duration with 2 min passive recovery between exercise bouts. Saliva samples were collected before and after the game and physiological parameters evaluated, namely the <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> by players and blood lactate. Samples were analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Orthogonal Projection of Latent-Structure (OPLS) was used to process the data. RESULTS: Multivariate data analysis showed that the SSG session affected salivary metabolite levels in players. We observed no relationship between concentrations of hematic and salivary lactate, nor found any changes in the metabolic profiles that correlate with the blood lactate values. Among the identified metabolites, taurine was instead found to correlate with <b>distances</b> <b>covered</b> by players during the game. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether these results point to a potential use of saliva to follow metabolic changes during an athletic competition, and opens the possibility of using this non-invasive biofluid for the study of athlete training state and performance...|$|R
