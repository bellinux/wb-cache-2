500|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> used by American Window Glass {{factories}} {{was created}} by Pittsburgh resident John H. Lubbers, and he continued to contribute improvements to the machine over the next decade. [...] By using the Lubbers machine, human glass blowers were replaced with a <b>machine</b> <b>operator</b> paid 30 percent of the glass blower wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass. [...] Thus, the highest–paid skilled workers in the United States were considered obsolete. In the case of Hartford City, machines replaced most of the human glass blowers by 1908.|$|R
50|$|A step beyond {{mechanization}} is automation. Early production machinery, {{such as the}} <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> (ca. 1890s), {{required a}} lot of operator involvement. By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much less operator attention, were being used.|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest impact}} of early mass {{production}} was in manufacturing everyday items, {{such as at}} the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, USA around 1900. The new automated process used <b>glass</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>machines</b> to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.|$|R
2500|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} began around 1900 when machines, {{aided by}} electric, hydraulic and pneumatic power, began to replace hand methods in industry. [...] An early {{example is the}} Owens automatic <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine,</b> which reduced labor in making bottles by over 80%. [...] See also: Mass production#Factory electrification ...|$|R
500|$|In 1905 American Window Glass sold {{some of its}} smaller plants, {{including}} Hartford City's {{plant number}} 32. [...] Plant number 3 still continued operations. It employed 500 people in 1910. Before the start of World War I, American Window Glass Company was still the dominant window glass manufacturer, accounting [...] for {{over half of the}} nation's window glass manufacturing capacity. [...] In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the <b>glass</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>machines.</b> Plant number 3 was the third largest window glass factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. [...] The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: [...] the glass-blowing machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I.|$|R
2500|$|The first commercially {{successful}} <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was introduced}} in 1905. [...] The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. [...] The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{bottles and}} glass jars {{are in many}} {{households}} around the world. The first glass bottles were produced in south east Asia around 100 BCE, and in the Roman Empire around 1 AD. America's glass bottle and glass jar industry {{was born in the}} early 1600s, when settlers in Jamestown built the first glass melting furnace. The invention of the automatic <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1880 industrialized the process of making bottles.|$|R

50|$|In 1904, Michael Joseph Owens {{received}} the first American patent for an automatic <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine,</b> which transformed the glass bottle and jar industry. The GBBA strongly opposed mechanization, {{but there was}} little they could do to stop new companies from employing the technology. Mechanization turned glassmaking from a skilled profession to an unskilled one. Output tripled, and so many workers were needed that the surplus of apprentices was more than easily absorbed. But as bottle-making became an unskilled profession, the GBBA responded by allowing union wage rates to fall dramatically.|$|R

50|$|Debate arose {{concerning}} {{the morality of}} the system, as workers complained about unfair working conditions prior {{to the passage of}} labour laws. One of the problems concerned women's labour, which in many cases women were paid almost a quarter of what men made. Child labour was also {{a major part of the}} system, and was vehemently argued by those who deemed it immoral. However, in the early 19th century, education was not compulsory and in many families having children work was necessary due to low incomes (Samuel Slater employed children but was required to provide basic education). Children commonly did farm labor and produced goods for the household. Besides working in factories children worked in mines. Automation in the late 19th century is credited with displacing child labor, with the automatic <b>glass</b> bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> (ca. 1890) cited as an example, having been said to do more to end child labor than child labor laws. Years of schooling began to increase sharply from the end of the 19th century.|$|R
