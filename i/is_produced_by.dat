5|$|Europium <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> nuclear fission, but the {{fission product}} yields of {{europium}} isotopes are low {{near the top}} of the mass range for fission products.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> the light-driven {{splitting}} {{of water}} during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% {{of the free}} oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the sound <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace.

5|$|Glycocalyx <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> many {{bacteria}} to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: {{ranging from a}} disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule.

They can also act as antigens and be involved in cell recognition, as well as aiding attachment to surfaces {{and the formation of}} biofilms.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{chemistry}} tends not {{to involve}} π bonding {{due to the}} electron configuration of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the cyclopentadienyl complex La(C5H5)3, which <b>is</b> <b>produced</b> <b>by</b> reacting anhydrous LaCl3 with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran, and its methyl-substituted derivatives.|$|E
