This group is underrepresented in the media and does not attract much research interest. To put this right, we present an analysis of the representation of older persons in advertisements appearing in magazines aimed directly or indirectly at seniors in Spain. A content analysis estimated the frequency of appearance of the images and words that represent the elderly, and a discourse analysis enabled this study to investigate the presence of stereotypes and discourse relations between advertising and theories of ageing. The results show that the older people who appear in the ads are mostly men portrayed as consumers of entertainment products who are {{at the beginning of their}} period of old age. A marked gender stereotype is observed. The differentiation between the <b>institutional</b> and commercial <b>advertising</b> discourse is also clear.

The research is focused on the analysis of the parliamentary initiatives and the corresponding parliamentary debates, with special emphasis on the legislative initiatives prior to the 2005 Law of Advertising and Institutional Communication, and its value as predecessor of other regulations. The first proposal of the law, still rejected, was taken by different political forces as the basis for subsequent regulative proposals concerning <b>institutional</b> <b>advertising.</b> The position of different groups, and their arguments, shows a clear lack of coherence in many cases. The comparison of the different initiatives in different Spanish chambers –and the debates around them- is a first step to establish the policy memory which, beyond the specific case of institutional communication, becomes a very useful instrument in the field of Political Communication...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how gender is portrayed in Chinese television commercials {{and how these}} representations reflect {{the social and cultural}} contexts of their production and the <b>institutional</b> practices of <b>advertising</b> production personnel. To date, while there have been a plethora of studies on gender representation in advertising in western contexts only limited attention has been given to Chinese advertising portrayals of gender. This study, therefore, explores particular ways in which femininity and masculinity are discursively constructed, and how this process, in turn, contributes to reinforcing and/or challenging certain gender ideologies, in particular those found in Chinese Confucian culture. The study is unique in its approach to Chinese television advertising in that it combines methods from textual analysis (quantitative content analysis, semiotic analysis and critical discourse analysis) and empirical research (interview). A sample of 679 television commercials was collected and analysed in this investigation. Content analysis was initially applied to identify recurrent patterns and characteristics of gender representation which, in turn, formed the basis for in-depth semiotic and discourse analysis. Specific signs, images, codes, discourses and myths were subsequently discussed. The study also included semi-structured interviews with 26 Chinese advertising personnel in order to understand their multiple dispositions toward gender and their actual experiences of depicting female and male characters in the creative process. Several main findings emerged from this study. The portrayal of gender in Chinese television commercials is complex because it embodies a series of simultaneously conflicting and complementary discourses on what constitute femininity and masculinity. The results of the content analysis revealed that the representation of gender in this study’s sample still remains stereotypical in terms of the different distribution of the sexes across product category, role, dress, age, credibility and voice-over. By focusing on the constructs of gender in domestic, occupational and recreational contexts, the use of semiotic and discourse analysis revealed that Chinese television advertising not only portrays women and men in line with the significant aspects embedded in both Chinese and western patriarchal traditions, but is also constitutive of cultural shifts in gender ideologies through highlighting modern (western) values. In addition, the interview findings yielded support for the conclusions of textual analysis, demonstrating that the process of advertising production is significantly influenced by traditional and modern gender values, the restriction of advertising regulations, client expectations, and the professionals’ divergent perceptions of gender and their assumptions about the audience...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{research}} that was already completed. lt aims to present some information about private elementary and secondary schools offer in the municipality of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State. The survey covers the period from 1875 to 1910. lt was conducted using <b>institutional</b> <b>advertising</b> content published in the several newspapers that were circulating in the municipality by that time. The survey indicates how private school organization occurred at the turn of 19 th to the 20 th century, focusing specifically on primary and secondary schools, as well as on their curricula frameworks. We can notice that both for secondary and for elementary education, the students' outcomes worked as quality assurance of the educational institution. This fact was widely exploited in the advertisements. In this survey the advertisements make possible the emergence of aspects about private education performance in the constitutional moment of an organized system that was gradually leaving the homes, as a practice of private teaching, to gradually constitute the first private schools.

40|$|Medical {{journals}} {{are published}} by scientific societies, universities, publishing agencies and other for-profit or non-profit organizations. The traditional way {{to cover the}} expenses in printed journals has been a "subscribers pay" model. The rise of electronic versions in the internet, either together with the printed version or replacing it entirely, plus a progressive adherence to an "open access" for electronic versions, has created financial difficulties. Therefore, the "authors pay" model has been added. Both models can be subsidized by commercial or <b>institutional</b> <b>advertising,</b> but still a main source for financing relies either in subscriptions or in authors' payments.

40|$|Jowett and O'Donnell {{observe that}} 'there {{is a clear}} revival of {{interest}} in the important role of propaganda in many aspects of modern life, not necessarily related to international intrigue or military campaigns' (1992, p. xi). This thesis has examined the 1991 Census communication campaign (ABS 1991 a) for evidence of propaganda intentions and strategies. Propaganda is clearly a pejorative term and its application to a particular campaign could imply a covert attempt at manipulation by the authority behind the campaign-the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). As the author was responsible for the development, implementation and evaluation of the 1991 Census communication campaign and had privileged access to a range of sources, a reader might expect detailed references to internal files which reveal conscious decision-making to mount a propaganda campaign. This is not the case. An analysis of the 150 working files associated with the campaign revealed no support for such a hypothesis; {{there was no evidence of}} decision-making with the intent of implementing propaganda strategies. Similarly, during interviews with senior ABS managers, these managers categorically rejected the notion that the Bureau conducted a propaganda campaign and pointed to the fact that all procedures were cleared through both the Federal Parliament and the Privacy Commissioner. The hypothesis explored by this thesis is that despite this lack of conscious direction, propaganda processes are evident in the way the ABS conducted the communication campaign for the 1991 Census. The perspective of the thesis is closely aligned to that of Altheide and Johnson who locate propaganda as the bridge between 'organisational image and reality' (1980, p. 4). Altheide and Johnson regard propaganda as an insidious phenomena based on impression-management through the 'rigorous pursuit of scientifically valid procedures and standards' (1980, p. 229). The end result of this impression-management is that certain 'facts' are presented to the exclusion of all others. This thesis argues that impression-management strategies are evident in the way the ABS conducted the communication campaign for the 1991 Census. The processes of impression-management are subtle and do not reside in such sources as internal files. The process operates through the internalised ethos and corporate values inculcated in the minds of senior staff within the Bureau and is best conceptualised as a mindset, reflected in outcomes. I have used the term mindset to cover the process of converting abstract values into specific guides for action-fora discussion of this process see Hall (1977, pp. 69 - 83). This mindset is well-illustrated by the issue of compulsion-the obligation to complete a census form. At one level the ABS procedures are impeccable: cleared through the federal parliament and the Privacy Commissioner-and it is this form of discourse that is documented in internal files. The procedures do not, however, enable respondents to make an informed decision about whether the census is compulsory and about the ramifications for non-compliance. The mindset operating here is based on the value of the census to the ABS-the census is good for the ABS-it generates revenue and legitimises the role of the organisation. The thesis presents data which establishes that there is a significant gap between the organisational image of the census (in the corporate mind of the ABS) and that perceived by householders. The mindset of the ABS is clearly evident in the procedures adopted on this issue. The main finding of this thesis is that many of the processes underlying the development of the 1991 Census communication campaign were subtle environmental influences. These reflected the internal dynamics of the ABS, and its ability as an institution to control the communication environment through addressing the needs of other major organisations, such as the media, and the release of selective information to specific target audiences. In this context, institutional dynamics, more than decisions by individual managers, influenced the conduct of the campaign. The process of propaganda, therefore, is implicit in the 1991 Census rather than explicit-a distinction, in terms of process, drawn by Pearlin and Rosenberg (1954) in their examination of propaganda techniques in <b>institutional</b> <b>advertising.</b> It should also be acknowledged that whilst the author did have privileged access to information, there is no information contained in this thesis that would not be publicly available. The majority of primary sources are reports published by the ABS or papers delivered by Bureau staff at a range of fora. Permission was sought from the ABS for assistance in obtaining access to information and this was readily granted...|$|E

It was the pleasure and privilege of The Broadway Department Store to furnish this delightful 'country club by-the-sea. ' Surf and Sand Club combines the facilities, comforts, and informality of a country club with the dormitory and indoor athletic features of fine urban clubs. On the first floor is located a wonderful white-tiled warm salt water swimming pool with blue decorations. Also on this floor are the club offices, check room, grill, soda, fountain, cigar and newstand, guest waiting room and bowling alleys. The second floor contains the main dining room and kitchen, a luxurious lounge, drawing room, library, and sun room with an ever-commanding view of ocean and beach. The remaining four upper floors, exclusive of the children's recreation room on the roof, contain 124 bedrooms, many with private porches. The Furniture is of the Spanish Renaissance Period. To harmonize wit hthe rich dark brown oak woodwork of the club, furniture of the Spanish Renaissance period was chosen. Deep upholstering in plain mohair and figured wool tapesty in black, red, yellow and blue designs make an effective and striking contrast. Very New Are The Casement Curtains Of Templar Cloth. Curtainings of Templar cloth in buff color are over-hung by rich orange velour drapes, both being suspended from artistic wrought iron fixtures. Templar cloth is a new, thick, heavy fabric which eliminates the use of window shaded and keeps out the sun's glare. The library shows a slightly different window treatment with Templar cloth curtains and blue striped silk damask hangings. The floor is covered with a soft, deep pile carpeting. The bedrooms have four post walnut beds with incidental pieces to match. The floors are carpeted in black and tan Axminster carpeting. The window outlook is beautified with buff color Templar cloth curtains. When Confronted With a Furnishing or Decorating Problem, Consult Our Corps of Specialists!
