The design didn't look much like a conventional turbojet, resembling more a tiny flat cylindrical box with an <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> {{on one side and}} an exhaust hole on the other. It was expected to have a thrust-to-weight ratio of about 100—incredible compared to any [...] "macroscale" [...] engine but a logical consequence of scaling the technology down in size—and run at about 1.2 million RPM, making bearings a tricky issue. Since it could [...] "spool up" [...] in about a millisecond, it was envisioned as operating in a pulsed mode to conserve fuel and also provide a throttling scheme. A functioning gas turbine was never successfully implemented at this scale after years of development.|$|E

This can be applied to tune the performance of the microphone in the system. Packages with small sound <b>inlet</b> <b>holes</b> are acoustic low-pass filters.

50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide carburettor. Between the float chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|E

Other design parameters of the dispenser were fixed: 100 -μm height of chamber and outlet, 500 -μm diameter of <b>inlet</b> <b>hole,</b> and 1000 -μm diameter of bump structure.

There are also 'Figure 8', 'Bowtie' and 'Bar' burners. Other grills have a separate burner for each control. These burners can be referred to as 'Pipe', 'Tube', or 'Rail' burners.

40|$|A {{continuous}} flow, passive {{separation device}} was designed using an equivalent circuit to create variable flow rates for hydrodynamic focusing to drain channels and collection outlets. By varying {{the diameter of}} the sample inlet connection into the reservoir, the particle position was influenced significantly, which enabled desired separations. Additionally it was noted that the relative, horizontal position of the inlet also had a significant influence on particle position within the device. A dimensionless number, the Characteristic Sample Inlet, was developed to relate geometric properties of the inlet reservoir to downstream particle distribution. It was found that a 2 : 1 ratio between inlet reservoir and sample inlet diameter, and placed {{at the top of the}} reservoir yielded the best separation results. Fluid velocity profiles in the reservoir were explored using Comsol Multyphysics. The experimentally observed particle trajectories and COMSOL predictions were in good agreement. Based on Comsol models a dimensionless parameter to relate the unique velocity profiles within the inlet reservoir to downstream separation of particles was also developed. A mixture of 10, 5. 5, and 3. 0 µm particles were separated to three distinct collection outlets at 73. 4 %, 64. 7 %, and 52. 8 % respectively. Therefore this project shows that passive separations of particles can be achieved simply by alerting the ratio of <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> relative to inlet reservoir diameter, and by placing the <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> at the top of the reservoir...|$|E

The bottom substrate includes a liquid chamber, an <b>inlet</b> <b>hole,</b> and a bump structure that functions as a restrictor during the dispensing process (Figure  1 (b)). The outlet of the dispenser is oriented sideways and is defined by a dicing process of the assembled substrates. The flexible membrane is deflected by the applied pressure, and thus draws in or dispenses liquid. The membrane is either pulled (negative pressure) or pushed (positive pressure) depending on the programmed electric signal. The applied pressure is normally negative; a pulsed signal switches a solenoid valve to provide positive pressure (during duration time) to dispense the liquid. The liquid is drawn into the chamber when the membrane is pulled (during delay time) and dispensed when it is pushed [[24]].|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that the leading edge has the most {{critical}} heat transfer area of a gas turbine blade. The highest heat transfer rates on the airfoil can always {{be found on the}} stagnation region of the leading edge. In order to further improve the gas turbine thermal efficiency the development of more advanced internal cooling configurations at leading edge is very necessary. As {{the state of the art}} leading edge cooling configuration a concave channel with multi inline jets has been widely used in most of the blades. However, this kind of configuration also generates strong spent flow, which shifts the impingement off the stagnation point and weakens the impingement heat transfer. In order to solve this problem a new internal cooling configuration using double swirl chambers in gas turbine leading edge has been developed and introduced in this paper. The double swirl chambers cooling (DSC) technology is introduced by the authors and contributes a significant enhancement of heat transfer due to the generation of two anti-rotated swirls. In DSC-cooling, the reattachment of the swirl flows always occurs in the middle of the chamber, which results in a linear impingement effect. Compared with the reference standard impingement cooling configuration this new cooling system provides a much more uniform heat transfer distribution in the chamber axial direction and also provides a much higher heat transfer rate. In this study, the influences of different geometrical parameters e. g. merging ratio of two cylinder channels, the jet <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> configurations and radius of blunt protuberances in DSC have been investigated numerically. The results show that in the DSC cooling system the jet <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> configurations have large influences on the thermal performance. The rectangular inlet holes, especially those with higher aspect ratios, show much better heat transfer enhancement than the round inlet holes. However, as the price for it the total pressure drop is increased. Using blunt protuberances instead of sharp edges in the DSC cooling can improve the heat transfer enhancement and reduce the total pressure drop...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of sev-eral relevant manufacturing features that might occur for a cooling supply hole being fed by a range of channel configurations. The manufacturing variances included the ratio of the hole diameter to the channel width, the number of channel feeds (segments), the effect of hole overlap with respect to the channel sidewalls, and the channel Reynolds number.

In order to facilitate the research, an air-jet texturing nozzle with a rectangular cross section has been developed. The texturing performance of the nozzles is assessed by means of process observations and on-line measurement of stabilizing zone tension, and also by measuring the in creased linear density of the yams on textured yarn samples. Furthermore, instability, elongation at break, and tenacity are measured, and texturing quality is judged by visual inspections and examination of scanning electron microscopy images of the textured yarns. Tension in the stabilizing zone, increase in linear density, and to a somewhat lesser extent instability are reliable measures of texturing quality. The best texturing comes from nozzles with a slightly diverging main channel and a single air <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> located far from the nozzle exit.

The heat losses from the lateral surface of the PCM tank are modeled using Newton’s law of cooling by prescribing a heat-loss coefficient on the lateral surfaces. The results show that at high heat losses, low thermal efficiencies are realized. Correspondingly larger solar concentrations are required to fully melt the PCM tank. At low heat losses, such as can be expected when using thermal insulation on the lateral surfaces, approximately 40 % thermal efficiency can be realized. The results also demonstrate that a high absorber area:length of PCM tank squared (SR) ratio enables the system to have a high thermal efficiency. For a high-SR, low-heat-loss design case, having a high taper ratio, high area ratio between absorber area and <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> area, and small PCM tank length all achieve higher thermal efficiencies.

The working fluid was water circulating through the injector nozzle under steady-state flow conditions at different flow rates, pressures and needle positions. Simultaneous matching of the Reynolds and cavitation numbers has allowed direct comparison between the cavitation regimes present in real-size and enlarged nozzles. The experimental results from the model injector, as part of a research programme into second-generation direct-injection spark-ignition engines, are presented and discussed. The main objective of this investigation was to characterise the cavitation process in the sac volume and nozzle holes under different operating conditions. This has been achieved by visualizing the nozzle cavitation structures in two planes simultaneously using two synchronised high-speed cameras. Imaging of the flow inside the injector nozzle identified the formation of three different types of cavitation {{as a function of the}} cavitation number, CN. The first is needle cavitation, formed randomly at low CN (0. 5 - 0. 7) in the vicinity of the needle, which penetrates into the opposite hole when it is fully developed. The second is the well known geometric cavitation originating at the entrance of the nozzle hole due to the local pressure drop induced by the nozzle <b>inlet</b> <b>hole</b> geometry with its onset at around CN= 0. 75. Finally, and at the same time as the onset of geometric cavitation, string type cavitation can be formed inside the nozzle sac and hole volume having a strong swirl component as a result of the large vortical flow structures present there; these become stronger with increasing CN. Its link with geometric cavitation creates a very complex two-phase flow structure in the nozzle holes which seems to be responsible for hole-to-hole and cycle-to-cycle spray variations...|$|E

40|$|Turbine design {{engineers}} have {{to ensure that}} film cooling can provide sufficient protection to turbine blades from the hot mainstream gas, while keeping the losses low. Film cooling hole design parameters include inclination angle (a), compound angle (b), <b>hole</b> <b>inlet</b> geometry, and <b>hole</b> exit geometry. The influence of these parameters on aerodynamic loss and net heat flux reduction is investigated, with loss being the primary focus. Low-speed flat plate experiments have been conducted at momentum flux ratios of IR= 0. 16, 0. 64, and 1. 44. The film cooling aerodynamic mixing loss, generated by the mixing of mainstream and coolant, can be quantified using a three-dimensional analytical model that has been previously reported by the authors. The model suggests that for the same flow conditions, the aerodynamic mixing loss {{is the same for}} holes with different a and b but with the same angle between the mainstream and coolant flow directions (angle k). This relationship is assessed through experiments by testing two sets of cylindrical holes with different a and b: one set with k= 35 deg, and another set with k= 60 deg. The data confirm the stated relationship between α, β, k and the aerodynamic mixing loss. The results show that the designer should minimize k to obtain the lowest loss, but maximize b to achieve the best heat transfer performance. A suggestion on improving the loss model is also given. Five different hole geometries (α= 35. 0 deg, β= 0 deg) were also tested: cylindrical hole, trenched hole, fan-shaped hole, D-Fan, and SD-Fan. The D-Fan and the SD-Fan have similar hole exits to the fan-shaped hole but their <b>hole</b> <b>inlets</b> are laterally expanded. The external mixing loss and the loss generated inside the hole are compared. It was found that the D-Fan and the SD-Fan have the lowest loss. This is attributed to their laterally expanded <b>hole</b> <b>inlets,</b> which lead to significant reduction in the loss generated inside the holes. As a result, the loss of these geometries is≈ 50 % of the loss of the fan-shaped hole at IR= 0. 64 and 1. 44. © 2013 by ASME...|$|R
