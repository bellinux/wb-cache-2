40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new concept, green {{organisational}} ambidexterity, that integrates green exploration learning and green exploitation learning simultaneously. Besides, this study {{argues that the}} antecedents of green organisational ambidexterity are <b>green</b> <b>shared</b> vision and <b>green</b> absorptive capacity and its consequents are green radical innovation performance and green incremental innovation performance. The results demonstrate that green exploration learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green radical innovation performance and its two antecedents—green <b>shared</b> vision and <b>green</b> absorptive capacity. In addition, this study indicates that green exploitation learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green incremental innovation performance and its two antecedents—green <b>shared</b> vision and <b>green</b> absorptive capacity. Hence, firms have to increase their <b>green</b> <b>shared</b> vision, <b>green</b> absorptive capacity, and green organisational ambidexterity to raise their green radical innovation performance and green incremental innovation performance...|$|R
