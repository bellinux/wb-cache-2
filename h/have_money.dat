He tells them, however, that unless they <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> they will not be happy. (Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben—"If you don't <b>have</b> <b>money</b> on you"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a man who has been wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from such a terrible sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, Söhnchen, gut—"All right, sonny, all right"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.|$|E

25|$|A 1935 {{article in}} Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed {{interest}} in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in his yard following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not <b>have</b> <b>money</b> to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903 Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Phosphate mining in Nauru {{originally}} made Nauru {{the richest}} per capita {{nation in the}} world. In 1968, the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust (NPRT) was created to invest profits from mining, so Nauru would <b>have</b> <b>money</b> after the mining was exhausted. The owners of the trust purchased a fleet of ships and aircraft, a brewery in the Solomon Islands, hotels around the world, and real estate in Australia, the United States and Britain, which causes the trust to bankrupt. Phosphate exports peaked in 1973 with 2.3 million tonnes, but has decreased to 0.2 million tonnes in 2001. In 2006, mining of a secondary layer of phosphate began.|$|E

With this receipt in hand, passengers could enter through the rear doors of trolleys. In addition, MBTA inspectors with handheld validators were stationed at the busiest stops to deduct money from and verify monthly passes on CharlieCards, also allowing these riders to enter through any door. (Thirty of the handheld readers had been deployed, with an additional 20 coming by the end of January 2007, according to the MBTA.) Persons holding monthly passes could also just enter through any doors. All passengers, even those who entered through the rear doors, were still be required to go {{to the front of the}} train and make payment (or show their receipt) to trolley drivers. MBTA Transit Police conducted random checks to make sure riders had paid their fares.|$|E
25|$|January 1996: A {{listener}} from Penang {{called in}} {{during one of}} Patrick's show to relate his recent experience {{with a member of}} the police force.

500|$|Internationally, Nigeria is infamous for {{a form of}} bank fraud dubbed 419, a type {{of advance}} fee fraud (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) along with the [...] "Nigerian scam", a form of {{confidence}} trick practised by individuals and criminal syndicates. These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to <b>have</b> <b>money</b> he needs to obtain from that bank. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information {{on the premise that}} the money will be transferred to him, and then he'll get to keep a cut. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted. In 2003, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.|$|E

Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor {{for the purpose of}} later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation.
