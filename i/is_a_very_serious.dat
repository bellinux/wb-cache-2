There is a higher prevalence of HIV among women; 20.5% of women have tested positive compared to 13.6% of men. The population between 45–49 years of age are most likely to have AIDS with 35.4% of the residents in that age group testing positive.|$|E
25|$|Anyone who {{can gain}} Administrators access can overwrite, {{override}} {{or change the}} Data Recovery Agent configuration. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> issue, since an attacker can for example hack the Administrator account (using third-party tools), set whatever DRA certificate they want as the Data Recovery Agent and wait. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} a two-stage attack, which is a significantly different scenario than the risk due to a lost or stolen PC, but which highlights the risk due to malicious insiders.|$|E

25|$|Rejecting a work <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> {{action and}} one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, {{in the case of}} games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view is that to issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} value has been met with positive critical response. Silverman praised the film's animation, stating that [...] "the movie is gorgeous, {{and not just}} for theatrical animation." [...] Silverman also praised the cast, most notably Yuri's voice actors. EGMnow also gave high praise to the animation calling it [...] "beautiful and rich" [...] and said [...] "It is top-of-the-line in artwork, artistic style and coloring. The action sequences, though reminiscent of the game, are not repetitive nor silly. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> movie and it was treated as such." [...] The Fandom Post agreed saying [...] "the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful polish to the work." [...] Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com. Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes.|$|E
500|$|Churchill {{first saw}} Chartwell in July 1921, {{shortly before the}} house and estate were to be auctioned. He {{returned}} the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500. He paid £5,000, after his first offer of £4,800, made because [...] "the house {{will have to be}} very largely rebuilt, and the presence of dry rot <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> adverse factor", was rejected. The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at Harrow School in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; [...] "I am very glad indeed to have become the possessor of [...] "Chartwell". I have been searching for two years for a home in the country and the site is the most beautiful and charming I have ever seen". The sale was concluded on 11 November 1922.|$|E

2500|$|Essentially Legio Maria is {{a spirit}} reliant {{religious}} movement. All the adherents respect the spirit as the guide of Legio.

2500|$|Other critics {{assert that}} sexual {{harassment}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> problem, but current views focus {{too heavily on}} sexuality {{rather than on the}} type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at Yale University comments, [...] "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority." [...] Feminist Jane Gallop sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a [...] "split" [...] between what she calls [...] "power feminists" [...] who are pro-sex (like herself) and what she calls [...] "victim feminists", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a perversion of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided {{unanimously}} {{to reject}} a submission by the Crown Office {{which sought to}} limit the scope of Megrahi's second appeal to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007. In January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin in April 2009, the hearing could {{last as long as}} 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined. The second appeal began on 28 April 2009, lasted for one month and was adjourned in May 2009. On 7 July 2009, the court reassembled for a procedural hearing and was told that because of the illness of one of the judges, Lord Wheatley, who was recovering from heart surgery, the final two substantive appeal sessions would run from 2 November to 11 December 2009, and 12 January to 26 February 2010. Megrahi's lawyer Maggie Scott expressed dismay at the delays: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> danger that my client will die before the case is determined." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed {{a lawsuit}} against William Weber (the defense lawyer for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had {{examined}} the house), along with Good Housekeeping magazine, the New York Sunday News and the Hearst Corporation, all of which had published articles related to the hauntings. The Lutzes alleged invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names for trade purposes, and mental distress, and claimed $4.5million in damages. Hoffman, Weber, and Burton immediately filed a countersuit for $2million alleging fraud and breach of contract. The claims against the news corporations were dropped for lack of evidence, and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn U.S. District Court judge Jack B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes' claims and observed in his ruling: [...] "Based on what I have heard, it appears to me that to a large extent the book is a work of fiction, relying in a large part upon the suggestions of Mr. Weber." [...] In the September 17, 1979 issue of People magazine, William Weber wrote: [...] "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." [...] This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> ethical question when lawyers become literary agents." ...|$|E
