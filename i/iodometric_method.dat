Results: Out of 330 samples {{of different types of}} infections, 58 were positive for P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Due to {{a gradual}} {{increase}} {{in the use of}} persulfate as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) oxidant, a simple measurement of persulfate concentration is desirable to analyze persulfate distribution at designated time intervals on/off a site. Such a distribution helps evaluate efficacy of ISCO treatment at a site. This work proposes a spectro photo metric determination of persulfate based on modification of the <b>iodometric</b> titration <b>method.</b> The analysis of absorption spectra of a yellow color solution resulting from the reaction of persulfate and iodide in the presence of sodium bicarbonate reveals an absorbance at 352 nm, without significant interferences from the reagent matrix. The calibration graph was linear in the range of persulfate solution concentration of 0 - 70 mM at 352 nm. The proposed method is validated by the <b>iodometric</b> titration <b>method.</b> The solution pH was at near neutral and the presence of iron activator does not interfere with the absorption measurement. Also, analysis of persulfate in a groundwater sample using the proposed method indicates a good agreement with measurements by the titration method.

The LOOH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentrations of these plant tissues were assessed with the FOX and iodometric assays for the former and a modified TBARS assay for the latter. There was generally good agreement between the FOX and <b>iodometric</b> <b>methods</b> both prior to and following the UV exposure. However, the iodometric assay appeared to have some difficulty in consistently quantifying lower LOOH levels (< 11 3 ̆bcM), whereas the FOX assay measured LOOH concentrations as low as 5 3 ̆bcM. All tissues exhibited UV-induced increases in TBARS, indicating a marked degree of cellular oxidation in the exposed tissue segments. Compared with the iodometric assay, the FOX method consistently generated less variable LOOH values. The presence of authentic linoleic acid 2 ̆ 212 OOHs in spiked avocado and spinach samples (11 3 ̆bcM) was identified with liquid chromatography 2 ̆ 212 mass spectrometry techniques, which validated corresponding FOX assay results.
