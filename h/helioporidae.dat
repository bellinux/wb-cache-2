50|$|Blue coral (Heliopora coerulea) is {{a species}} of colonial coral and the only species in the family <b>Helioporidae</b> and the only Octocoral known to produce a massive {{skeleton}}. This skeleton is formed of aragonite, {{similar to that of}} scleractinia. Individual polyps live in tubes within the skeleton and are connected by a thin layer of tissue over the outside of the skeleton. It was described by Pallas in 1766.|$|E
50|$|The {{blue coral}} (Heliopora coerulea), the only {{species in the}} family <b>Helioporidae,</b> is most common in shallow water of the {{tropical}} Pacific and Indo-Pacific reefs. It has no , {{and is the only}} octocoral known to produce a massive skeleton formed of fibrocrystalline aragonite fused into lamellae, {{similar to that of the}} Scleractinia (stony corals). They form large colonies that can exceed a meter in diameter. They are composed of vertical branches, or folia.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding what {{variety of}} {{blue or green}} {{branching}} coral was identified as this [...] "mineralized subaqueous shrub" [...] langgan. Since {{it must have been}} a coral attractive enough to be comparable with the extravagant myths of Kunlun, Schafer suggests considering the blue coral Heliopora coerula. It is the only living species in the family <b>Helioporidae,</b> the only octocoral known to produce a massive skeleton, and was found throughout Pacific and Indian Oceans, although the IUCN currently considers it a vulnerable species (1978: 32).|$|E
40|$|Transported coral blocks {{scattered}} on reef flats have previously {{been identified as}} useful proxies for past storm occurrences. High-precision TIMS U-series dating and detailed field observations of 110 coral samples collected from 102 individual transported coral colonies (coral blocks) and 4 transported sections of reef matrix (reef blocks) from the northern side of Heron Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef) indicate that: (1) the youngest age of corals attached to reef blocks may represent the age of possible past storm occurrence, providing a proxy for historical storm reconstruction; (2) most ages of dated storm-transported coral and reef blocks match well relatively with known cyclone and storm events, further supporting that they are good indicators of past storm events; and (3) age distribution and relative probability frequency analysis of the dated coral and reef blocks suggest {{that there have been}} eight broad periods of storm occurrence since 1900 AD (1904 - 1909, 1914 - 1916, 1935 - 1941, 1945 - 1960, 1965 - 1967, 1976 - 1977, 1983 - 1988 and 2001 - 2007), roughly showing decadal variations. The coral-based storm reconstruction therefore extended the database of past storm occurrences around Heron Reef area. These findings suggest that coral reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef are frequently influenced by periods of high storm activity, and show strong resilience to natural disturbances over the past century. Additionally, our results show {{for the first time that}} the blue skeletal coral Heliopora coerulea (Order: Helioporacae) has U concentrations of only 0. 12 to 0. 30 ppm, similar to 5 - 10 % that of common reef building corals with white skeletons (Order: Scleractinia), which may be a unique chemical signature of the only living species of the <b>Helioporidae</b> family.
