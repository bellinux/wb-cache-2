5|$|Although Johnson was {{recruited}} by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, {{he decided to}} play close to home. His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.|$|E
5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he scored}} 129 {{points for the}} Warriors in 1986–87, Fleury's small stature led many teams to doubt that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> in the NHL. The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Upon {{completing}} his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship.|$|E
50|$|Blizzard <b>could</b> <b>play</b> {{anywhere}} {{across the}} midfield, though preferring {{a central role}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> as an attacking or defensive midfielder. He had {{been described as a}} skilled passing footballer.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> only <b>play</b> the few last {{minutes of}} the {{friendly}} match against Haiti, at the Estadio Cuscatlán.|$|R
50|$|Lee was Footscray's full-back in the 1961 VFL Grand Final, {{which they}} lost. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> across halfback.|$|R
5|$|In July, {{the team}} {{reclassified}} Max Bielfeldt from a redshirt junior to a senior, which freed up Bielfeldt's scholarship for the Class of 2015, implying Bielfeldt would play his {{final year of}} eligibility elsewhere. In November, Beilein announced that the team would redshirt Andrew Dakich so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> a fifth year somewhere else. However, a pair of January backcourt injuries caused Dakich's services to be needed and he played instead of redshirting. D. J. Wilson missed {{most of the season}} due to a knee injury and was redshirted.|$|E
5|$|When {{he first}} {{displayed}} this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian {{accused him of}} disrespect. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he had to prove that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> to a high level with his left hand. He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
50|$|When {{advancing}} tuberculosis {{started to}} make his breathing difficult, Hardy taught himself banjo so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue <b>playing</b> music.|$|R
50|$|Ceri Jones is {{a former}} Welsh {{international}} rugby union player. Normally a loose-head prop <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> tight-head prop.|$|R

5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, but felt that it gave him an opportunity to show <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E
5|$|Bywater {{began playing}} {{wheelchair}} basketball {{at the age}} of 13 at an open day in Middlesbrough with the Teesside Lions. He later played with them. After playing for a year, he was selected for the Great Britain Under-23 team and began training in 1993. He made his debut at the Sydney 2000 Summer Paralympics, and finished fourth. He participated in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, where he won a bronze medal, and was the top Great Britain scorer in the event. He currently plays for the Sheffield Steelers. He once played for C. D. Fundosa in Spain, along with many other European clubs. Bywater returned to England so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> with the Super League Club Sheffield Steelers throughout the 2011—12 season. He is a 4.5 point player.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
50|$|Whoopi Goldberg was {{initially}} considered for Lesley Ann Warren's role; however, Brooks was uncertain whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> convincingly <b>play</b> her love interest.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, he {{soon found}} work playing for vacationers as they sailed around Lake Erie on the {{excursion}} boat Goodtime. This gig lasted every summer from 1935 to 1939. During the off- season, Katz found what work <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>playing</b> various one-night gigs. When the Goodtime {{went out of}} business in 1939, he moved on to a position as bandleader and MC at the Ohio Villa gambling palace.|$|R
50|$|Although he was chiefly a midfielder, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> in defence and {{was often}} {{drafted into the}} rearguard {{alongside}} the likes of Craig Levein.|$|R
5|$|During 1930, Allen again had {{leave in}} which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> cricket, and {{was among the}} front-runners for {{a place in the}} England team. His first {{appearance}} of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 194041, Miller was granted leave so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> interstate cricket. In a season {{shortened}} due to war, Miller played in three matches and scored 140 runs at 28.00. In the second match, which was against South Australia, Miller scored 63, his only fifty of the summer, and bowled {{for the first time}} at first-class level, conceding three runs from a solitary over. In the third match he took his maiden first-class wicket, in a war fundraising match for Stan McCabe's XI against Don Bradman's XI, that of Ken Ridings, caught behind with wicket-keeper Don Tallon. His pace was noticed by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
50|$|Facundo Hernán Quiroga (born 10 January 1978) is an Argentine retired {{professional}} footballer. Mainly {{a central}} defender, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> {{in the right}} flank.|$|R

50|$|Pascal Cygan (born 29 April 1974) is a French retired footballer. His favoured {{position}} was central defender, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> as a left back.|$|R
5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|E
5|$|Many of the film's {{actors were}} unknown {{at the time}} of casting. The film was the acting debut of four cast members; Ken Wahl, Tony Ganios, Erland van Lidth and Michael Wright. It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem, who had {{previously}} acted on television. Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors; Wahl {{was on his way to}} a job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin, thinking <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> one of the smaller roles in the film. Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{uncertain}} future continued to dog him, and Rawtenstall expressed their displeasure at their recruit's apparent refusal to fulfil his contract. Miller had privately {{decided that he}} would not go through with the deal, but was refusing to inform the Lancastrian club. In the meantime, he had various job proposals, which he spurned until privately receiving a contract offer from the manager of North Sydney Cricket Club. The proposed deal would give him a subsidy for the costs of his relocation to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman, and gave him generous leave conditions so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> sport.|$|E
50|$|His prowess was {{noticed by}} England coach Bobby Robson who, {{establishing}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> at right back, {{gave him his}} international debut against Albania in 1989.|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E
5|$|When David O'Leary {{replaced}} Graham {{as manager}} {{it became clear}} that his centre-back pairing of choice would be Lucas Radebe and the 18-year-old Jonathan Woodgate, so Wetherall decided to leave Leeds for a club where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> regular first-team football. A transfer to nearby Huddersfield Town fell through after terms had been agreed, and the player's reluctance to move house while wife Caroline was heavily pregnant with their second son caused him to reject an offer from Southampton. After eight years with Leeds, having scored 18 goals from 250 games in all competitions, he accepted an offer from fellow West Yorkshire club Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{had a good}} {{technique}} for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>play</b> attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen.|$|E
50|$|Ernest John Yard (3 May 1941 - November 2004) was a Scottish {{professional}} footballer, {{who played}} as a forward or winger. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also <b>play</b> {{as a full}} back.|$|R
