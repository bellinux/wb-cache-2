5|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and proposals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to convert the former international station to domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 {{to be used by}} South West Trains suburban services. However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it would require alterations to the track layout outside the station.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E

5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only way to stop the Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.|$|E

25|$|Electrowinning, {{also called}} electroextraction, is the {{electrodeposition}} of metals from their ores that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> solution via a process {{commonly referred to}} as leaching. Electrorefining uses a similar process to remove impurities from a metal. Both processes use electroplating on a large scale and are important techniques for the economical and straightforward purification of non-ferrous metals. The resulting metals are said to be electrowon.|$|E
25|$|Objections to {{replacement}} of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate {{the effects of}} these concerns, various programs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and dimmable types are available.|$|E
25|$|The {{level and}} {{severity}} of police brutality in Greece {{over the last few}} years has been quite alarming and surprising.

Greek citizens have opposed these austerity measures from the beginning, showing their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has increased significantly, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.|$|E

25|$|One {{example is}} the Church Rock uranium mill spill on Navajo Nation.

Two sets of five-year clean up plans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place by US Congress, but contamination from the Church Rock incident has still not been completely cleaned up. Today, uranium contamination from mining during the Cold War era remains throughout the Navajo Nation, posing health risks to the Navajo community.|$|E
25|$|The station {{features}} nine platform tracks, {{of which}} seven {{are in the}} station hall. In the hall, two tracks serve as through tracks for freight traffic. The station is electrified since 1964 and has been thoroughly modernised during the late 1990s. Both the passenger and mail subways, {{which used to be}} separate, were joined together and the station's subway now features a rich selection of shops and food halls, akin to a shopping mall. The platforms have been partly modernised as well (most notably platforms 5 and 6, which carry most of the southbound long distance traffic), and lifts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E

25|$|Due to this species' high {{forensic}} interest, {{extensive research}} on its lifecycle {{has already been}} conducted. Medically, however, research is ongoing centered on the secretions produced by L. sericata as an agent against MRSA and VRSA, and the larval applications for maggot therapy. In a new antimicrobial agent was isolated from L. sericata secretions and patented under the name Seraticin. Efforts in the latter are geared toward making medical professionals more familiar to the current techniques. Like many other ectoparasites, L. sericata has a huge economic impact on farmers, so many studies and research projects <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place since the late 1980s to help farmers reduce their impact.|$|E

Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal.

25|$|From 2015 to the present, a {{widespread}} program to improve cities and other settlements {{has been taking}} place. It includes the removal of litter from towns, villages, and many roadsides.

Towns are being improved with new road and sidewalk surfaces, landscaping features are being created, and many buildings are receiving new façades. This initiative in Haikou has seen entire neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, sanitation improved, illegal structures used for business removed, roadside vendors banned, roads and sidewalks replaced, and new street crossings with traffic lights installed.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, a {{group of}} {{particles}} known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>in,</b> the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.|$|E
