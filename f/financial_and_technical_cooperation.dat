She supervised the execution of 22 national programs involving training, credit and marketing (credit portfolio US $200 million). She reorganized the Minister's Bureau for greater teamwork and productivity, and designed coordination strategies among three major public institutions in the sector, eliminating duplications of services and contradictions in policy.|$|E
40|$|The European Union {{has several}} {{policies}} to develop poor countries, which cannot overcome their deficits alone. Official aid {{is far from}} the target of 0. 7 % of' GNP, at 0. 25 % in OECD countries and falling. Europe has preferential trade agreements and also <b>financial</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> However a conflict with the USA has arisen whether these agreements follow WTO males. In addition to trade, Europe has urgent humanitarian aid and external solidarity which amounts to 10 % of the EU budget, four times less than evpenditure on common agricultural policy. The European Union is coordinating with European governments and with international agencies to improve the good use of aid.

40|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the Lome Agreement, the {{negotiations}} for its renewal in the year 2000 supply the occasion for the European Union to reformulate the whole of {{its relations with the}} ACP countries in light of more experience and in consonance with the changes that have occurred in the greater international context. Also important for thenegotiations to consider are the changes now taking place in the evolutionary process of European integration plus the increasing heterogeneity of European members. In 1997, the European Union issued the Green Book, which analyzes and lays the groundwork for a dialogue centered around five major themes: the political dimension of association; the framework for Cooperation and its geographical extent; the spheres and priorities of action; the subject of commerce and investments; and the need for <b>financial</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The text brings together the three major areas of EU foreign action —the common commercial policy, Cooperation for development, and the CFSP— by establishing a series of priorities framed within a global perspective. The Green Bookís aim is to integrate ACP countries in the global economy at the same timeaction is taken to foment integration of their populations in Europe. While it points to some objectives, it leaves options open: it also establishes a work program in which the communities institutions and those of the member States as well as those from the ACP countries have, by way of consultation and conferences, identifies the points of conflict about which the negotiations will turn...|$|E

40|$|The EU Lisbon Treaty 2007 (LT) brings {{some changes}} for the common {{commercial}} policy (CCP) and the decision-making processes related to it. CCP is newly included in the one area with all the external activities of the EU, with foreign and security policy, international environmental policy, development aid and economic, <b>financial</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> with third countries. The fundamental areas of the CCP have been expanded to include foreign direct investment, services and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. The EU’s exclusive competence for external negotiation of agreements in areas of exclusive competence and internal CCP regarding their implementation were confirmed. The changes affect {{the role of the}} European Parliament and also the functioning of the European Council, the Council, and competences of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European External Action Service. Together with these changes, there will be also changes in procedures within the European Union. A number of aspects of the decision-making process are not yet entirely clarified, and only the practice of the participation of the EU Member States and the European Parliament {{in the formation of the}} common commercial policy will bring more meaningful conclusions. The changes brought by the LT will affect not only the extent of the influence of EU Member States on the common commercial policy, but they can also affect the position of the EU in the context of international trade, particularly in the area of negotiating commitments and rules of multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements...|$|E
40|$|A major {{cornerstone}} {{on the way}} to low-carbon {{sustainable development}} on a global scale will be a swift and effective implementation of all countries' INDCs submitted to the UNFCCC prior to Paris. However, doing so will require transforming development pathways away from currently pervasive carbon lock-ins. This can only be successful if countries take a systemic view on their development agendas, and link mitigation, adaptation and other developmental priorities together for a coherent overarching sustainable development strategy. The ownership for this process needs to be with the countries themselves as such strategies touch fundamentally upon national policy-making and implementation. At the same time, developing countries have access to bi- and multilateral <b>financial</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> To enable a systemic, country-led perspective, development cooperation needs to shift its paradigms away from currently prevalent project-level interventions. A truly innovative and transformational shift with the objective of pursuing a low-carbon and climate resilient society needs to open up space for experimentation as new ways of doing things need to be put into practice. Experiments will not always be successful, but foster learning on a national as well as an international level on pitfalls and solutions in new approaches to low-carbon sustainable development. Not least, {{there needs to be a}} renewed focus on programmatic approaches that link various topical domains for a country-led process, and a critical look at development work that is "doomed to succeed". Our article draws from systems theory, development studies and recent work on transitions studies and transformational change in the international domain. It links up different theoretical concepts with practical approaches in order to outline a future development agenda that will be owned by developing countries and supported non-invasively by bi- and multilateral development cooperation to foster low-carbon development pathways that are urgently needed to solve the climate crisis...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se de uma pesquisa de natureza teórica documental, que analisa o movimento recente de articulação entre Governo Federal, representado pelo Ministério da Educação, e os demais entes federados, que em colaboração buscam empreender políticas educacionais frente às atuais demandas. Especificamente, o estudo se volta para o Plano de Ações Articuladas – PAR, instrumento do planejamento pelo qual se desenvolve um diagnóstico da situação educacional nas diferentes localidades e em consonância se estabelece ações e subações para as quais são ofertadas assistência técnica e financeira por parte do Governo Federal para os sistemas estaduais e municipais de ensino. Nesse sentido, o objetivo central deste trabalho {{consiste}} em identificar e analisar a cooperação técnica e financeira ofertada pelo Ministério da Educação a partir das ações e subações sugeridas pelo Plano de Ações Articuladas – PAR em municípios paulistas priorizados pelo Plano. A análise se construiu por meio da descrição do Plano de Ações Articuladas e da análise do aparato legal que o institui e regulamenta; e da identificação e análise das noções que fundamentam a proposta de planejamento contida no PAR. Tomamos inicialmente para análise o relatório público do Plano de Ações Articuladas dos dezessete municípios paulistas prioritários, no ano de 2007, para análise do seu diagnóstico da dimensão da área de Gestão Democrática do ensino. Dentre esses dezessete municípios foram selecionados aqueles que apresentavam menor desempenho na avaliação dos indicadores que compunham o diagnóstico e, portanto, demandaram maior assistência. As conclusões apontam para a importância de implantar medidas com vistas à cooperação entre os entes federados para empreender as políticas educacionais, nas quais os municípios, esferas [...] . This {{thesis is}} a research based on documents that analyses the recent movements of coordination between the Brazilian Federal Government, represented by the Ministry of Education, and the Brazilian states and municipalities, which together seek to undertake educational policies given current demands. Specifically, the study turns to the Articulated Action Plan (Plano de Ações Articuladas – PAR), planning instrument by which it’s developed a diagnosis of the educational situation in different localities and by mutual agreement it’s established actions and subactions for which it’s offered technical and financial assistance by the Federal Government {{to the state and}} municipality systems of education. In this sense, the goal of this thesis is to identify and analyse the <b>financial</b> <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>cooperation</b> offered by the Ministry of Education from the actions and subactions suggested by the Articulated Action Plan - PAR in municipalities from São Paulo state prioritized by the Plan. The analysis is built through the description of the Articulated Action Plan and analysis of the legal framework that establishes and regulates it, and identification and analysis of the concepts that lay the foundation of the planning proposal contained in the PAR. We first review the public report of the Articulated Action Plan for the seventeen municipalities prioritized in São Paulo state in the year 2007, for analysis of its diagnosis of the teaching Democratic Management dimension. Among these seventeen municipalities it was selected those which had a lower performance in the indicators evaluation that comprised the diagnosis and, therefore, required further assistance. The findings point to the importance of implementing measures towards the cooperation among the actors to undertake educational policies, in which municipalities [...] .
