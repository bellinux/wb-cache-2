40|$|The {{decline of}} {{pulmonary}} function {{is the major}} cause of mortality for patients with cystic fibrosis due to bacteria infections, such as infection with P. aeruginosa. This essential pathogen generates a biofilm in the lungs during chronic infections. Biofilms are associations of microorganisms, which adhere on an abiotic and biotic surface and are enclosed from extracellular components such as polysaccharides, proteins and DNA. This protects the bacteria against antimicrobial substances. Current in-vitro assays showed an insufficient representation of the in-vivo situation, because they refer to bacteria growth in planktonic environment. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} bachelorthesis was to establish an in vitro biofilm-assay for testing the efficiency of antibiotics and to compare this assay with the traditional method of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Furthermore, it was to investigate whether it is possible to determine the vitality of the pathogens also by measuring the respiratory activity (Resazurin-Assay und CTC-Assay). P. aeruginosa PAO 1 and ATCC 9027 were used for in vitro biofilm-assay, cultivated into 96 -well plates for 24 hours and treated with different concentrations of Ceftazidim and Tobramycin for additional 24 hours. Afterwards the biofilm was resuspended and the viable count was determined through a <b>dilution</b> <b>streak</b> and compared with MIC-assay. The results of the MIC-assay demonstrate that the bacteria were inhibited through Ceftazidim and Tobramycin. The in vitro biofilm-assay reflects that the bacteria treated with a high concentration of Ceftazidim (10 mg/ml) indicated a pronounced vitality. Tobramycin inhibited the growth of bacteria in biofilms. However, a higher antibiotic-concentration is required for MIC-assay. The comparison of in vitro biofilm- and MIC-assays demonstrate that higher antibiotic-concentrations are necessary to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Thus the in vitro biofilm-assay is better to verify the efficiency of antibiotics to infections with biofilms. The Resazurin- and CTC-assay is not suitable, because different strains indicated high differences in permeability...|$|E

Biosludge was chosen as a possible source as it is produced in situ en masse and contained a large mass fraction of nitrogen (2. 8 % g/g). Biosludge was pre-treated with acids, bases and ultrasonication prior to experiments to determine an effective method for nutrient leaching. Acid pre-treatment showed promising results and was chosen as a suitable method for further development during this project. A screening {{was performed}} to evaluate the effect of heat and time versus leached nutrient concentrations from biosludge in HCl-solutions. The results indicated that a high temperature, 120 °C and a long reaction time, 24 h, reached the highest concentrations of NH 4 + (19 mg/l) and PO 43 - (60 mg/l). The highest concentration of NO 3 - was 64 mg/l, reached after 170 h at 25 °C. The volume was kept constant during all leaching experiments.

(Biotechnology) Abstract: The {{petroleum}} industry contributes significantly in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as carbon dioxide which amounts to 97. 67 % {{of the total}} GHG emission during production while methane contributes about 2. 25 % and nitrous oxide contributes about 0. 08 %. Greenhouse gases are a major cause for drastic climate changes facing the world today. The {{effects of climate change}} are quite visible as the world is experiencing an increase in the average global temperature, accelerated melting of icebergs during summer and unusual precipitation patterns. These effects of climate change may affect the ecosystems as their effects are life threating. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and identify microorganisms that inhabit petroleum refinery waste water and to assess their ability to hydrolyse complex hydrocarbons present in crude oil to simpler hydrocarbons found in refined petroleum. Five bacterial strains were isolated using serial <b>dilutions,</b> spread and <b>streaked</b> plate techniques. Colonies were selected based on colony morphology and Gram stain characteristics. Characterization of bacteria was accomplished by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. According to sequencing data, the isolates were identified as Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus warneri, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Acinetobacter tandoii and Bacillus sp. These microorganisms were inoculated in minimal salt media containing 5 % of crude oil at pH 7 and temperature 30 oC at 140 rpm in a shaking incubator in order to study microbial degradation patterns [...] The biodegradation studies were carried over a period of five days and a volume of 1 mL of sample was aseptically drawn from the flasks on each day of the incubation period. Bacterial cells were removed using 0. 22 μm filters. The breakdown products of crude oil were solubilized by adding 1 ml of chloroform into 1 mL of the sample. Biodegradation products were analysed by GCxGC-ToF-MS and show that all the isolates were capable of hydrolysing the crude oil. A. tandoii was the most efficient microorganism amongst the 4 isolates as it was the only isolate that was able to transform high molecular weight hydrocarbons (C 30 and above) and produced significant amounts of new compounds whereas C. amalonaticus and S. warneri could only transform short and medium chain hydrocarbons (C 1 -C 20), B. thuringiensis was able to transform compounds with chain lengths ranging between C 1 and C 30. From these observations A. tandoii and B. thuringiensis would be more applicable in bio-refining of crude oil as they are able to transform medium and heavy molecular weight hydrocarbons into short chain hydrocarbons which are normally found in refined petroleum hydrocarbons such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel...|$|R
