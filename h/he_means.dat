5|$|It is {{announced}} {{that there will}} be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy, leaving her to take Homer's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison, releasing the prisoners. Therefore, Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie. He tears up Bart's ticket to prove that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> business. Bart begs to be given another punishment, but Homer refuses. After the film's release, Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield who has not seen it. Two months later, the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough. However, Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick. Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by paying for a ticket, but learns that Homer went to the theater and instructed the employees to not sell tickets to him. Eventually, the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won, to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart is in no doubt headed for a better life.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{is placed}} under guard in quarters. McGivers {{is sent to}} brief him on current events. Taking {{advantage}} of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over Enterprise. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to Botany Bay, where he revives {{the rest of his}} people. They return to Enterprise and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy Enterprise, but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk pulls an odd rod-like tool (never seen before or since, in this episode or the entire series) from a wall and uses it as a club to knock the superman unconscious.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introduction}} to the Budget of Paradoxes De Morgan explains what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by the word.|$|E
6000|$|Trevennack knit his brows. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> then, by dogging my steps?" [...] he cried. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> {{by coming}} after {{me up to}} London like this? What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by tempting me? I can't stand the sight of him. I won't be challenged, Lucy; I don't know whether it's the devil or not, but when I saw the fellow to-day I had hard work to keep my hands off him. I wanted to spring at his throat. I {{would have liked to}} {{throttle}} him!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} again. She brooded. What did <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He</b> was so wearying. There was {{something}} he would not yield. Yet she must be patient with him.|$|R
60|$|Nor does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> merely {{when we were}} {{children}} in age. The Greek word which <b>he</b> uses, <b>means</b> infants, people not come to years of discretion. Indeed, the word which <b>he</b> uses <b>means</b> very often a simpleton, an ignorant or foolish person; one who does not know who and what he is, what is his duty, or how to do it.|$|R
25|$|David Aberbach {{argues that}} much of the Jewish diaspora, by which <b>he</b> <b>means</b> exile or {{voluntary}} migration, originated with the Jewish wars which occurred between 66 and 135 CE.|$|E
25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, {{it is helpful to}} understand what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 2008, Flair {{was honored}} in Congress by a {{representative}} from North Carolina, Republican Sue Myrick, who praised his career and what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to the state. On September 29, 2008, {{it was announced that}} Flair's signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.|$|E
60|$|Warn. Heaven! {{what does}} <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to do? It {{is not fair}} writ out, sir.|$|R
60|$|Hers to decide? How {{was that}} possible? What could <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> She pressed him with some such questions.|$|R
6000|$|Ibid. [...] "Were not a {{great number}} {{deprived}} by parliament upon the Restoration?" [...] Does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> presbyters? What signifies that? ...|$|R
25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires that businesses continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” by which <b>he</b> <b>means</b> {{that what was}} a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E
25|$|Reward and punishment, {{supplemented}} by future retribution, are, in his view, the sanctions {{of the laws}} of nature, the sources of our obligation to obey them. To the other great ethical question, How are moral distinctions apprehended?, he replies that it is by means of right reason. But by right reason <b>he</b> <b>means</b> merely the power of rising to general laws of nature from particular facts of experience. It is no peculiar faculty or distinctive function of mind; it involves no original element of cognition; it begins with sense and experience; it is gradually generated and wholly derivative.|$|E
25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does not mean to knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E
60|$|The others stood bewildered. What did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to do? <b>He</b> {{turned to}} Hans and {{his blue eyes}} shone like steel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand," [...] Dolores faltered. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> Phil? Naming animals. What kind of animals? Where are we going?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lawford peered as if {{out of a}} {{gathering}} dusk, that thickened and flickered with shadows before his eyes. 'What's <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> then,' <b>he</b> muttered huskily, 'coming here with his black, still carcase--peeping, peeping--what's <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> I say?' There was a moment's silence. Then with lifted brows and wide eyes that to {{every one of his}} three witnesses left an indelible memory of clear and wolfish light within their glassy pupils, he turned heavily, and climbed back to his solitude.|$|R
25|$|The word utility {{is used to}} mean general {{well-being}} or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is {{the consequence}} of a good action. Utility, {{within the context of}} utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing {{should be viewed as}} more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; they should also be seen as “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends that we think first of literacy in terms of semiotic domains. By this, <b>he</b> <b>means</b> “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of semiotic domains, including (but certainly not limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} method applied to consciousness {{gives us the}} science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which <b>he</b> <b>means</b> inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, {{on the one hand}} from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.|$|E
6000|$|It needed all Cecilia's subtlety to {{hide her}} consternation. End to what? Did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>he</b> and B. were going to separate? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{make out}} a word of his cursed brogue,' said the Cumbrian justice; 'can you, neighbour--eh? What can <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by DEFT?' ...|$|R
60|$|Elfride {{glanced at}} Knight with misgiving. Did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> her? She {{could not see}} his features; but his {{attitude}} seemed to show unconsciousness.|$|R
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to find the truth.|$|E
500|$|Early sources {{agree that}} Ine {{was the son}} of Cenred, and that Cenred {{was the son of}} Ceolwald; further back there is less agreement. Ine's {{siblings}} included a brother, Ingild, and two sisters, Cuthburh and Cwenburg. Cuthburh was married to King Aldfrith of Northumbria, and Ine himself was married to Æthelburg. Bede tells that Ine was [...] "of the blood royal", by which <b>he</b> <b>means</b> the royal line of the Gewisse, the early West Saxon tribal name.|$|E
500|$|As a {{free agent}} after the 2005 season, Hoffman re-signed with the Padres after {{negotiating}} with the Cleveland Indians. Hoffman signed a $13.5 million, two-year contract that included a club option for 2008. [...] "It came down to me making a decision for my family and not disrupting what we have going on", said Hoffman. [...] "This is probably the most significant signing that I've had", said then-Padres general manager Kevin Towers. [...] "This guy is the face of our organization. I can't put into words what <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to our community." ...|$|E
5000|$|For this {{he gives}} Mageoghegan. Which Mageoghegan does <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> Connell or the Abbe? Can any {{authority}} {{be found for}} this, earlier than Mageoghegan? ...|$|R
6000|$|The Duchess {{could not}} explain herself, and thought that she had better drop that topic. [...] "What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to do now, Arabella?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you remain}} there, Sir!' {{repeated}} Mr Dombey, turning {{a little more}} round towards him. 'What do you <b>mean?</b> What does <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> Carker?' ...|$|R
500|$|The first reptilian-human {{breeding}} programmes took place 200,000–300,000 years ago (perhaps creating Adam), {{and the third}} (and latest) 7,000 years ago. The hybrids of the third programme, more Anunnaki than human, today control the world: [...] "The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modern expression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-Aryan priests and 'royalty' which came together there after the flood." [...] By [...] "Aryan" [...] he explains that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> [...] "white"; this includes most Jews, whom he regards as having originated in the Caucasus.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{refused to}} print the {{advertisement}} from the Pig-faced Lady's would-be suitor, and donated his £1 fee to The Marine Society. An anonymous letter-writer to the Times continued the comparison with Joanna Southcott, who had claimed {{that she would}} give birth to the Messiah in October 1814, speculating that [...] "the present miss piggy" [...] was perhaps Southcott's child, [...] "brought into {{the world in a}} state of complete puberty". The letter-writer also ridiculed the [...] "swinish Lothario" [...] who hoped to marry the Pig-faced Lady, suggesting that [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to have her, he must woo her in grunts".|$|E
500|$|Klaatu {{meets with}} another alien, Mr. Wu, {{who has lived}} on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive, {{stubborn}} and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that <b>he</b> <b>means</b> to save the Earth from destruction by humankind. [...] When a policeman attempts to take them into custody, Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer, telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.|$|E
60|$|Joan flushed. What did <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by cross-examining {{her in this}} way? She was not at {{all used}} to {{impertinence}} from the opposite sex.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother speaks strangely to-day," [...] {{replied the}} chief. [...] "His words are hidden from his Indian friend. What does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by `her'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shames Tougall," [...] said Donald Bane, in an undertone, {{and with}} the {{deliberate}} slowness of his race, [...] "what does <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by soopy?" ...|$|R
