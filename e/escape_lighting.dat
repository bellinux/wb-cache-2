Electronics is helping safety with hazard warning lights, automatically compensated tunnel lighting and measuring equipment to correlate street lighting with road accidents. The use of electronic ignitors to start high intensity discharge lamps assists energy conservation and reduces the material content of the control gear while invertor operated fluorescent tubes for transport lighting has to meet stringent requirements on transients. ...|$|E

The data sample consists of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s) = 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19. 5 fb^- 1. The signature consists of a chargino-neutralino pair decaying to a W boson, a Higgs boson, and missing transverse energy from <b>escaping</b> <b>lightest</b> supersymmetric particles.

40|$|Focal-plane {{arrays of}} quantum-well {{infrared}} photodetectors (QWIPs) equipped with both light-coupling diffraction gratings and metal side reflectors have been proposed, and prototypes {{are expected to}} be fabricated soon. The purpose served by the metal side reflectors is to increase quantum efficiency by helping to trap light in the photosensitive material of each pixel. The reasons for using diffraction gratings were discussed in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: In an array of QWIPs, the quantum-well layers are typically oriented parallel to the focal plane and therefore perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the direction of incidence of infrared light. By virtue of the applicable quantum selection rules, light polarized parallel to the focal plane (as normally incident light is) cannot excite charge carriers and, hence, cannot be detected. Diffraction gratings scatter normally or nearly normally incident light into directions more nearly parallel to the focal plane, so that {{a significant portion of the}} light attains a component of polarization normal to the focal plane and, hence, can excite charge carriers. Unfortunately, light scattered in directions parallel or nearly parallel to the focal plane can escape sideways from the QWIP of a given pixel, as illustrated in Figure 1. The <b>escaped</b> <b>light</b> has made only a single pass through the interior photosensitive volume of the QWIP. The quantum efficiency of the QWIP would be increased by trapping light so that it makes multiple passes through the photosensitive volume. As shown in Figure 2, the sides of the QWIP of each pixel would be coated with gold to reflect <b>escaping</b> <b>light</b> back into the interior...|$|R

This is of great importance for various applications including solar cell, illumination, and many other applications related to light-matter interaction enhancement in devices [22 – 24]. Nevertheless, similar to many novel functionalities obtained in surface-relief structures and nanoparticle-based structures [16 – 24], the existing approaches to obtain diffuse reflector heavily rely on the excitations of the scattering of randomly textured surface [14, 15].

30|$|Several {{beneficial}} {{methods that}} {{can enhance the}} LEE of AlGaInP LEDs have been reported. AlGaInP LEDs with a roughened surface, textured surface, and truncated pyramid geometry were reported to enhance the LEE by increasing the critical angle and the probability of <b>escape</b> of emitted <b>light</b> from an air/semiconductor interface [8 – 10]. Omni-directional reflectors as a p-type electrode and an air-hybrid distributed Bragg reflector structure were also reported to improve the LEE of AlGaInP LEDs significantly [11, 12]. Recently, Wenjing et al. suggested that the fabrication of AlGaInP-based nanorod LEDs using self-assembly metal layer nanomasks can enhance the probability of emitted <b>light</b> <b>escaping</b> from nanorod LEDs [13]. Although the nanorods fabricated using Au metal clusters as nanomasks improved the LEE of AlInGaP LEDs greatly by enhancing the probability of <b>escape</b> of emitted <b>light,</b> this approach cannot be implemented in high-power AlGaInP-based VI-LEDs with wafer-bonded Si conductive substrates, because the formation of Au metal clusters requires high temperature annealing (> 400  °C), which is significantly {{higher than that of}} wafer bonding between the Si conductive wafer and AlGaInP LED wafer.|$|R

40|$|Traditional lidar {{provides}} {{little information}} on dense clouds beyond the range to their base (ceilometry), {{due to their}} extreme opacity. At most optical wavelengths, however, laser photons are not absorbed but merely scattered out of the beam, and thus eventually escape the cloud via multiple scattering, producing distinctive extended space- and time-dependent patterns which are, in essence, the cloud's radiative Green functions. These Green functions, essentially 'movies' of the time evolution of the spatial distribution of <b>escaping</b> <b>light,</b> are the primary data products of {{a new type of}} lidar: Wide Angle Imaging Lidar (WAIL). WAIL data can be used to infer both optical depth and physical thickness of clouds, and hence the cloud liquid water content. The instrumental challenge is to accommodate a radiance field varying over many orders of magnitude and changing over widely varying time-scales. Our implementation uses a high-speed microchannel plate/crossed delay line imaging detector system with a 60 -degree full-angle field of view, and a 532 nm doubled Nd:YAG laser.
