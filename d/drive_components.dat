The Active Driveline system works by disconnecting {{all of the major}} all wheel <b>drive</b> <b>components</b> from the gearbox, rather than at the central coupling. The system also features torque vectoring to direct power to individual wheels. GKN Driveline also supplies the all-wheel drive system for the Standard Driveline thus replacing the Haldex system.|$|E

50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, it can {{be stated}} that as the {{distance}} between the <b>driven</b> <b>component</b> and the measured component increases, the number of antiresonances in the FRF decreases.

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, {{inspection}} {{has declined}} in importance as {{statistical process control}} has assumed a more prominent role in the quality function. However, product quality inspection is still an important task {{in the production of}} hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. In the case study company, which produces hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component,</b> inspection occurs at many points in a process. Inspectors perform 100 % inspection using microscope for many hours without adequate break. After continually monitoring the performance of inspectors, it was found that certain nonconformities were more difficult to find, the number of nonconformities reported was unusual, and inspectors varied in their abilities. Turnover rate of the quality inspection division in this company is high. Therefore, this research aims at determining the impact of working duration and resting time on reducing the mental fatigue in inspection task with microscope in the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. Five types of working duration and resting time were studied and compared using Randomized Complete Block Design of Experiment with two replicates. A variety of data collection tools were used to assist in the data collection. The data collection tools used included bipolar questionnaire, reaction time, and critical flicker frequency (CFF). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. The result showed that, the work-rest period type significantly affects the mental fatigue reduction as measured by questionnaire scores and reaction time. However, the work-rest period type significantly does not affect the mental fatigue reduction as measured by CFF...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new {{framework for the}} dynamic modelling of univariate and multivariate point processes. The so-called latent factor intensity (LFI) model {{is based on the}} assumption that the intensity function consists of univariate or multivariate observation <b>driven</b> dynamic <b>components</b> and a univariate dynamic latent factor. In this sense, the model corresponds to a dynamic extension of a doubly stochastic Poisson process. We illustrate alternative parameterizations of the observation <b>driven</b> <b>component</b> based on autoregressive conditional intensity (ACI) specifications, as well as Hawkes types models. Based on simulation studies, it is shown that the proposed model provides a flexible tool to capture the joint dynamics of multivariate point processes. Since the latent component has to be integrated out, the model is estimated by simulated maximum likelihood based upon efficient importance sampling techniques. Applications of univariate and bivariate LFI models to transaction data extracted from the German XETRA trading system provide evidence for an improvement of the econometric specification when observable as well as unobservable dynamic components are taken into account. multivariate point process, latent factor, transaction durations, efficient importance sampling...|$|R
