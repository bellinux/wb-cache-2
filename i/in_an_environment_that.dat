5|$|Her parents, Franciszek Ksawery Plater and Anna von der Mohl (Anna z Mohlów), {{divorced}} {{when she was}} nine years old, in 1815. She was brought up by distant relatives, Michał Plater-Zyberk and Izabela Helena Syberg zu Wischling, in their family's manor Līksna near Daugavpils (Dźwina), then Inflanty (now Latvia). Well-educated, Plater was brought up to appreciate the efforts of Tadeusz Kościuszko and the Prince Józef Poniatowski. She was fascinated by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, who she could read in the original German language. She was raised <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> valued the history of Poland, and her literary heroes included Princess Wanda and Adam Mickiewicz's Grażyna. She also admired Bouboulina, a woman who {{became one of the}} icons of the Greek uprising against the Ottomans, a Polish fighter Anna Dorota Chrzanowska, as well as Joan of Arc. These pursuits were accompanied by an early interest in equestrianism and marksmanship, quite uncommon for early 19th-century girls from aristocratic families. She was also deeply interested in Ruthenian and Belarusian folk culture. She had contacts and friends in the Filaret Association.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E

An indirect way to destroy them is to place them <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> reactivates them to their vegetative state.

Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E

25|$|The {{aggressive}} spillover hypothesis {{suggests that}} the more aggressive a female is concerning prey, the more likely the female is to cannibalize a potential mate. The decision of a female to cannibalize a male is not defined by the nutritional value or genetic advantage (courtship dances, male aggressiveness, & large body size) of males but instead depends strictly on her aggressive state. Aggression of the female is measured by latency (speed) of attack on prey. The faster the speed of attack and consumption of prey, the higher the aggressiveness level. Females displaying aggressive characteristics tend to grow larger than other females and display continuous cannibalistic behavior. Such behavior may drive away potential mates, reducing chances of mating. Aggressive behavior is less common <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> is female-biased, because there is more competition to mate with a male. In these female dominated environments, such aggressive behavior comes with the risk of scaring away potential mates.|$|E

There {{was a great deal}} of competition during drier times when animals struggled for water in riverbeds that were drying up. The contemporary archosaurs of Coelophysis in Chinle Formation were the crurotarsan Revueltosaurus; the phytosaurs Leptosuchus, Paleorhinus, Machaeroprosopus, Redondasaurus and possibly Rutiodon; several aetosaurs, including Acaenasuchus, Desmatosuchus, Paratypothorax, Stagonolepis, and Typothorax; the crocodilomorphs Hesperosuchus, and Parrishia; the rauisuchians Shuvosaurus, Effigia, Poposaurus, Postosuchus, and possibly Saurosuchus; the dinosauriform Eucoelophysis; and the dinosaurs Chindesaurus, Camposaurus, Daemonosaurus, and Gojirasaurus. Coelophysis also lived alongside the archosauromorphs Crosbysaurus, Tanytrachelos, Tecovasaurus, Trilophosaurus, and Vancleavea; the other amniotes Acallosuchus, Colognathus, Kraterokheirodon, Placerias, and Uatchitodon; the amphibians Apachesaurus, and Koskinonodon; and the fish Acrodus, Lonchidion, Phoebodus, Reticulodus, Xenacanthus, Chinlea, Arganodus, Australosomus, Lasalichthyes, and Turseodus.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> is increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|E
25|$|The Taiwanese {{education}} {{system has been}} praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan's economic development while creating one of the world’s most highly educated workforces. The country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, {{among the highest in}} Asia. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelors degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> is increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations. Taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism {{for not being able to}} fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan’s 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market.
