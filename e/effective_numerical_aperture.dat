40|$|The {{potential}} {{capabilities and}} limitations of single ball lenses for coupling laser diode radiation to single-mode optical fibers have been analyzed; parameters important to optical communications were specifically considered. These parameters included coupling efficiency, <b>effective</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures,</b> lens radius, lens refractive index, wavelength, magnification in imaging the laser diode on the fiber, and defocus to counterbalance spherical aberration of the lens. Limiting <b>numerical</b> <b>apertures</b> in object and image space were determined under the constraint that the lens perform to the Rayleigh criterion of 0. 25 -wavelength (Strehl ratio = 0. 80).

40|$|Optical traps (tweezers) are {{beginning}} {{to be used with}} increasing efficacy in diverse studies in the biological and biomedical sciences. We report here results of a systematic study aimed at enhancing the efficiency with which dielectric (transparent) materials can be optically trapped. Specifically, we investigate how truncation of the incident laser beam affects the strength of an optical trap {{in the presence of a}} circular aperture. Apertures of various sizes have been used by us to alter the beam radius, thereby changing the <b>effective</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture</b> and intensity profile. We observe significant enhancement of the radial and axial trap stiffness when an aperture is used to truncate the beam compared to when no aperture was used, keeping incident laser power constant. Enhancement in trap stiffness persists even when the beam intensity profile is modulated. The possibility of applying truncation to multiple traps is explored; to this end a wire mesh is utilized to produce multiple trapping that also alters the <b>effective</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>aperture.</b> The use of a mesh leads to reduction in trap stiffness compared to the case when no wire mesh is used. Our findings lead to a simple-to-implement and inexpensive method of significantly enhancing optical trapping efficiency under a wide range of circumstances...|$|E
