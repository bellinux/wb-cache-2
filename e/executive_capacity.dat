6000|$|Distributive {{co-operation}} is at {{once the}} simplest and the most [...] successful form, not merely because it requires less for capital [...] than any other for its inception, {{but also because it}} calls for [...] less business and <b>executive</b> <b>capacity.</b> The number of persons [...] capable of managing a small retail store is vastly greater than [...] the class fit to assume control of the very complex duties [...] involved in the care of wholesale houses—or, at all events, of [...] mills and factories. Distributive co-operation has its origin in [...] the fact that the expenses of a middle-man between the producer [...] and consumer may be entirely dispensed with, and in the fact that [...] more capital had collected in the business of distribution than [...] could economically be so employed. Its educating power on the men [...] concerned in teaching them to save, in showing the need of [...] business methods, and in instilling the elements of industrial [...] management, is of no little importance. It is, therefore, the best [...] gateway to any further or more difficult co-operative [...] experiments—such experiments as can be attempted only after the [...] proper capital is saved, and the necessary <b>executive</b> <b>capacity</b> is [...] discovered, or developed by training. In England co-operation [...] began its history in distributive stores, and has finally led to [...] such a stimulus of self-help in the laborer, that now co-operative [...] gymnasiums, libraries, gardens, and other results have proved the [...] wisdom of calling upon the laborers for their own exertions. Under [...] the system which separates employers and the employed, high wages [...] are not found to be the only boon which the receivers could wish; [...] for it is sometimes found that the best-paid workmen are the most [...] unwise and intemperate.(316) For the most ignorant and unskilled [...] of the workmen in the lowest strata the object would seem to be to [...] give not merely more wages, but give more {{in such a way as}} might [...] excite new and better motives, a desire as well as a possibility [...] of improvement. Self-help must be stimulated, not deadened by [...] stifling dependence on a class of superiors, or on the state. The [...] extraordinary growth of co-operation is one of the most cheering [...] signs of modern times. Distributive co-operation originated in [...] Rochdale, in England, about 1844, with a few laborers desirous of [...] saving themselves from the high prices paid for poor provisions. [...] By uniting, they purchased tea by the chest, sugar by the [...] hogshead, which they sold to each member at market prices. They [...] were surprised to find a large profit by the operation, which they [...] divided proportionally to the capital subscribed. Others soon [...] joined them; they took a store-room, and in 1882 there were 10,894 [...] members, with a share capital of $1,576,215, and with realized [...] profits in that year of $162,885. They have erected expensive [...] steam flour-mills, and the society occupies eighteen branch [...] establishments in Rochdale. Libraries containing more than 15,000 [...] volumes, and classes in science, language, and the technical arts, [...] attended by 500 students, have been maintained. The extension of [...] the Rochdale store led to the necessity of a wholesale [...] establishment of their own. It is now a large institution with [...] branches in London and Newcastle. “It owns manufactories in [...] London, Manchester, Newcastle, Leicester, Durham, and Crumpsall; [...] and it has depots in Cork, Limerick, Kilmallock, Waterford, [...] Tipperary, Tralee, and Armagh, for the purchase of butter, [...] potatoes, and eggs. It has buyers in New York and Copenhagen, and [...] it owns two steamships. It has a banking department with a [...] turn-over of more than £12,000,000 annually.”(317) ...|$|E

60|$|Respect for {{the liberty}} of others is not a natural impulse with most men: envy and love of power lead {{ordinary}} human nature to find pleasure in interferences with the lives of others. If all men's actions were wholly unchecked by external authority, we should not obtain {{a world in which}} all men would be free. The strong would oppress the weak, or the majority would oppress the minority, or the lovers of violence would oppress the more peaceable people. I fear it cannot be said that these bad impulses are WHOLLY due to a bad social system, though it must be conceded that the present competitive organization of society does a great deal to foster the worst elements in human nature. The love of power is an impulse which, though innate in very ambitious men, is chiefly promoted as a rule by the actual experience of power. In a world where none could acquire much power, the desire to tyrannize would be much less strong than it is at present. Nevertheless, I cannot {{think that it would be}} wholly absent, and those in whom it would exist would often be men of unusual energy and <b>executive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Such men, if they are not restrained by the organized will of the community, may either succeed in establishing a despotism, or, at any rate, make such a vigorous attempt as can only be defeated through a period of prolonged disturbance. And apart from the love or political power, there is the love of power over individuals. If threats and terrorism were not prevented by law, it can hardly be doubted that cruelty would be rife in the relations of men and women, and of parents and children. It is true that the habits of a community can make such cruelty rare, but these habits, I fear, are only to be produced through the prolonged reign of law. Experience of backwoods communities, mining camps and other such places seems to show that under new conditions men easily revert to a more barbarous attitude and practice. It would seem, therefore, that, while human nature remains as it is, there will be more liberty for all in a community where some acts of tyranny by individuals are forbidden, than in a community where the law leaves each individual free to follow his every impulse. But, although the necessity of some form of government and law must for the present be conceded, it is important to remember that all law and government is in itself in some degree an evil, only justifiable when it prevents other and greater evils. Every use of the power of the State needs, therefore, to be very closely scrutinized, and every possibility of diminishing its power is to be welcomed provided it does not lead to a reign of private tyranny.|$|E
