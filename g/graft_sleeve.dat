40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{development}} of a new open external vascular stent: the lock stent device (LSD). It enables a novel end-to-end sleeve anastomotic technique, named locked anastomosis (LA). The LA technique consists of inserting a <b>graft</b> <b>sleeve</b> within an artery, secured in place by an internal stent and an external LSD. The internal stent, graft, vessel wall, and LSD are fastened together with single sutures. The LSD placement does not require a complete transection of the vessel wall as it can be enlarged and then relaxed to clasp the vessel neck. The tensile strength of the LA technique was accurately measured ex vivo and its stability successfully tested in vivo by acute pressure peak tests and mid-term survival studies. Ex vivo, the ratio between the tensile strength of the LA technique with two, three, and six stitches and that of hand-sewn anastomoses was 0. 41 ± 0. 02, 0. 59 ± 0. 17, and 1. 03 ± 0. 04. In vivo, LA anastomoses tolerated marked increases in blood pressure (peak systolic pressure 195 - 230 mm Hg) for periods of 15 - 25 min without leak- age. Five pigs survived 10 weeks with abdominal aorto-aortic bypass performed according to the LA technique with three stitches. Aortograms showed no narrowing or thromboses, and histological findings confirm uniform flattening of the aortic wall at the anastomosis, with proliferating neointima and uniformly hypotrophic media. Minimal changes were observed in the adventitia...|$|E
5000|$|The Jarvik-7 was a {{mechanical}} device, made of polyurethane and aluminium, {{which was used}} to replace the two ventricles of a human heart.The pumping action came from air, compressed by an electrical unit located outside of the patient's body. The human-made organ had two separate ventricles <b>grafted</b> with Dacron <b>sleeves</b> to the native atria and great vessels. It was powered by a 400-pound (180 kg) air compressor, connected to the heart, through a tube {{coming out of the}} patient body. In order to give the patients the ability to move, it was also invented a portable power console which {{was the size of a}} briefcase. Since 1982, 350 patients have used the Jarvik-7 heart model, and its original design is still used for the modern Jarvik-7, although due to propriety passages the device name is now [...] "SynCardia". On October 2004, the Jarvik-7 model was the first medical device to receive a full-FDA approval.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBone loss (BL) is {{frequent}} during revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA). It is underestimated in X-rays. Most classifications distinguish contained from uncontained BL but {{the most}} frequently used classification is that of Engh, which {{does not take into account}} this element. Reconstruction should result in resistant support for the revision TKA. It helps correct malalignment, restore satisfactory ligament tension and height of the joint line. Several techniques have been suggested: cement, augments, bone <b>grafts,</b> modular metaphyseal <b>sleeves</b> and cones and megaprostheses. Cement is only used with small BL, especially in elderly patients. Augments allow rapid filling of small peripheral BL with good mid-term results but frequent radiolucent lines. Morselized allografts can be incorporated and remodeled. They are a good alternative in young patients. Structural allografts are resistant but there is a risk of fracture and resorption. Modular metaphyseal sleeves and cones incorporate with host bone and are attached to the prosthesis by a mechanical interface or cement. They may also be more durable. Megaprostheses are only indicated in severe BL in elderly subjects. Reconstruction is just one aspect of revision TKA and it should respect the technical requirements of the procedure in particular fixation with a stem, which is important in determining the outcome of reconstruction...|$|R
