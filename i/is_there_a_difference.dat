No shelter, though it hailed. The sheds were for the bricks. Unless, indeed, according to the phrase, each man was a [...] "brick," [...] which, in sober scripture, was the case; brick is no bad name for any son of Adam; Eden was but a brickyard; what is a mortal but a few luckless shovelfuls of clay, moulded in a mould, laid out on a sheet to dry, and ere long quickened into his queer caprices by the sun? Are not men built into communities just like bricks into a wall? Consider {{the great wall of}} China: ponder the great populace of Pekin. As man serves bricks, so God him, building him up by billions into edifices of his purposes. Man attains not to the nobility of a brick, unless taken in the aggregate. Yet <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in brick, whether quick or dead; which, for the last, we now shall see.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. (1.) That scripture {{quoted in}} John 3. [...] "Light is {{come into the}} world," [...] &c., is not meant of that light, or conscience, that every man hath; but the Man Christ Jesus is {{speaking}} there of himself, as God-man, come into the world, born of the Virgin, if thou compare verses 19-21 with 14-18 of the same chapter, it is clear, for they all do speak of the same thing; namely, the Son of Mary. And again, saith he, [...] "I am {{the light of the}} world." [...] Now the man Christ, though he was then in the world, and walked {{up and down in the}} same, yet he was not within any man in the world as man, (though he calls himself the light thereof) though he was in some; I say, in some, as God by his Spirit. Now the light, which was the Man Christ, was the very same, whether loved by some, or hated by others; but if you conclude every man hath Christ, or that light spoken of there (John 3), within him; that I deny, having proved the contrary. But (2.) Whether <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the light? Answ. There are more lights than one, there is a light that may be suspected to be darkness, where he saith, [...] "If the light that is in thee be darkness," [...] &c. Again, there is the light of the law (Prov 6:23). Again, conscience also will convince of sin. Now there is none of these that can save a sinner from the evil of his ways. Take the best of them, which is the righteous law of God, that cannot. For had there been a law given, which might have given life, then verily righteousness had come by the law: But if you conclude that righteousness, or everlasting life cometh by the law, you must conclude this again; that Christ did die in vain (Gal 2:21). So then these things being not able to save the soul, the next thing is, the Son of God, the Son of righteousness arising with healing under his wings; he is also a light, and indeed the saving light, for surpassing all the other mentioned.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to determine if the application of Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) philosophy, principles and tools would result in higher student satisfaction with classroom experiences in a grades 7 - 12 secondary school. An additional purpose was to determine if CQI School Improvement initiatives resulted in positive changes in the elements of school climate, curriculum development, instructional delivery and technology integration that were addressed in the initiatives. ^ Four research questions <b>were</b> considered: (<b>a)</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the overall level of student satisfaction after CQI interventions for school improvement were implemented; (b) <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in school climate after CQI interventions; (c) <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the availability and integration of technology in the classroom; (d) <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in the delivery of instruction under a learning outcomes curriculum?^ A qualitative case study methodology was adopted for the study. A school in rural Nebraska was selected and data were collected from surveys, analysis of school improvement data, and researcher observation. ^ The context of the school improvement process was the application of Total Quality philosophy, principles and tools to address the needs of the school. This systematic process was monitored with a variety of data collection sources. ^ The data included the following results: (1) Student satisfaction with classroom experiences improved slightly. Students felt that teachers were more interested in them as individuals, provided more variety of learning experiences and provided better materials. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> no change in their perceptions of the fairness demonstrated by teachers. (2) School climate was improved as well by the implementation of Behavior management system developed to meet the needs of the at risk student. Also contributing to more positive climate was the successful implementation of a pilot advisor-advisee system in grades 7 - 8. A third climate CQI initiative to improve climate was the successful redesign and implementation of the detention system. (3) A technology plan that had been created via the strategic planning process that preceded the School Improvement Plan was successfully implemented. A local area and wide area network was purchased and installed; a desktop computer was provided for each teacher and additional improvement in technology were made. The survey of student satisfaction results revealed that students recognized the improvement in access and instruction in the use of technology. (4) Finally, a process for developing learning outcomes based on best practice and research and accompanying benchmark assessments was developed for two core subject areas. Benchmark testing and preliminary standardized testing from data collected at selected grade levels revealed high student achievement in those subject areas. ...|$|R

"Facts and Fears: Societal Perception of Risk" [...] - There is {{statistical}} data for many hazards {{that people can}} perceive such as smoking, car wrecks, etc. But without interpretation of the statistics they are just numbers {{and they have to}} be given relevance in their respective context. Slovic looks at the psychology of risk assessment when managing hazards. He says that experts as general publics are needed in the assessment process and “that understanding public perceptions is crucial to effective decision making”. Through his study he looked at how people view as a perceived risk and what determines risk perception. By the end of his research he concluded that “perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable”. Not only <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in perception between experts and public but also the people within the public differ as well. He found that when there is a higher perceived risk it causes higher desired reduction of that risk.|$|E
