The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World is a non-fiction {{compilation}} {{book about}} targeted killing edited by Claire Finkelstein, Jens David Ohlin, and Andrew Altman. It {{was published by}} Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Targeted Killings features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E

25|$|The {{omissions}} {{of individuals}} {{are generally not}} criminalised in English criminal law, subject to situations of special duty, contractual duty, {{and the creation of}} dangerous situations. Whilst other jurisdictions have adopted general statutory duties to rescue, it is not recognised in English law that an individual has any duty to assist strangers <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> peril. Proponents of the current legal position regard it as wrong for the criminal law to punish individuals for committing no physical act, which it is argued would be an infringement on human autonomy. Academics arguing for reform argue that a social responsibility to assist others should exist, particularly where there would be no danger to the rescuer.|$|E
25|$|General {{bystander}} effect {{research was}} mainly {{conducted in the}} context of non-dangerous, non-violent emergencies. A study (2006) tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would get the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies. In situations with low potential danger, significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person. However, in situations with high potential danger, participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim. This suggests that <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> greater seriousness {{it is more likely that}} people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine {{residues}} {{in class}} III β-tubulin are {{actively involved in}} regulating ligand interactions and microtubule formation. Proteomic analysis has revealed that many factors bound to these cysteine residues {{are involved in the}} oxidative stress and glucose deprivation response. This is particularly interesting {{in light of the fact}} that class III β-tubulin first appears in the phylogenetic tree when life emerged from the seas and cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In structural terms, constitutive Class I (TUBB) and Class IVb (TUBB2C) β-tubulins contain a cysteine at position 239, while βIII-tubulin has a cysteine at position 124. Position 239 can be readily oxidized while position 124 is relatively resistant to oxidation. Thus, a relative abundance of βIII-tubulin <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress could provide a protective benefit.|$|E

25|$|In infants, {{behavior}} {{associated with}} attachment {{is primarily a}} process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> perceived distress or alarm, {{for the purpose of}} survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.|$|E
