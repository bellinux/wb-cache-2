5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One {{is that with}} increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b> In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E

5|$|Zombiepowder. began {{serialization}} in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1999, {{and ran a}} brief 27 chapters {{before being}} canceled in 2000. According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo {{was in a state}} of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it, and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombiepowder., and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor's comments rather than trusting <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b> Other than Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. had five credited staff, though their specific roles in its production were never specified.|$|E
5|$|At some time, {{possibly}} in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, {{where his father}} had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil his year's contract at the Domkirche. With few career prospects available in his home city, Handel {{would have liked to}} go to Italy, but this, he realised, was not yet practicable, since he lacked both cash and contacts. Instead in mid-1703 he left Halle for Hamburg, a thriving free city which housed the leading opera house in northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b> By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

25|$|Social {{service was}} an {{essential}} aspect of Vivekananda's ideas, and an innovation which deviated from both Advaita Vedanta and Ramakrishna. He nevertheless attributed these ideas to both, trying to reconcile them with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1996, after {{watching}} the growth and development of programming languages like Java, Perl, and Python, Sassenrath decided to publish <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> within the world of computer languages. The result was REBOL, the relative expression-based object language.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} chapter on family, Engels tries {{to connect the}} transition into these stages with {{a change in the}} way that family is defined and the rules by which it is governed. Much of this is still taken from Morgan, although Engels begins to intersperse <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> on the role of family into the text. Morgan acknowledges four stages in the family.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a change}} in subject matter for Flores' murals {{at the turn of}} the 1970s, {{shifting}} from historical and universal themes to works containing <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> and feelings on social and political events. He painted a series of murals, including Culto al Dinero (Worship of Money) and Estampas de la vida (Prints of Life), which did not garner much praise and were removed from exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|In January 1812 Hazlitt {{embarked}} on a sometime career as a lecturer, in this first instance by delivering a series of talks on the British philosophers at the Russell Institution in London. A central thesis of the talks was that Thomas Hobbes, rather than John Locke, had laid the foundations of modern philosophy. After a shaky beginning, Hazlitt attracted some attention—and some much-needed money—by these lectures, and they provided him {{with an opportunity to}} expound some of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Noyce {{also came}} up with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>idea</b> of an {{integrated}} circuit half a year later than Kilby. His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not.

25|$|At age 19, Buanne {{graduated}} from school in Vienna {{and moved to}} Naples and later Rome. There he attended university to study languages, while looking for opportunities {{in the entertainment industry}} in Italy. He was a guest performer and entertainer on Italian television shows such as Momenti di Gloria, Domenica In and Libero. This success led to a contract with a production company that made shows for RAI and Mediaset. Due to the limited offered international opportunities in Italy, Buanne started to shape <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> and concepts.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question {{that they were}} addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> and words into someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate {{that this was not}} the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.|$|E
25|$|Following its publication, {{there was}} {{increasing}} support for {{ideas of the}} coexistence of God and Nature, with the deity setting Natural Laws rather than continually intervening with miracles. It is perhaps {{for this reason that}} Origin of Species was accepted so readily, upon its eventual publication. On the other hand, the knowledge of the scandal and experience of the reaction of his scientist friends confirmed Darwin's reluctance to publish <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> until he had well researched answers to all possible objections (though, in the end, Darwin had to publish earlier than he had wanted to anyway).|$|E
60|$|The harp {{was removed}} next day. Bob, feeling that his credit for {{originality}} was damaged in her eyes, {{by way of}} recovering it set himself to paint the summer-house which Anne frequented, {{and when he came}} out he assured her that it was quite <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wilson later {{admitted}} {{that it was}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>idea</b> for Geffen {{to take over the}} project, because Wilson wanted to concentrate on his solo career in 2012 and 2013, while Geffen wanted to do another Blackfield album right away in 2012, and Wilson felt guilty about holding him back.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the voyage}} of the Beagle, Darwin had at his {{disposal}} a considerable collection of specimens and, on 29 October 1836, he was introduced by Charles Lyell to Owen, who agreed to work on fossil bones collected in South America. Owen's subsequent revelations, that the extinct giant creatures were rodents and sloths, showed that they were related to current species in the same locality, rather than being relatives of similarly sized creatures in Africa, as Darwin had originally thought. This {{was one of the}} many influences that led Darwin later to formulate <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> on the concept of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|After Tucker and Mendes {{dropped out}} of the lead roles, Diaz signed on to the film with Sony Pictures, and actor Gerard Butler met with {{production}} staff regarding starring opposite Diaz. Butler instead decided to take on the lead role in the film The Bounty Hunter, opposite actress Jennifer Aniston. Tom Cruise considered accepting a role in the film; {{at the time he was}} auditioning for parts in five films including Salt, and The Tourist. Cruise decided he wished to star in Knight and Day, and had a vision for the film which included modifying the male lead character with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas.</b> Other actors cast in the film included Maggie Grace, Peter Sarsgaard, Marc Blucas, Paul Dano, Viola Davis, and Jordi Mollà.|$|E
25|$|Fourier {{used the}} work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat {{equation}} by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Théorie analytique de la chaleur. Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and {{brought them to the}} attention of Cauchy, who combined them with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>ideas</b> and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues. This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices. Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle, and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices. Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.|$|E
5000|$|Gehry {{originally}} {{named the}} house Fred and Ginger (after the famous dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers - the house resembles {{a pair of}} dancers) but this nickname is now rarely used; moreover, Gehry himself was later [...] "afraid to import American Hollywood kitsch to Prague", and thus discarded <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|R
