The regression models for physical properties and texture smoothness of samples were also established. Generally, increasing ratios of basil seed gum in gums mixture increased the apparent viscosity of ice cream mixes and smoothness of texture, but decreased the melting rate.

40|$|The {{influence}} of crystalline microstructure and molecular topology on the strain-induced fibrillar transformation of semi-crystalline polyethylenes having various chemical structures including co-unit content and molecular weight and crystallized under various thermal treatments was studied by in situ SAXS at different draw temperatures. The {{long period of}} the nascent microfibrils, Lpf, proved to be strongly dependent on the <b>draw</b> <b>temperature</b> but non-sensitive to the initial crystallization conditions. Lpf was smaller than the initial long period. Both findings have been ascribed to the straininduced melting-recrystallization process as generally claimed in the literature. The microfibrils diameter, Df, was shown {{to depend on the}} <b>draw</b> <b>temperature</b> and initial microstructure in a different way as Lpf. The evolution of Df was shown to correlate with the interfacial layer thickness that mainly depends on the chemical structure of the chains. It was concluded that, in contrast to Lpf, the microfibril diameter should not be directly sensitive to the strain-induced melting-recrystallization. The proposed scenario is that after the generation of the protofibrils by fragmentation of the crystalline lamellae at yielding, the diameter of the microfibril during the course of their stabilization should be governed by the chain-unfolding and subsequent aggregation of the unfolded chains onto the lateral surface of the microfibrils. The morphogenesis of the microfibrils should therefore essentially depend on the chemical structure of the polymer that governs its crystallization ability, its chain topology and subsequently its fragmentation process at yielding.

Specialty fibres, however, typically have more complex dopant profiles. Designs with high dopant concentrations and multidoping are common, making control of the fabrication process particularly important. In photonic crystal fibres (PCF) the inclusion of air-structures imposes a new challenge for the drawing process. The {{aim of this study}} is to gain profound insight into the behaviour of complex optical fibre structures during the final fabrication step, fibre drawing. Two types of optical fibre, namely conventional silica fibres and PCFs, were studied. Germanium and fluorine diffusion during drawing was studied experimentally and a numerical analysis was performed of the effects of drawing parameters on diffusion. An experimental study of geometry control of PCFs during drawing was conducted with emphasis given to the control of hole size. The effects of the various drawing parameters and their suitability for controlling the air-structure was studied. The effect of air-structures on heat transfer in PCFs was studied using computational fluid dynamics techniques. Both germanium and fluorine were found to diffuse at high temperature and low draw speed. A diffusion coefficent for germanium was determined and simulations showed that most diffusion occurred in the neck-down region. <b>Draw</b> <b>temperature</b> and preform feed rate had a comparable effect on diffusion. The hole size in PCFs was shown to depend on the <b>draw</b> <b>temperature,</b> preform feed rate and the preform internal pressure.

40|$|Changes in {{the amount}} of the rigid, semi-rigid, and soft fractions, chain dynamics, and domain {{thickness}} of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) were investigated as a function of temperature, storage <b>temperature,</b> storage time, <b>draw</b> ratio, <b>drawing</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>drawing</b> rate, ethylene propylene rubber content and addition of nucleating agents. Those changes are studied with high sensitivity using low and high field solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results obtained by NMR are in good agreement with those measured by the above techniques. The small difference between the results can be quantitatively explained by the presence of interface which is not taken into account in DSC, IR, TEM and XRD data analysis. The structural changes due to storage time and temperature are considered to be associated with a molecular rearrangement generally similar to secondary crystallization accompanied by a decrease in segmental chain mobility of the amorphous chains involved in the diffusion process. A decrease in the chain mobility has been observed in all fractions with increasing the drawing rate, draw ratio, and <b>drawing</b> <b>temperature.</b> The increase in the thickness of the lamellae with increasing draw ratio and <b>drawing</b> <b>temperature</b> can be explained by partial melting and recrystallization, as well as immobilization of the amorphous phase.

Experimental studies were carried out by uniaxial drawing tests at temperatures from 90 to 120 °C and at strain rates ranging from 0. 008 /s to 0. 425 /s. Crystallinity and orientation of the drawn samples were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry and birefringence measurements.

During sorbet and ice cream manufacturing, a narrow ice crystal size distribution with a small mean size is desired, {{in order to obtain}} a smooth texture in the final product. This research studied the influence of the mix flow rate, the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant fluid and the dasher speed on the ice crystal size and the <b>draw</b> <b>temperature</b> during sorbet freezing, so as to identify optimal operating conditions. The evolution of the ice crystal size was followed by the focused beam reflectance method (FBRM), which uses an in situ sensor that provides accurate and repeatable information about the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals. Our results showed that the FBRM sensor is a promising tool which makes it possible to monitor online the development of the ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. Decreasing the refrigerant fluid temperature allows us to reduce the ice crystal size and to lower the product's temperature, due to the increase of the supercooling driving force. High dasher speeds slightly decrease the ice crystal chord length, due to the attrition of the bigger ice crystals, which produces new smaller ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. Also, an increase of the dasher speed slightly warms the product, due to the dissipation of frictional energy into the product.

All drawing experiments were performed in the pseudo-affine regime, i. e. no effective relaxation of the molecules occurs during drawing. For such conditions, the Young's modulus is uniquely determined by the applied draw ratio. The general appearance of the stress–strain behavior of drawn HDPE, and in particular its yield strength, however, is strongly influenced by the stretching temperature applied.

The membrane structure parameter (S) and the reverse salt (NaCl) flux selectivity (RSFS) were constant over the temperature range of 20 - 40 1 C, suggesting that within this range, the solution temperature did not significantly influence the membrane polymeric structure. Draw solution properties, including diffusivity, viscosity, and osmotic pressure, {{played an important role}} in water and reverse salt (NaCl) flux behaviour and TrOC rejection. Pure water and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficients of the two forward osmosis membranes increased as both the feed and <b>draw</b> solution <b>temperatures</b> increased from 20 to 40 1 C due to an increase in solute diffusivity and a decrease in water viscosity.

This research studied {{the influence of the}} operating conditions on the ice crystal size and the <b>draw</b> <b>temperature</b> of the sorbet during the freezing process. The evolution of ice crystal size was tracked with the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique, which uses an in situ sensor that makes it possible to monitor online the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. The refrigerant fluid temperature had the most significant influence on the mean ice crystal chord length, followed by the dasher speed, whereas the mix flow rate had no significant influence. A decrease in the refrigerant fluid temperature led to a reduction in ice crystal size, due to the growth of more small ice crystals left behind on the scraped wall from previous scrapings. Increasing the dasher speed slightly reduced the mean ice crystal chord length, due to the production of new small ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. For a given refrigerant fluid temperature and dasher speed, low mix flow rates resulted in lower draw temperatures, {{due to the fact that}} the product remains in contact with the freezer wall longer. High dasher speeds warmed the product slightly, due to the dissipation of frictional energy in the product, the effect of which was in part moderated by the improvement in the heat transfer coefficient between the product and the freezer wall.

Lifting this symmetry to create discrete devices in fibers will increase the utility of fiber devices. Also, the surface of the fiber is rarely studied though complex inner structure have been fabricated for different functionalities. Functionalize the fiber surface would give fiber the ability to better interact with the outer environment. This thesis seeks to address the abovementioned considerations, i. e. to expand materials selection for the fiber co-draw process and to explore variance of the fiber structure including breaking the inner structure translational symmetry and functionalize the outer surface. On the material side, a chemical reaction phenomenon is observed and studied in two different fiber drawing situations. In both cases, new composition is formed during the draw and {{play an important role in}} the formed fiber devices. On the structure side, relying on the principle of Plateau-Rayleigh instability, the fiber inner structure is designed to form a series of discrete semiconductor spheres contacting two metal buses after a thermal selective breakup process. This gives rise to photodecting devices in a silica-cladding fiber which shows a large working bandwidth. The fiber surface is also studied and successfully patterned with micron-scale features during the draw process. The formed patterned fiber surface shows potential in structural coloration and directional wetting. by Chong Hou. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Two {{temperature}} sections {{across the}} track of Typhoon Shirley (September 1965) {{in the vicinity}} of the Kuroshio are shown. The first is based on observations made less than a week before the storm and the second within two days after its passage. The comparison shows: (1) maximum cooling of more than 3 °C directly under the eye of the storm; (2) upwelling of 20 - 25 m on the seaward side of the eye but very little on the inshore side; (3) a slight increase in the depth of the mixed layer; and (4) some evidence that upwelling continued for at least a day after the storm passed. Heat loss to the atmosphere ia estimated at 1000 to 3000 cal/cm 2. From Sept. 2 to Sept. 5, 1965, the R/V Atlan-tis I 1 made an oceanographic section across the Kuroshio south of the Japanese island of Shiko-ku (Fig. 1). A bathythermograph (BT) was taken at each station. On Sept. 9 Typhoon no. 6523, also known as Shirley, became a threat and the ship took refuge in Nomi Wan on the south coast of Shikoku. The typhoon passed across Japan early the next day. A very severe storm, Shirley was in its most intense stage when it crossed the area. It was moving northeast at 25 to 30 knots, with surface winds up to 150 knots and a surface low pressure of 936 millibars. Late on Sept. 10 the ship returned to sea. Hourly BTs were taken during the run south and within the next few days four more oceano-graphic stations were occupied. The BT and station data were used to <b>draw</b> <b>temperature</b> sections to a depth of 200 meters before and after the storm (Figs. 2 and 3). A temperature difference section is shown in Fig. 4. The most striking change was under the eye, where the isotherms were humped up sharply and there was a two-and-a-half degree drop in surface temperature. Unfortunately there was no observation directly under the eye, so the height of the hump is partly guesswork. To the north of the eye the surface tempera-ture dropped about one degree but the deeper isotherms were not markedly disturbed. To the south the storm had greater effect, as shown b...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} blends of {{bacterial}} poly(R-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), with different miscible amorphous components, were prepared. The molecular {{mass of the}} amorphous components was varied from Mn 600 to 200, 000 g/mol. Several factors were found to influence the stress-strain behavior of PHB blends: the glass-transition temperature, the average molecular mass of amorphous phase, the content of PHB in the blend, the crystallinity, and the <b>drawing</b> <b>temperature.</b> It was found that a high extension ratio at rupture R 2 ̆ 6 gt; 3 is obtained only if the PHB content is less than 60...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} of gallium lanthanum sulphide (GLS) based glass over other competing glasses for active and infrared applications are evident through its low-phonon energy, high rare-earth solubility, high transition temperature and non-toxicity. However this glass often devitrifies during fibre drawing {{due to a}} small separation between the crystallisation and fibre <b>drawing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Improving GLS fabrication technology may {{hold the key to}} achieving practical optical waveguide devices. In this paper, we describe the current GLS research status, methods of improving glass purity and our directions toward alternatives to traditional fibre technology, in particular planar channel waveguides and holey or microstructured fibres...|$|R
