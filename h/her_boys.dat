Despite her constant aggressiveness, she is motherly [...] and will defend her family fiercely, especially towards neighbors and others who view them as poor trash; in one episode, she finds that Malcolm and Reese discovered their neighbor {{having an affair with}} her Hispanic gardener while they planned to frame her son for theft, but doesn't punish them for their actions as this counted as revenge against the woman, who hated Lois. Lois is disliked by both Hal's wealthy family and her own parents. She has a younger sister named Susan, who blames Lois for stealing Hal from her. Neighbors despise Lois and <b>her</b> <b>boys</b> and celebrate the weekends when they're gone. In the series finale, she discovered that she and Hal are expecting a 6th child.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{attaining}} adulthood, David King obtained an apprenticeship as a {{store clerk}} in Portsmouth, Ohio, {{where he met}} teenage Almena Caldwell. Her older brother and father fell from a small boat and drowned in the nearby Scioto River. [...] Soon thereafter, Almena's mother died. [...] Her uncle Hannibal Gilman Hamlin (first cousin to Lincoln's first Vice President, Hannibal Hamlin) became the guardian of her and her brother, Hamlin Caldwell, moved them to Cincinnati and saw to their education. David King married her there when she was seventeen. [...] Gotwald wrote a biography of his parents-in-law in which he pointed out sternly that Almena {{was too young to}} marry at seventeen. The Kings moved to Tarlton, Ohio, where they opened a general store. [...] Several of Robert Quigley's (her father's foster father) grandchildren moved to Springfield, Ohio. So, David and Almena King moved there as well in 1840. [...] David proceeded to build a significant portion of early downtown Springfield, which was known for long thereafter as [...] "King's Row". David King died on August 8, 1849 in a cholera epidemic, which he contracted while caring for other victims of the outbreak. According to the Gotwald heresy book, Almena built the Ferncliff Place homestead (which was out in the country when built) to get <b>her</b> <b>boys</b> away from the bars near their home in Springfield proper.|$|E
2500|$|After her husband's death, Almena frugally {{held on to}} {{the family}} wealth. She built a large home at 2 Ferncliff Place in Springfield in about 1852, which was long known as the King Homestead. The Springfield City Directory of that time located it simply as [...] "North of Buck Creek." [...] Buck Creek, which is {{probably}} wide enough to be called a river at that point, has long marked the north boundary of downtown Springfield. There are tall limestone cliffs on both sides of it. Isaac Ward cut building stone from these cliffs, at the location of present-day Cliff Park in Springfield, that later became part of many of the early buildings in Springfield. There was only the Limestone Street footbridge across Buck Creek at the time Almena King built the King Homestead, and that footbridge was more than a block upstream. [...] She bought this land from Robert Quigley's grandson-in-law, Isaac Ward, who lived across the street on present-day Fountain (then Market). The Isaac Ward Mansion still stands today and is still occupied. The Kings and the Quigley descendants remained very close, which is why Ward's father gave him the middle name of [...] "Ward", and Ward went by that middle name all his life. One family account credits Isaac Ward with having been particularly helpful to the King family after the death of David King. Isaac Ward also sold a large tract of his land to Wittenberg College, which now forms the eastern part of its campus and is the reason the main road through present day Wittenberg University is Ward Street. The King Homestead was out in the country when first built, which was to get <b>her</b> <b>boys</b> away from the reported 122 saloons near their home in Springfield proper. All three of her sons attended nearby Wittenberg College.|$|E
