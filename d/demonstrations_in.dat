5|$|In May 2014, as {{multiple}} Chinese activists began {{preparing for}} the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a number of lawyers were arrested for planning or being suspected of planning demonstrations. Among those arrested was Pu Zhiqiang, a lawyer {{who was involved in}} organising the <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> 1989.|$|E
5|$|Another wave {{of demonstrations}} {{occurred}} on August 31, 1982, {{on the first}} anniversary of the Gdańsk Agreement (see August 31, 1982 <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> Poland). Altogether, on that day six demonstrators were killed – three in Lubin, one in Kielce, one in Wrocław and one in Gdańsk. Another person was killed on the next day, during a demonstration in Częstochowa. Further strikes occurred at Gdańsk and Nowa Huta between October 11 and 13. In Nowa Huta, a 20-year-old student Bogdan Wlosik was shot by a secret service officer.|$|E
5|$|As a {{means of}} {{rallying}} supporters to get behind their cause, awareness campaigns against the takeover were launched. Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September.

5|$|Battersea Council {{grew tired}} of the controversy. A new Conservative council was elected in November 1909 amid talk of {{removing}} the statue. There were protests in support of it, and the 500-strong Brown Dog memorial defence committee was established. Twenty thousand people signed a petition, and 1,500 attended a rally in February 1910 addressed by Lind af Hageby, Charlotte Despard and Liberal MP George Greenwood. There were more <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> central London and speeches in Hyde Park, with supporters wearing masks of dogs.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death as proof that Tuđman's government had revived the fascist Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E
5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E

5|$|During the strike, Berkman {{organized}} <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> New York {{in support}} of the miners. In May and June, he and other anarchists led several protests against John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The protests eventually moved from New York City to Rockefeller's home in Tarrytown, New York, and resulted in the beatings, arrests, and imprisonments of a number of anarchists. The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{was first}} {{attracted}} {{to the study of}} electricity when he saw the showman Archibald Spencer do magic <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} the Clay Center Kansas National Guard and in that {{capacity}} was called to assist in crowd safety {{at one of the}} popular flying <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> Topeka in June 1910. Longren's interest in aircraft was ignited after he witnessed the featured airplane spin out shortly after takeoff and crash to the ground. The 28-year-old tinkerer immediately set upon building his own improved version of a flying machine.|$|E

5|$|Later, Darwaza co-founded the {{nationalist}} Istiqlal party in Palestine {{and was a}} principal organizer of anti-British <b>demonstrations.</b> <b>In</b> 1937, he was exiled to Damascus {{as a result of}} his activities and from there he helped support the Arab revolt in the Mandatory Palestine. He was incarcerated in Damascus by French authorities for his involvement in the revolt, and while in prison he began to study the Qur'an and its interpretations. In 1945, after he was released, Darwaza eventually compiled his own interpretation entitled al-Tafsir al-Hadith.|$|E
5|$|Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, {{because of}} videos that {{featured}} <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> {{the city of}} Benghazi by families of detainees {{who were killed in}} Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.|$|E
5|$|The University of Paris, {{founded in}} the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its {{original}} medieval colleges.

Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around {{the city and the}} suburbs.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} of the city are known as Mysoreans in English and Mysoorinavaru in Kannada. The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of Kaveri river water often leads to minor altercations and <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> the city. Growth in the information technology industry in Mysore {{has led to a}} change in the city's demographic profile; likely strains on the infrastructure and haphazard growth of the city resulting from the demographic change have been a cause of concern for some of its citizens.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{power in}} the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, officially the 8th of March Revolution, a power {{struggle}} broke erupted between the Nasserites in the National Council for the Revolutionary Command and the Ba'ath Party. The Nasserites sought to reestablish the United Arab Republic, the former federation encompassing Egypt and Syria from 1958 to 1961, on Gamal Abdel Nasser's terms, the Ba'athists were skeptical of a new union with Nasser, and wanted a loose federation where the Ba'ath Party could rule Syria alone without interference. The Nasserites mobilised large street <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> favour of a union. It took time before the Ba'ath Party knew {{how to respond to}} the issue, since the majority of Syrian Arab Nationalists were not adherents to Ba'athism, but of Nasserism and Nasser in general.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger <b>demonstrations</b> <b>in</b> summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
