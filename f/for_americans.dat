5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; <b>for</b> <b>Americans,</b> most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
