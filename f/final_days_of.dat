She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union in 1941, and returned to Norway in 1942. Ultimately, she was sunk in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945 by American bombers.

Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj.

5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle in the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the fight, to {{the west}} of Sangju, Major John R.

Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. He averaged about 75 stragglers a day, and 150 {{on the last day of}} the battle. A contingent of military police were dispatched specifically to collect men abandoning their positions and to return them to the front.|$|E
5|$|Lollapalooza, {{an annual}} summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event.

Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 in the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Daley administration.

The camp {{was set up by}} the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which shared control of the facility with Croatian Serb rebels. The facility, originally an industrial storage site, was located on the southern outskirts of the city of Vukovar, in close proximity to the JNA barracks. It consisted of eight warehouses surrounded by a wire fence, and was established on 16 November 1991, when the first detainees were brought there.|$|E

Author Veit Scherzer has challenged the validity of 27 of these listings. With the exception of Hermann Fegelein, all of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of the Third Reich during the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> World War II left the nominations unfinished in various stages of the approval process.|$|E
5|$|Arcona {{served in}} all three German navies {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. She served both with the fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a support vessel for the U-boat {{campaign}} in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used for secondary duties. After the German Navy became the Kriegsmarine in 1935, it rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, and broken up for scrap in 19481949.|$|E

5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie in the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow {{after the end of the}} war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} {{decided not}} to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged {{that they were not}} well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Five days later, {{teammate}} {{and close}} friend Vasil Kiryienka rode {{to victory in}} a solo effort, and he too dedicated the stage victory to Tondó, pointing skyward {{as he crossed the}} finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tondó's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while other members of the team grieved with Tondó's family. In the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt earlier on.|$|E

5|$|In April 1945, Robertson {{returned}} to the field, replacing Alan Ramsay as commander of the 5th Division, which was then engaged {{in the final stages}} of the New Britain Campaign. In July, Robertson became commander of the 6th Division, leading it through the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Aitape–Wewak Campaign. On 13 September 1945, Robertson accepted the surrender of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, and his Japanese Eighteenth Army. In December 1945, Robertson took over command of the First Army, becoming one of a select number of Australians to command such a formation, at least on paper, with the rank of lieutenant general. For the final campaigns, Robertson was mentioned in despatches a fourth time.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, amidst {{concerns}} {{of war in}} the Pacific, the unit was deployed north to Darwin in the Northern Territory, where they undertook garrison duties in the weeks following Japan's entry into the war. Following Japanese landings in Malaya, the 2/4th embarked from Darwin and were transferred to Malaya, arriving in Singapore in the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the fighting on the peninsula. In the wake of the withdrawal of British and Commonwealth forces to the island, the battalion was hastily deployed in support of the two Australian brigades—the 22nd and 27th Brigades—in the north-western sector of the island. During the initial Japanese landing, elements of the battalion were heavily engaged around the landing beaches but they were outnumbered and {{over the course of the}} week the defenders were pushed back towards the centre of the island, towards the city of Singapore. They suffered heavy casualties during this time, before subsequently becoming prisoners of war after the fall of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>final</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an {{air campaign}} targeting the VRS. This campaign {{was launched in}} response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E
