5|$|Some {{populations of}} cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} {{between the two}} can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand {{in the winter and}} return in the spring. Migration in western Africa <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|E

25|$|The Antigone Project {2004)' {{was created}} by Miyagawa and Sabrina Peck, and premiered at the Women's Project Theatre. The project is a play in five parts, each part having its own storyline and was written by a {{different}} playwright. The five playwrights who wrote in this play are Miyagawa, Tanya Barfield, Karen Hartman, Lynn Nottage and Caridad Svich. Each story <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to the Patriot Act and incorporates a character named Antigone, inspired by the character written by Sophocles. Red Again is the title of Miyagawa’s piece and {{is set in the}} underworld. The story is the final piece in the play and revolves around characters based on Ismene and Haemon (22). The play received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
25|$|The major {{sticking}} point {{for many in}} the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
25|$|After both Friday {{practice}} sessions, the FIA {{tested for}} the first time a new system called the Virtual Safery Car, which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to minimising the risk of serious accidents and injuries, such as those suffered by Jules Bianchi at the Japanese Grand Prix. Its aim is to force drivers to reduce their speed by about 35% in an accident zone, with the aid of a dashboard display. Drivers have agreed it is a worthwhile system that, however, requires refinement for further testing at subsequent Grands Prix before introduction in 2015. Caterham and Marussia were each granted permission by the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone to miss the Grand Prix after both teams were afflicted with long-term financial problems and placed into administration. This was the smallest field entered into a Formula One motor race since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix. There were two driver changes for the first free practice session. European Formula Three Championship third-place finisher Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne for the second time this season, and Williams reserve driver Felipe Nasr drove Bottas's car.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is often}} seen through two routes of administration, either through consumption or through endogenous ailments such as liver failure. One notable case in which ammonia toxicity is common <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to cirrhosis of the liver which results in hepatic encephalopathy, and can result in cerebral edema (Haussinger 2006). This cerebral edema can {{be the result of}} nervous cell remodeling. As a consequence of increased concentrations, ammonia activity in-vivo has been shown to induce swelling of astrocytes in the brain through increased production of cGMP (Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate) within the cells which leads to Protein Kinase G-mediated(PKG) cytoskeletal modifications. The resultant effect of this toxicity can be reduced brain energy metabolism and function. Importantly, the toxic effects of ammonia on astrocyte remodling can be reduced through administration of L-carnitine. This astrocyte remodeling appears to be mediated through ammonia-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. This mitochondrial transition {{is a direct result of}} glutamine activity a compound which forms from ammonia in-vivo. Administration of antioxidants or glutaminase inhibitor can reduce this mitochondrial transition, and potentially also astrocyte remodeling.|$|E

500|$|While McDonald's {{had been}} trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its {{mainline}} competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of [...] "upscale" [...] sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>response</b> to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.|$|E
