5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It would {{have been one of the}} first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E
5|$|However, as the Earth <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> approached, astronomers {{were unable}} to locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed. Consequently, its orbit could not be {{calculated}} with sufficient precision to permit a flyby.|$|E
5|$|It was {{calculated}} that a flyby mission to Eris could take 24.66 years using a Jupiter <b>gravity</b> <b>assist,</b> based on launch dates of 3 April 2032 or 7 April 2044. Eris would be 92.03 or 90.19 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E

Its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) took its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006.

Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter <b>gravity</b> <b>assist,</b> based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046.

40|$|The future interplanetary {{missions}} {{will probably}} use the conventional chemical rockets {{to leave the}} sphere of influence of the Earth, and solar electric propulsion (SEP) to accomplish the other maneuvers of the mission. In this work the optimization of interplanetary missions using solar electric propulsion and <b>Gravity</b> <b>Assisted</b> Maneuver to reduce {{the costs of the}} mission, is considered. The high specific impulse of electric propulsion makes a <b>Gravity</b> <b>Assisted</b> Maneuver 1 year after departure convenient. Missions for several Near Earth Asteroids will be considered.

5|$|The inner Solar System {{has been}} made the goal of at least four {{unmanned}} programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), {{to take the first}} pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.|$|E
5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without <b>gravity</b> <b>assist.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The solar {{electric}} propulsion {{could be the}} best option for the transports of the future due to its high specific impulse when compared to the chemical propulsion. Electric propellants are being extensively used to assist the propulsion of terrestrial satellites for the maneuvers of orbit correction and as primary propulsion in missions toward other bodies of the solar system. In this work the optimization of interplanetary missions using solar {{electric propulsion}} (SEP) and <b>Gravity</b> <b>Assisted</b> Maneuver to reduce the costs of the mission, is considered. The high specific impulse of electric propulsion makes a <b>Gravity</b> <b>Assisted</b> Maneuver 1 year after departure convenient. Missions for several Near Earth Asteroids will be considered. The analysis suggests criteria for the definition of initial solutions demanded for the process of optimization of trajectories. Trajectories to the asteroid 2002 TC 70 are analyzed. Direct trajectories, trajectories with 1 <b>gravity</b> <b>assisted</b> at the Earth and with 2 <b>gravity</b> <b>assisted</b> with the Earth and either Mars are presented.

25|$|The Oberth {{effect can}} be employed, {{particularly}} during a <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> operation. This effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds, and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body; this can multiply the effective delta-v.|$|E
25|$|A {{gravitational}} slingshot {{can carry}} a space probe onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects, the spacecraft can pick up kinetic energy. However, even more energy {{can be obtained from}} the <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> if rockets are used.|$|E
25|$|Other future mission {{concepts}} include polar probes, Martian {{aircraft and}} a network of small meteorological stations. Longterm areas of study may include Martian lava tubes, resource utilization, and electronic charge carriers in rocks. Micromissions are another possibility, such as piggybacking a small spacecraft on an Ariane 5 rocket and using a lunar <b>gravity</b> <b>assist</b> to get to Mars.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that positive expiratory pressure may assist the clearance of bronchial secretions in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It has been compared with currently used postural drainage techniques. Three treatment regimens were compared in 18 patients with cystic fibrosis. Treatment A consisted of breathing exercises emphasising inspiration, interspersed with the forced expiration technique in <b>gravity</b> <b>assisted</b> positions; treatment B comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure alternating with the forced expiration technique in the same <b>gravity</b> <b>assisted</b> positions; and treatment C comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure and the forced expiration technique in the sitting position. During treatment A a significantly greater quantity of sputum was produced than during treatments B and C (p less than 0. 025 and p less than 0. 001 respectively). Treatment B produced more sputum than treatment C (p less than 0. 005). There {{were no significant differences in}} arterial oxygen saturation, FEV 1 or forced vital capacity. Most adolescent and adult patients are able to carry out their treatment independently using <b>gravity</b> <b>assisted</b> positions, breathing exercises emphasising inspiration, and the forced expiration technique. Sputum clearance was less effective when positive expiratory pressure was included in the treatment regimen...|$|R
