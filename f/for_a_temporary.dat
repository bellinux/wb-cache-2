5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kateb v Godwin, was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza. However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.|$|E

In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish {{the official}} status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> period to allow time for translation).|$|E

5|$|Impossible Princess (retitled Kylie Minogue in Europe <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> period, {{and also}} known as Kylie Minogue 1998) is the sixth studio album by Australian {{recording}} artist Kylie Minogue. It was first released in Japan by BMG on 22 October 1997, and distributed worldwide by Mushroom and Deconstruction months later. The singer asserted partial creative control over the project—who took part as a co-producer and composer to the material—and was assisted by various musicians and producers, namely Brothers in Rhythm, Manic Street Preachers, David Ball and Rob Dougan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E

5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was greeted by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a plan}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Air Ministry, the British {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the Royal Air Force, believed that {{in the event of}} war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered that key government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> emergency government centre. The Office concluded the most suitable site was the basement of the New Public Offices, a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>temporary</b> third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
