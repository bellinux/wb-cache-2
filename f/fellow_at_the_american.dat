2500|$|The CFA {{approved}} {{yet another}} of Fraser and Friedlander's models in December 1930. (These were probably the three-sixteenths size models.) Details about the sculptures now began to emerge. Friedlander's two statuary groups were called Valor and Call to Arms (later retitled Sacrifice). These {{two groups were}} to frame the entrance to Arlington Memorial Bridge. Collectively, they were known as The Arts of War. Both statuary groups were in a style of Art Deco known as [...] "Delayed Deco". Valor {{was based on a}} study Friedlander had completed in 1915-1916 while a <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Academy in Rome, while Sacrifice was created especially for the bridge commission. Sacrifice, modeled in 1929, used the same figures as Valor but added the figure of a child. Because the AMBC specified that the statues were to be in white granite, Friedlander had to change his design for Valor. The sculpture was originally to be executed in bronze. But in order to support the weight of granite, a [...] "web" [...] of supports had to be sculpted beneath the horse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenges}} faced and progress made by Scarnecchia in achieving this objective of promoting rigorous but respectful political debate at the UNM School of Law were highlighted by Christina Hoff Sommers in an October 2006 {{editorial in the}} Albuquerque Journal. Sommers, a <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Enterprise Institute criticized Scarnecchia and the UNM School of Law for “liberal bias” after being invited to speak at UNM and hosted by Scarnecchia. The editorial reported that {{the students at the}} University of New Mexico law school were politically diverse, but cited a previous survey by the UNM College Republicans that alleged that there were no registered Republicans at the time on the law faculty. Furthermore, the editorial alleged, students who did not share the law faculty's political complexion frequently found themselves isolated and marginalized. Sommers cited one example of a student group that explicitly discouraged students from joining the Federalist Society, a prominent national organization that brings conservative and libertarian students, scholars and lawyers together to discuss and debate legal issues. The editorial also criticized a decision to discontinue the “DA Law Clinic”, which allowed students to work with the District Attorney's Office. According to the editorial, “professors were uncomfortable with a program that prosecuted— [...] – rather than defended—accused criminals”. The criticisms and allegations in the Sommers editorial closely resembled previous editorials she authored criticizing other higher educational institutions. Scarnecchia wrote a later editorial responding to Sommers and challenging some of the assertions in Sommers’ letter.|$|E
