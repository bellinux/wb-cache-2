25|$|In 199, Liu Bei {{found an}} {{opportunity}} to leave Xu, under the pretext of leading troops to attack Yuan Shu. He travelled to Xu Province, killed Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao, and seized control of the province. The following year, Cao Cao launched a campaign to take back Xu Province and defeated Liu Bei. Liu Bei fled to northern China, where he took refuge under Cao Cao's rival, Yuan Shao. Liu Bei later left Yuan Shao by pretending to help Yuan recruit the rebels in Runan (汝南; present-day Runan County, Zhumadian, Henan). He eventually found shelter under Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. Liu Biao put him in charge of Xinye County on the northern border of Jing Province.

After Liu Bei had taken over Yi Province, Sun Quan asked him for three commanderies in southern Jing Province but Liu refused. Sun Quan then sent his general Lü Meng to seize the three commanderies by force. In response, Liu Bei ordered Guan Yu to lead troops to stop Lü Meng, but Sun Quan's general Gan Ning deterred Guan from crossing the shallows near Yiyang (益陽) to confront their forces. The shallows were thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨). Lu Su (the commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province) later held talks with Guan Yu to discuss and settle the territorial dispute. Around the same time, Cao Cao had seized control of Hanzhong Commandery and posed a strategic threat to Liu Bei's position in Yi Province. Liu Bei eventually agreed to divide Jing Province between his and Sun Quan's domains along the Xiang River. Both sides then withdrew their forces.|$|E

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed <b>during</b> <b>that</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E
