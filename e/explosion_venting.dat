40|$|International audienceThe most {{commonly}} used method of protection is <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> In its simplest form, a vent is an aperture in the top or side of a vessel to provide a means of pressure relief during an explosion {{in order to achieve}} a reduced explosion pressure Pred. The efficiency of this protection method has been proven by a large number of experiments and documented industrial explosions by which the <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> provided adequate protection. From these experiments several correlations have been established to design venting systems. When compared with realistic, less controlled experiments, it appears that the reduced explosion overpressures may be over predicted but also under predicted. During the last ten years, researchers have devoted significant effort and time to study this problem. The state of the dust cloud at ignition and more specificly the initial turbulence has been identified as being a major contributing factor. This paper aims at presenting a technique to take the turbulence into account when designing an <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> system...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the described research were to examine the underlying physical phenomena occurring during flame/obstacles interactions in various chambers of low L/D ratio {{and to develop a}} new empirical equation for <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> A literature review suggested that the propagating flame/obstacle interactions in enclosures with large L/D ratio (> 2) result in flame acceleration and subsequent pressure build-up during a gas explosion. However, the interactions in practical situations with small L/D < 2 were not extensively studied. In this thesis the first investigation involved the flame interaction with different single and multiple obstacles in a 1 / 20 th model of real enclosure. Results provided the basis for flame propagation, local flame displacement speed probability density functions (pdfs), mean flame velocity and explosion pressure. The second investigation of the study involved the flame interaction with multiple bars within chambers of different L/D ratios. The results provided mean flame velocities on each stage, as a function of nondimensional time, and pressure developments as a function of L/D ratio. The final investigation is associated with gas <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> The predictive ability between existing models on <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> and experimental results obtained in this thesis were undertaken and found to be deficient.

Optimal design of vent systems and credible execution of risk assessments in powder handling plants require practical and reliable ways of predicting the course and consequences of vented dust explosions. The main parameters of interest include flame propagation and pressure build-up inside the vented enclosure, the volume engulfed by the flame, and the magnitude of blast waves outside the enclosure. Extensive experimental work forms the empirical foundation for current standards on vent sizing, such as EN 14491 and NFPA 68, and various types of software for vent area calculations simply apply correlations from these standards.

40|$|It {{is normal}} {{practice}} to use centrally positioned vents or single vents in most experimental {{work and in}} the application of <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> in industry. This work seeks to investigate the influence of non-central and multiple distributed vents on the explosion overpressure. A 10 L cylindrical vessel of 460 mm length and 162 mm diameter (L/D= 2. 8) was used for vented explosion with free venting (without a vent cover). Three different vent coefficient (Kv) were investigated, Kv, 3. 6, 5. 4 and 10. 9 for both non-central and 4 hole vents. 10 % methane-air and 7. 5 % ethylene-air mixtures were investigated to determine the influence of the mixture reactivity. The position of the spark ignition was in the centre of the end flange opposite the vent. It was shown for the non-central vent that the flame speed upstream of the vent was lower than for a central vent and this reduced the mass flow through the vent, which reduced the overpressure and reducing the external explosion due to the lower exit velocity of the unburnt gas and hence lower external turbulence. The external flame jets downstream of the vent was influenced by the increase in characteristic length scale of the vent, which was changed by increasing the number of vents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Bucket {{elevators}} are {{devices for}} the vertical conveying of bulk materials. They {{can be found}} in many plants where silos are used. There are different designs of bucket elevators, whereby for the conveying of combustible bulk materials twin-leg bucket elevators are widely used. The conveyed bulk materials might be quite different, e. g. granulates, grains or pellets, which can contain more or less fine dust. The fine dust will be whirled up and dispersed by the moving buckets. Explosive dust/air mixtures can occur inside the elevator. Bucket elevators are frequently reported as causes of dust explosions [1, 2]. Depending on both the practical operating conditions and the explosion characteristics of the bulk material in many cases explosion protection by prevention of ignition sources are not sufficient to minimize the risk of a dust explosion. Therefore, additional explosion protection by design measures is required in order to limit the dangerous effects of a dust explosion. The technical rules or standards, however, which are available for the layout of explosion protection by design measures, e. g. explosion pressure venting or explosion suppression can not be used due to the specific geometry of bucket elevators. Because there was no sufficient data base to design explosion resistant bucket elevators in combination with <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> or explosion suppression, large scale tests were carried out on the test site of BGN and FS...|$|E

A 0. 2 m 3 cylindrical vessel was used with L/D (length to diameter) of 2, at the limit of applicability of current <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> design guidance. Only end ignition was considered in this study with a vent coefficient, K of 16. 4. Methane/air mixtures over a range of equivalence ratio, Ф (0. 68, 0. 84 and 1. 05) have been used. Results showed that while there is no significant difference in maximum pressure for larger vent duct as compared to a free discharge vent at lean mixtures, however, a significant increase of overpressure ∼ 1. 4 bar was obtained in reactive mixtures i. e.

This was due to the high unburnt gas velocities induced in the vent duct by the most reactive explosion, creating very high turbulence levels at the vent duct inlet which gave rise to very fast flames and very high back pressures. Flame speeds in the vent duct of up to 500 m/s were measured for the most reactive mixture in the larger vent duct.

A case study of dust explosion involving maize starch in closed vessel was used to test and validate the developed conse-quence modelling tool.

Various engineering models (Bauwens et al., 2012, Molkov and Bragin, 2015) and European (EN 14994) and USA standards (NFPA 68) are available to predict such overpressure. In this study, their performance is evaluated using a number of published experiments. Comparison of pressure predictions from various models have also been carried out for the recent experiments conducted by GexCon using a 20 feet ISO container. The results show that the model of Bauwens et al. (2012) predicts well for hydrogen concentration between 16 % and 21 % and in the presence of obstacles. The model of Molkov et al. (2015) is found to work well for hydrogen concentrations between 10 % and 30 % without obstacles. In the presence of obstacles, as no guidelines are given to set the coefficient for obstacles in the model, it was necessary to tune the coefficient to match the experimental data. The predictions of the formulas in NFPA 68 show a large scatter across different tests. The current version of both EN 14994 and NFPA 68 are found to have very limited range of applicability and can hardly be used for vent sizing of hydrogen-air deflagrations.
