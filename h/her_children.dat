I tried to support that she could modify her communication behaviors to <b>her</b> <b>child</b> by herself, and the teaching was conducted using videotape feedback and self-recording procedure. In videotape feedback, the mother was presented with a videotape that recorded the mother playing with <b>her</b> <b>child</b> under a free play situation and in self-recording, the mother was required to record communication behaviors between mother and <b>her</b> <b>child</b> in a daily life situation.
