40|$|In Ria Formosa cockles (Cerastoderma edule) have {{traditionally}} been harvested with a harvesting-knife (HK). However, {{over the last six}} years there has been an increase in the use of a <b>hand-dredge</b> (HD) to exploit cockle beds. A comparative study on the impact of these harvesting methods on the benthic macrofauna was undertaken with the aim of evaluating the possible introduction of the <b>hand-dredge</b> in the fishery. Macrofaunal mortality was very low regardless of the gear. However, the total mortality resulting from using the HK was superior to the one observed for the HD. For the same fishing time the <b>hand-dredge</b> covers an area approximately five times greater that the one covered by the knife, with the former yielding 5 times the catch of the latter. Consequently, the use of hand-dredges increases the fishing effort, which may lead to the overexploitation of the cockle populations. Our results revealed that the immediate effect of both gears on macrobenthic communities was similar and minimal. Therefore, we believe that introducing the <b>hand-dredge</b> in the cockle fishery should only be authorised if other management measures, such as daily quotas, closed areas and limiting the number of fishing licenses, are implemented...|$|E
40|$|The Ashtamudi estuary, {{covering}} {{an area of}} 61. 4 sq km, is tlie {{second largest}} wetland ecosystem in Kerala. Paphia malabarica, the short-necked or yellow-foot clam, is the dominant clam species exploited in the Ashtamudi estuary. It is a benthic filter feeding, bivalve mollusc found in estuarine habitats on {{the east and west}} coasts of India. Up to 1, 000 fishers in the area rely on this clam resource for livelihood. They paddle dug-out canoes from nearby villages to the shellfish beds. Divers dislodge the clams from the seabed with their hands and feet or a team of two or three fishermen use a <b>hand-dredge</b> from the canoe. On a good day a fisherman can gather as much as 200 kg over four-five hours. Another 3, 000 - 4, 000 people are involved in cleaning, processing and trading the clams. The fishery has sustained catches of around 10, 000 tonnes a year for the past decade. The value of the clam fishery in the Ashtamudi estuary is close to US 1 million, with the catch being in good demand in Southeast Asia and Japan...|$|E
