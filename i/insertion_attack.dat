This paper proposes a new fragile watermarking based scheme for image authentication and self-recovery for medical applications. The proposed scheme locates image tampering as well as recovers the original image. A host image is broken into 4 × 4 blocks and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied by inserting the traces of block wise SVD into the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the image pixels {{to figure out the}} transformation in the original image. Two authentication bits namely block authentication and self-recovery bits were used to survive the vector quantization attack. The insertion of self-recovery bits is determined with Arnold transformation, which recovers the original image even after a high tampering rate.

In this paper we present a technique which can eradicate these issues using the SHA 512 signature generation technique in which we embed a watermark in the tuples of the database without changing the original data. That is by adding an extra column of signature bit to the database. This technique is resilient {{to all sorts of}} attacks on the databases which include deletion attack, alteration attack, and <b>insertion</b> <b>attack</b> too. We use a checksum to verify the tampering in the database. This checksum verifies the signature extracted. The database signature is then encrypted with public key using RSA algorithm to obtain security and authorization. This paper shows the implementation of our technique experimentally and also proves it better than the existing systems as we have compared our system with already existing systems which clearly shows the merits of our system. The advantage of our system is that it doesn’t change the original data unlike all other watermarking techniques that modify the bits in the tuples which may alter the usefulness of the data.

However, the security threat to SSIFE-based applica-tions, which will be addressed in this paper, is relatively un-explored. The security threat to SSIFT (called ST-SSIFE), composed of a constrained-optimization keypoint inhibition attack (KIHA) and a keypoint <b>insertion</b> <b>attack</b> (KISA), is specifically designed in this paper for scale-space feature ex-traction methods, such as SIFT and SURF.

In order to leverage among keypoint removal with minimum distortion, suppression of NKG, and complexity, we further present a hybrid scheme of integrating Lagrange multiplier and KKT conditions. On the other hand, KISA is designed via an efficient coarse-to-fine descriptor matching strategy to yield fake feature points so as to create false positives.

40|$|Abstract—Two major {{security}} {{challenges for}} integrated circuits (IC) that involve encryption cores are side-channel based attacks and malicious hardware <b>insertions</b> (trojans). Side-channel <b>attacks</b> predominantly use power supply measurements {{to exploit the}} correlation of power consumption with the underlying logic operations on an IC. Practical attacks have been demonstrated using power supply traces and either plaintext or cipher-text collected during encryption operations. Also several techniques that detect trojans rely on detecting anomalies in the power supply {{in combination with other}} circuit parameters. Counter-measures against these side-channel attacks as well as detection schemes for hardware trojans are required and rely on accurate pre-fabrication power consumption predictions. However, avail-able state-of-the-art techniques would require prohibitive full-chip SPICE simulations. In this work, we present an optimized technique to accurately estimate the power supply signatures that require significantly less computational resources, thus enabling integration of Design-for-Security (DfS) based paradigms.

40|$|A {{histological}} {{study has}} been made of the formation of the cuticle of the third instar of Calliphora. Increase in size of the epidermal cells and nuclei, particularly in the spiny regions, preceded the release of the moulting fluid. The cytoplasm first became vacuolated and this was followed by the appearance of many granules. The basement membrane is constituted in part by stellate tracheoblast cells. The membrane breaks down just before cuticle deposition and reappears after ecdysis. The outer epicuticle is formed from coalesced droplets aligned at the cell surface to form a delicate continuous, folded, acidophil, lipoprotein layer. Further, protein and lipoid (cuticulin) is added beneath this layer from cytoplasmic processes to form the inner epicuticle. These processes later became the pore canals. Endocuticle is secreted as filaments from the epidermal cells between and around the processes. During moulting, phenolic substances and oxidase are transported to the inner epicuticle only in the cuticular spines. Wax and cement layers are not formed and there are no dermal glands. The peak in the secretory cycle of the oenocytes corresponds to the time of deposi-tion of the epicuticle and the secretory material shows similar staining properties to epicuticular material. The oenocyte groups are connected {{with each other and with}} the epidermis by cytoplasmic extensions, through which secretory granules pass.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this thesis is on the {{mechanism}} of olefin metathesis and ring opening metathesis polymerizations. In addition, several reactions of metal alkylidenes and metallacycles which are not traditionally viewed {{as part of the}} olefin metathesis reaction are presented. Olefin metathesis involves the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of metal alkylidenes with olefins and the 2 + 2 cycloreversion of metallacyclobutanes. These reactions are becoming common place in organometallic reaction mechanisms and join the traditional oxidative additions, reductive eliminations, ligand substitutions, intramolecular <b>insertions,</b> nucleophilic <b>attacks</b> on coordinated ligands and ligand fluxtionalities as the commonly sited organometallic reactions. A current goal of organometallic chemistry is to understand the influence of oxidation state, electron count, ligand sterics, ligand electronics and substituent effects upon each of these reactions. The knowledge of mechanisms is essential to be able to understand and rationally manipulate chemical processes. The knowledge also allows for the capability to catagorize mechanistic theories as an organizing device for understanding organometallic chemistry as a whole. Organometallic chemistry, however, is not easily catagorized due to the large complexity of bonding types and structures that inorganic chemistry produces. The work in this thesis has utilized some techniques of physical organic chemistry to study mechanisms and reactive intermediates. These techniques include kinetics, substituent effects, isotope effects, stereochemical studies and theoretical calculations. Organic chemistry has greatly benefited from the advent and subsequent development of the pericyclic theory for the understanding of covalent bonding, frontier orbitals and symmetry. These same notions have met with various levels of success in organometallic chemistry. The success of theoretical studies in organometallic systems very often depends upon the level of electron correlation {{and the extent to which}} the exchange integrals are calculated. The theory presented in this thesis utilizes a fully ab initio method with electron correlation. The structure of organometallic complexes is examined as a function of the nodal planes of the individual metal ligand bonds and their influence on the bonding of other ligands within the same complex. In addition, reactivity of the complexes are probed as a function of the symmetry and energy of the bonding and empty orbitals. In chapter one, data and speculations relating to the mechanism of cleavage of titanocene metallacyclobutanes is presented. The reactive intermediate is postulated to be a titanocene methylidene-olefin adduct. Chapter two further expands upon these mechanistic studies by presenting the kinetics and polydispersities of the ring opening metathesis polymerizations of slightly strained olefins. Chapter three presents work which utilizes ab initio electronic structure theory calculations to determine the energetics of the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of molybdenum alkylidene and imido complexes with olefins. In chapters 4, 5 and 6, reactivity different than the normal cycloadditions of metal alkylidenes and cycloreversions of metallacycles is examined. In chapter 4, an electron transfer mechanism for the reaction of titanocene methylidene with activated halides is presented. Chapter 5 discusses the reactivity of titanocene methylidene with inorganic carbonyls. The titanocene methylidene does not perform methylene transfer as is seen with organic carbonyls, but instead, the resultant oxametallacycle rearranges to yield a titanocene ketene complex. Finally, in chapter six, ab initio electronic structure theory calculations are again presented. They are used to explore the interconversion of a metallacyclobutadiene to a metallatetrahedrane. The two complexes are found to be energetically similar due to a balance between the strength of σ and π bonds and the role of strain and resonance effects. Each chapter was written as an individual study and thus includes an Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion section and a Summary or Conclusion. Thus, this thesis presents work that attempts to add a little more knowledge to the mechanistic and theoretical understanding of organometallic reaction mechanisms. ...|$|R
