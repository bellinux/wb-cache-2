The main aim of the thesis is to map attitudes of specialists and students to education and the educational reform. In the thesis I applied my mind to the rate of awareness of fees at universities in the Ceske Budejovice region. The bachelor thesis is divided in two parts. The one is theoretical and the second is practical. The basic terms which are connected with education are defined in the theoretical part. The thesis concerns with the development of education from the first compulsory education, which was implemented by a Habsburk monarch Marie Terezie in 1774, up to a current educational system in the Czech republic. The information about an educational system in the field of preschool education, elementary education, secondary education, higher technical education and tertiary education are described here. The current reform of tertiary education where the Project of tertiary education reform is involved is also the part. The main target of the project is to propose an ideal system of the tertiary education management and financing. The legislative confirmation of a right to education is the essential part of the thesis. In the end of the work I focus on {{the current state of the}} reform and it's continuous changes. The last updated information concerned with the problem are from the month of April, this year. The practical part of the work describes the specification of a target, hypothesis, a personal research and a data evaluation.

40|$|This paper compares four short- and {{medium-term}} strategies {{available to}} public {{higher education to}} balance budgets {{in the face of}} major cutbacks in public funding. These strategies include: capping enrolments, changing the enrolment mix, raising prices and increasing enrolments without raising prices. The paper assesses the likely effects of these four strategies on the performance dimensions of participation, equity, productivity and quality. Some of the key political and economic considerations that do and should inform the decisions of institutional leaders are then considered. We conclude that there are fundamental inadequacies in our understanding of the possible impacts of changing enrolments on marginal costs. This means that higher education system and institutional leaders may not be fully and rationally exploring the range of options available to balance their budgets in the face of recession-driven cutbacks; in particular, they may not adequately consider the possibility of increasing <b>enrolments</b> without increasing <b>fees.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Overview For {{more than}} a year Australia has debated deregulating {{university}} fees for domestic undergraduates. The issue is controversial, but for many years fees have been deregulated for international students and domestic postgraduate coursework students. This report looks at how much these students pay for their courses, and analyses differences between these fees. Australian universities responded enthusiastically to the deregulation of the international and domestic postgraduate coursework markets. Although the fees charged are often high, strong enrolment growth shows students are willing to pay them. Last year, for example, 312, 500 international students were enrolled in Australian universities, nearly twice as many as in 2001. They comprise nearly a quarter of all <b>enrolments.</b> Student <b>fees</b> from deregulated places are important to university finances. They provided a fifth of public university funding, or nearly $ 6 billion, in 2013. Public universities earned at least $ 4. 3 billion from international students in 2013, while most of the remaining amount came from fee-paying domestic postgraduates. For both international and domestic students, fees vary by discipline and especially by university. International students usually pay significantly more, and never less, than domestic students in the same course. Their fees are set in a global, commercially-oriented market in which prestigious universities charge international students a substantial fee premium over less well known universities. In some disciplines, students at the most expensive university pay {{more than twice as much}} than students at the cheapest university. Despite the cost, many international students prefer expensive universities. In most disciplines high-fee universities enrol more international students than low-fee universities. Australian students are less willing than international students to pay a large prestige premium. They and their prospective employers understand the strengths of local universities. They know that research-driven international university rankings are an imperfect guide to the quality of graduates. Many Australian postgraduate students already have a foothold in the labour market. They have less need to impress employers with university prestige. Even so, in several disciplines domestic students, like international students, prefer the more expensive universities. In some postgraduate courses, the market is affected by price-controlled government-supported places. This is especially true of education and nursing degrees. These places help keep fees down for domestic students without a government-supported place. Many universities offer full-fee places at less than what they receive for a government-supported student. A future Grattan report will explore what profits universities make on fee-paying students and the policy implications of what happens to the money...|$|R
40|$|Although the European Court of Justice has {{sometimes}} even {{been called the}} "motor of integration" and {{the driving force of}} integration that influences the level of integration through its case law, this notion has not been commonly adopted and accepted by all theoretical approaches dealing with European integration. Debates on the ways how the role and influence of the Court of Justice on the EU integration process should be interpreted are still topical. The choice of subject for this Bachelor's thesis is {{based on the fact that}} the free movement of students in the EU and studies in other Member States have become such a common part of everyday life that the author of the thesis became interested in finding out whether and which changes have taken place in connection with the rights of students. The subject of the thesis is topical as the number of students who use the opportunity to move freely in the EU area without internal borders and to study in another Member State has statistically been growing yearly. The aim of the Bachelor's thesis was to analyse the influence of the Court of Justice on the integration level of the European Union and to find an answer to the question whether and in which cases the decisions of the Court of Justice can influence this integration level. The thesis concentrated on the analysis of the rights of students and the European Communities’ competence for education and the role of the Court of Justice in this process. The thesis posed the following hypothesis: the European Court of Justice has a dominant effect on the integration level of the European Union, but this is true only if the Member States lack a common position on the issue brought before the Court of Justice. The empirical data comprised five of the most important rulings of the Court of Justice on students' rights, which were also referred to most frequently in specialised literature. The aim of the methodological framework created for analysing the empirical data and of the analysis was to determine which of the integration theories dealt with in the thesis, i. e. neofunctionalism or liberal intergovernmentalism, better explains European integration. The empirical analysis was carried out separately for each case, but the analysed data were compared to test the hypothesis, and general conclusions were drawn on this basis. The results of the analysis did not confirm the hypothesis of the thesis and the influence of the Court of Justice on the integration level had to be affirmed even in situations where the Member States had a common position which was almost without exception contrary to the opinion of the Court of Justice on the specific issue. The ruling of the Gravier case showed that the Court of Justice does not allow Member States to dictate the way how to interpret Community law or how to define a specific term (in this case the term "vocational training") in Community law. Basically the court stated in the Gravier ruling that the possibilities for obtaining education and internships and participation in studies are regulated by Community law, which is why it is forbidden to discriminate against students from other Member States on the basis of citizenship, which also applies to prescribing an <b>enrolment</b> <b>fee</b> as a precondition to being admitted to a vocational training course. The court ruling in the Blaizot case where the Court found that the term "vocational training" does not exclude university education and extended this term on certain conditions also to university studies was one step forward in increasing integration in the field of the Community's competence for education. The change in the integration level could not be considered defined in the ruling made in the Brown case where the Court stated clearly that the development level of Community law regarding competence for education during the preliminary ruling does not allow for subsistence and education allowances given to university students of other Member States to be considered to belong within the scope of the Treaties. While in the Gravier and Blaizot case, the Member States submitting their comments lacked the necessary number of votes to have a blocking minority in the Council of the European Union during the preliminary ruling procedure, which would have allowed them to block unfavourable decisions taken via qualified majority voting in the Council of the European Union, the blocking minority was reached in the Brown case. In the Grzelczyk case the Court of Justice dealt with rights stemming from European Union citizenship and solved issues related to the conditions of receiving social benefits. The Court of Justice stated in its ruling that developments have taken place in the EU’s competence for education, making it necessary to change previous case law, i. e. the statements of the Brown case, and to take the position that the EU law recognises certain financial solidarity between Member States and hence also the right of students from other Member States to receive social benefits if certain conditions are met. Despite the existence of a common position of the Member States contradicting the Court of Justice in the Grzelczyk case, the Court made a ruling that could be considered as reinforcing the level of integration. The Member States laid a significantly strong emphasis on the preliminary ruling procedure in the Bidar case, which dealt with issues on receiving study loans, and they took the common position that subsistence allowances do not fall within the scope of the Treaties. Despite the strong opposition by the Member States and the European Commission, the Court found that education allowances in the form of study loans and stipends belong within the scope of the Treaties, and hence extended the rights of students. As the Court of Justice made decisions that clearly increased the rights of students and the Community's competence for education and did this despite the common opposition by the Member States, it can be said that the neofunctionalist integration approach proved to be more accurate. However, the court rulings analysed in this thesis alone are not a sufficient basis to state unambiguously that the Court made rulings reinforcing the integration level regarding the competence for education with the clear aim of increasing its own influence and role, which is why the accuracy of the neofunctionalist integration theory cannot be definitively affirmed. The thesis concludes that the European Union integration process is essentially such a multifaceted and complex process that neither approach alone, i. e. either neofunctionalism or liberal intergovernmentalism, can fully explain the European integration process and the role of intergovernmental institutions in it, which is why further research in this field will be necessary...|$|E

How {{economic}} agents can make sense from imperfect information {{is a central}} challenge in economic theory. In this thesis, I first explore how voters try to infer {{the quality of their}} government based not only on the information they personally receive but also on observations of their home and foreign governments' policies. Can voters learn from such information and thus any improved accountability reduce "political pandering"? Secondly, I study two models of education where the incentives of both students and firms are profoundly affected by the imperfect informativeness of education certificates and study how increases in <b>enrolment</b> and tuition <b>fees</b> affect educational and job market outcomes. The first chapter, Pandering Across Borders, studies when voters can use information from foreign countries to reduce domestic political pandering, and when pandering is contagious between countries. The voters condition their electoral decisions not only on policies chosen in their home countries, but also on those implemented abroad. Since the policy decisions are driven by re-election concerns, both sources of information may be biased. As a result, informational linkages between the countries give rise to pandering externalities which lead to ambiguous welfare effects of access to international news. The model also shows that institutional harmonisation via internal synchronisation of election dates increases the parameter range in which pandering may occur. Beliefs, Access Constraints and Voluntary Education Decisions, the second chapter of this thesis, contributes to the debate on the negative consequences of high growth rates in university enrollment with a focus on CEE countries. I propose a theory how low education supply elasticities in the short run can lead to self-fulfilling equilibria in a setting in which signalling is reduced to an effortless binary certification technology. When the agents believe that the certification precision is low they enrol at a higher rate and, due to those inelasticities, their beliefs fulfil. The opposite holds when the agents have high beliefs on the quality. The selection among these equilibria depends on students' initial beliefs {{about the quality of the}} certification technology. The final chapter, Tuition Fees in a Signalling Model of Education, analyses the trade-off between tuition fees and educational effort. Education serves purely as a signaling device and implies a non-pecuniary cost inversely proportional to students' ability, while tuition fees are independent of ability. In this framework, higher tuition fees can be beneficial for high ability students since they reduce the enrolment rates of the less able agents reducing the effort level necessary to separate. The overall effect of tuition fees is complex and is associated with non-monotonicities in actions of the players in the model...|$|R
