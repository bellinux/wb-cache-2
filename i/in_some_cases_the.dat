5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E

Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and round up slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre.
