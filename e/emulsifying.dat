5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as <b>emulsifying</b> of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E

30|$|Matrix-acidizing {{operations}} have been accounted {{to be the}} most hazardous and environmentally harmful among all the well-stimulation techniques. For instance, diesel oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acids have been prohibited from usage due to their high level of toxicity. There is, therefore, a dire need for <b>emulsified</b> acids that are environmentally viable and technically competent to replace the diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acids. In this study, a novel oil-based environmental friendly <b>emulsified</b> acid has been synthesized from Jatropha curcas oil and, then, compared against diesel and palm oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acids. The technical evaluation of the three acids has been done based on experimental results obtained from thermal stability, droplet size analysis, rheological study, acid solubility, and toxicity screening. In addition, core flooding experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the three <b>emulsified</b> acids as well stimulants. The results revealed that Jatropha oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid has the potential to replace diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acid. Jatropha oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid was found to perform better than the diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acid as indicated by having greater thermal stability and more popular rheological properties at varying temperatures of ambient, 50 and 70  °C. Furthermore, it possessed a lower toxicity load and a higher retardation effect on acid solubility than that of the diesel oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid. The core flooding results have also indicated better well-stimulation performance of Jatropha-based <b>emulsified</b> acid as compared with diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acids.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emulsified</b> acids {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} oil industry since 1933. Most of the available research and publications discussed mainly the application of <b>emulsified</b> acid in the field. A fair number of the published work also discussed in depth some of the <b>emulsified</b> acid properties such viscosity, stability and reactivity. However, all of the available research discussed the <b>emulsified</b> acid without sufficient details of its preparation. Beside their chemical composition, the ways <b>emulsified</b> acids are prepared cause significant differences in their physical properties. The characterization of <b>emulsified</b> acid by its droplet size and size distribution complements its chemical composition and gives the <b>emulsified</b> acid a unique description and thus reproducible properties. No previous study considered the impact of the droplet size on the characteristics and properties of <b>emulsified</b> acid. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to study the effects of the droplet size on various properties of <b>emulsified</b> acid such as viscosity, stability and reactivity. Results showed that the droplet size and size distribution have a strong effect on the stability, viscosity and diffusion rate of the <b>emulsified</b> acid. The results of this work are important because knowledge of the effect of the droplet size on major design parameters will guide the way <b>emulsified</b> acid is prepared and applied in the field...|$|R

25|$|<b>Emulsifying</b> agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the interfacial tension γ between oil and water. When <b>emulsifying</b> agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E

30|$|<b>Emulsified</b> acid has {{attracted}} considerable {{attention of the}} oil and gas industry due to its delayed nature that allows deeper penetration of acid into the formation which essentially facilitate further enhancing the well productivity, and at the same time minimizes the corrosion issues. However, <b>emulsified</b> acid has only been extensively studied and applied on carbonate formations. Considering more than half of the reservoirs worldwide are sandstone reservoirs, studying the effects of <b>emulsified</b> acid on sandstone under high-temperature conditions would unlock the potential of <b>emulsified</b> acid and help generate more value for {{the oil and gas}} industry by improving the well productivity from sandstone reservoirs. To ensure the applicability of the <b>emulsified</b> acid on the real sandstone reservoir, which usually has a temperature higher than ambient conditions, the stability of <b>emulsified</b> acids is investigated under 300  °F. Then, the stable <b>emulsified</b> acid samples are developed and their impact on the properties of Berea sandstone core samples, including porosity, pore-size distribution, permeability and wettability, are investigated. The core samples have undergone pre-flush (10 % HCl: 5 % CH 3 COOH) before the main flush (<b>emulsified</b> acid). The <b>emulsified</b> acids are prepared using hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, cationic surfactant and chelating agent. Fourteen core samples are saturated with different <b>emulsified</b> acids under vacuum conditions for 3  days to ensure maximum saturation. The porosity, permeability and wettability of each core sample are measured before and after the reaction with acid. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis has been applied to evaluate the change in pore size distribution. This study has demonstrated that the <b>emulsified</b> acids are capable of improving the porosity and permeability of Berea sandstone core sample. The pore size distribution has also been affected by the application of <b>emulsified</b> acid, where more large pores have been evolved to the core samples due to the reaction of acids with the sandstone which ultimately helps in improving the productivity of hydrocarbons. This indicates less precipitation of the secondary reaction products resulting better enhancement in sandstone flow properties. These results demonstrate the potential of <b>emulsified</b> acid during sandstone acidizing as <b>emulsified</b> acid significantly improved the sandstone properties which can essentially enhance the well productivity.|$|R

25|$|However, {{hydraulic}} oils {{and the majority}} of oils that have degraded to any extent will also have a soluble or emulsified component that will require further treatment to eliminate.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{research}} and indoor experiments, this paper investigates the mixing and curing techniques, pavement performance, and influencing factors of <b>emulsified</b> asphalt cement concrete.

Adding cement to mixture can improve the pavement performance of mixture greatly. However, increasing the content of <b>emulsified</b> asphalt has opposite effect. Proper content of <b>emulsified</b> asphalt will ensure the bonding strength and waterproof property of the mixture.

25|$|Two {{unprotected}} oil droplets {{with small}} radii in water are favored thermodynamically to coalesce into one bigger droplet because the process yields a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio. The energetic {{contribution of the}} interfacial layer over that same volume of oil is minimized when the two droplets fuse together. Thus, the coalescence process puts the system in a lower energy state and the process would occur spontaneously. However, when the oil droplets are coated with <b>emulsifying</b> agent, electrostatic repulsive force is introduced among the oil droplets which keeps the droplets from coming together.|$|E
30|$|According to Ehrenberg and Nadeau (2005), a {{significant}} portion (approximately 50 %) of the hydrocarbon discovered worldwide is trapped in sandstone reservoir. Therefore, the successful application of <b>emulsified</b> acid on carbonate has raised the interest of performing matrix acidizing using <b>emulsified</b> acid in a sandstone reservoir. However, matrix acidizing using <b>emulsified</b> acid is more developed for carbonate and is very rarely studied and applied on sandstone (Navarrete et al. 1998).

25|$|Silica {{is rather}} inert chemically. It is not {{attacked}} by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine {{at room temperature}} to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000°C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and metalloid oxides to form {{a wide variety of}} compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, sodium silicate is often used in detergents due to its buffering, saponifying, and <b>emulsifying</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), they can act as emulsifiers that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve. This occurs because the insoluble species {{can be incorporated into}} the micelle core, which is itself solubilized in the bulk solvent by virtue of the head groups' favorable interactions with solvent species. The most common example of this phenomenon is detergents, which clean poorly soluble lipophilic material (such as oils and waxes) that cannot be removed by water alone. Detergents clean also by lowering the surface tension of water, making it easier to remove material from a surface. The <b>emulsifying</b> property of surfactants is also the basis for emulsion polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Some {{birds have}} {{a supply of}} powder down {{feathers}} which grow continuously, with small particles regularly breaking off from {{the ends of the}} barbules. These particles produce a powder that sifts through the feathers on the bird's body and acts as a waterproofing agent and a feather conditioner. Powder down has evolved independently in several taxa and can be found in down as well as in pennaceous feathers. They may be scattered in plumage as in the pigeons and parrots or in localized patches on the breast, belly, or flanks, as in herons and frogmouths. Herons use their bill to break the powder down feathers and to spread them, while cockatoos may use their head as a powder puff to apply the powder. Waterproofing can be lost by exposure to <b>emulsifying</b> agents due to human pollution. Feathers can then become waterlogged, causing the bird to sink. It is also very difficult to clean and rescue birds whose feathers have been fouled by oil spills. The feathers of cormorants soak up water and help to reduce buoyancy, thereby allowing the birds to swim submerged.|$|E

25|$|Nixtamalized maize {{has several}} {{benefits}} over unprocessed grain: {{it is more}} easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the corn oil is broken down into <b>emulsifying</b> agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, {{in the production of}} tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items.|$|E
