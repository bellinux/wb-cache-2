5000|$|The {{story behind}} [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] is quite involved. The melody and {{structure}} of the song was inspired by a poem by Rudyard Kipling called [...] "The Ladies". Jimmie Grimes (bassist with Alex's Soulband in the 1950s and 60s) adapted the poem, composed music for it and retitled it [...] "I Learned About Women" [...] (credited to Kipling/Grimes), which Alex recorded on his 1964 solo LP The Blues (Polydor HI FI 46 441 mono & SLPHM 237 641 stereo). In 1977 Alex took the music from this song and wrote the lyrics of [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] over it. In November 1977 Mountain Records was planning to release the song as a single [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] b/w [...] "Anthem" [...] (1977 Mountain - Cat No: TOP 34). Alan Freeman played an acetate of the single on his Saturday Show and announced that it would be SAHB's [...] "new single." [...] However, Alex was afraid of upsetting his parents, Leslie and Margaret with the lyrics [...] "My brother was killed on the stage" [...] and phoned up Jimmie Grimes telling him NOT to sign the publishing rights clearance form. Jimmie was offered money by Mountain Records, but he stuck to his guns and refused to sign. The single had to be pulled. Unfortunately, copies of the Rock <b>Drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> had been printed on Mountain listing [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] on Side Two. The album, due for release in November 1977 in the UK was held up and had to be re-pressed with a replacement track [...] "Mrs. Blackhouse" [...] on it. Rock Drill was finally released in the UK in March 1978 (Mountain - Cat No: TOPS 114). Some early UK white label test pressings of Rock Drill contain [...] "No Complaints Department", but an actual finished British copy of the album on the Mountain label has never been seen containing the track to this day (although the sleeve has an amendment sticker over the Side Two listing stating [...] "Mrs. Blackhouse"). In late 1977 Rock Drill was released on Vertigo in Germany and Norway containing [...] "No Complaints Department", but the album was quickly withdrawn and replaced by copies with [...] "Mrs. Blackhouse" [...] on them. The acetate of the single played by Alan Freeman is the original mix of the song. The David Batchelor-remixed version of [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] appears on the UK edition of Portrait (LP/CD/cassette), the UK white label test pressing of Rock Drill and the German and Norwegian pressings of the album. [...] "No Complaints Department" [...] never reached the pressing stage as an actual single.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccurate {{positioning}} of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> into the locking compression plate (LCP). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking screw holes and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> into the plate. Variables relating to LCP <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> insertion time were analyzed. ResultsIt took an average 6. 6 seconds to insert the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the tilt of the screw hole but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8. 8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5. 6 seconds). DiscussionTilted screw holes and combination-type holes affect the insertion of the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> into 3. 5 mm LCPs. Level of evidenceLevel IV, experimental study...|$|E
30|$|The {{instruments}} {{used in this}} maneuver {{are shown}} in Fig.  2 c. A stab incision is given on the lateral aspect of distal fragment about 5 -cm distal to the fracture site. A 5 -mm <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> (preferably with serrated end) is inserted up to the bone. A 3.2 -mm drill bit is used to drill the near cortex of the bone in the distal fragment. A 4.5 -mm Schanz screw is inserted through the <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve</b> into the near cortex of distal fragment (Fig.  2 d). Now, the surgeon controls the distal fragment with the Schanz screw and the proximal fragment {{with the help of}} cannulated reamer to achieve fracture reduction, and the assistant inserts the guide wire through the cannulated reamer into the canal of distal fragment. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs must be taken at this stage to confirm guide wire positioning in the distal fragment using portable X-ray machine. The reaming of the canal is performed up to the desired level. The reaming should be gentle and excessive force should never be used. Over reaming of 1.5  mm is necessary to prevent nail deformation while insertion. An interlocking nail of appropriate size is inserted. Intra-operative radiographs may be taken to assess fracture reduction, nail length, and alignment prior to locking.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, guided implant surgery {{has been}} {{introduced}} and several studies verified its accuracy. While those studies reported on {{the accuracy of the}} entire procedure, this experiment wanted to evaluate the degree of deviation that can occur during the drilling procedure alone, due to the tolerance of the <b>drill</b> in the <b>sleeve</b> insert. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Drilling was executed in a plexi-glass box with a maximal inclination of the <b>drills</b> within the <b>sleeve</b> insert. Different sleeve inserts, sleeve positions, sleeve heights, sleeve insert heights and diameters were evaluated. RESULTS: The two tested sleeve inserts gave a maximum deviation in angulation of 5. 2 ° and a maximum horizontal deviation of 1. 3  mm at the implant shoulder and 2. 4  mm at the apex for a 13  mm implant. These deviations decreased if the distance of the sleeve above the plexi-glass box became smaller and hand hold sleeve inserts gave less deviation than <b>drill</b> hold <b>sleeve</b> inserts. The deviation increased by longer implant length, larger drill key diameter, shorter <b>sleeves</b> and/or <b>drill</b> key heights. CONCLUSIONS: For a minimal deviation during the surgery with a stereolithographic guide, {{it is very important to}} use the drill in a centric position, parallel to the cylinder. The use of longer <b>drill</b> keys and <b>sleeves</b> are critical for optimal accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{abrasion}} of the sleeve, {{which is}} usually made of aluminium, caused during the drilling process, {{needs to be taken}} into account, especially for longer implants, where the <b>drill</b> engages the <b>sleeve</b> for a longer time. Horwitz et al. [24] found in their in vitro study that multiple uses of the <b>drill</b> and <b>sleeve</b> reduced the accuracy of the system. Cassetta et al. [12] using a modification on the External Hex Safe® (Materialise Dental, Leuven, Belgium) system (Group A) in order to minimise tolerance and reduce friction and damaging of the <b>sleeve</b> by the <b>drill</b> motion showed statistically improved accuracy in a retrospective clinical study. This could be interpreted as the best practice being the use of sleeves for a single time and the drills for the times recommended by the manufacturer. The abrasion of the components due to usage is not incorporated in our study.|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{technique}} is quoted anecdotally {{as a means}} of lowering the incidence of pin infection. The goal is to prevent injury to the bone and soft tissues and subsequent bacterial colonization of necrotic tissue. Intra-operative precautions such as protecting soft tissues with <b>drill</b> <b>sleeves,</b> using sharp <b>drill</b> bits, avoiding thermal necrosis when using power drills, and preventing ischaemic necrosis of skin by implanting wires or pins without excessive skin tension are all measures thought to reduce pin site infections [16, 37, 42]. Although these techniques have not been studied formally, they represent good practice. Taking measures to reduce thermal and mechanical damage of bone during pin insertion are important as these factors have been linked to fibrous tissue formation, pin loosening, and infection [33, 57]. Unicortical placement of pins and wires can generate excessive heat and burn the bone and should be avoided. Tourniquet use during pre-drilling and wire insertion will decrease blood flow to the bone and tissues preventing blood from naturally “cooling” the bone; this may, in turn, result in thermal necrosis of bone. In addition to thermal damage, haematoma formation is associated with greater rates of pin site infection [12].|$|R
40|$|In {{orthopedic}} {{and trauma}} surgery, metallic plates {{are used for}} reduction and fixation of bone fractures. In clinical practice, the intra-operative planning for screw fixation is usually based on fluoroscopic images. Screw fixation is then performed on a free-hand basis. As such, multiple attempts may be {{required in order to}} achieve an optimal positioning of the fixing screws. To help the physician insert the screws in accordance to the planned position, we propose a method for screw insertion guidance. Our approach uses a small video camera, rigidly placed on the drill, and a set of small markers that are rigidly fixed on a variable angle <b>drill</b> <b>sleeve.</b> In order to investigate the achievable accuracy of our setup, we simulate the estimation of the drill bit position under two different marker arrangements, planar and 3 D, and different noise levels. Furthermore, we motivate our choices for marker design and position given the limited space available for marker positioning, the requirement for accurate position estimation of the drill bit and the illumination changes that could affect the surgical site. We also describe our proposed marker detection and tracking pipeline. Our simulation results let us conclude that we can achieve an accuracy of 1 ◦ and 1 mm in the estimation of angular orientation and tip position of the drill bit respectively, provided that we have accurate marker detection...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of a novel radiation-independent aiming device for distal locking of intramedullary nails in a human cadaver model. METHODS: A new targeting system was used in 25 intact human cadaver femora for the distal locking procedure after insertion of an intramedullary nail. The number of successful screw placements and the time needed for this locking procedure were recorded. The accuracy of the aiming process was evaluated by computed tomography. RESULTS: The duration of the distal locking process was 8. 0 ± 1. 8 minutes (mean ± SD; range, 4 - 11 minutes). None of the screw placements required fluoroscopic guidance. Computed tomography revealed high accuracy of the locking process. The incidence angle (α) of the locking screws through the distal locking holes of the nail was 86. 8 ° ± 5. 0 ° (mean ± SD; range, 80 °- 96 °). Targeting failed in 1 static locking screw because of a material defect in the <b>drilling</b> <b>sleeve.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This cadaver study indicated that an aiming arm-based targeting device is highly reliable and accurate. The promising results suggest that it will help to decrease radiation exposure compared with the traditional "free-hand technique. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of oral rehabilitation, the {{combined}} use of 3 D imaging technologies and computer-guided approaches allows the development of reliable tools {{to be used in}} preoperative assessment of implant placement. In particular, the accurate transfer of the virtual planning into the operative field through surgical guides represents the main challenge of modern dental implantology. Guided implant positioning allows surgical and prosthetic approaches with minimal trauma by reducing treatment time and decreasing patient’s discomfort. This paper aims at defining a CAD/CAM framework for the accurate planning of flapless dental implant surgery. The system embraces three major applications: (1) freeform modelling, including 3 D tissue reconstruction and 2 D/ 3 D anatomy visualization, (2) computer-aided surgical planning and customised template modelling, (3) additive manufacturing of guided surgery template. The tissue modelling approach is based on the integration of two maxillofacial imaging techniques: tomographic scanning and surface optical scanning. A 3 D virtual maxillofacial model is created by matching radiographic data, captured by a CBCT scanner, and surface anatomical data, acquired by a structured light scanner. The pre-surgical planning process is carried out and controlled within the CAD application by referring to the integrated anatomical model. A surgical guide is then created by solid modelling and manufactured by additive techniques. Two different clinical cases have been approached by inserting 11 different implants. CAD-based planned fixture placements have been transferred into the clinical field by customised surgical guides, made of a biocompatible resin and equipped with <b>drilling</b> <b>sleeves...</b>|$|R
500|$|Wyoming {{finished}} her gunnery training duties in the Chesapeake area on 30 June 1945, {{when she left}} Norfolk for the New York Navy Yard, for further modifications.

30|$|Over 200 new {{external}} fixators {{are placed}} annually {{at the senior}} authors’ institution; the management of pin sites and pin site infections {{is an essential part}} of daily clinical practice. The prevention of infection protocol includes the following: intravenous antibiotics are given prior to skin incision and continued for 24 post-operatively; no tourniquet is used; and pins are inserted after pre-drilling with sharp <b>drills</b> using <b>sleeves</b> to protect soft tissues. Electrocautery is avoided at pin sites to prevent tissue necrosis. HA-coated tapered pins with cortical threads are used exclusively. For most applications, 6.0 -mm-diameter pins are used; however, 4.5 -mm pins are used in adult foot and forearm cases and for paediatric patients. Pin diameter is ensured to be < 33  % of the bone diameter. Pin site care starts on POD 2. Pin care is done once daily by cleaning each pin site with a new sterile cotton-tipped applicator that has been soaked in a solution of 1 : 1 hydrogen peroxide and normal saline. Dry sterile gauze is wrapped around each pin site. Daily showering is encouraged on POD 4 where the patients remove the dressings, allowing water to rinse the frame and use of an antibacterial liquid soap. The leg and frame are patted dry with a clean towel. Patients are allowed to swim in a chlorinated pool after 4  weeks. Most patients are allowed weight bearing as tolerated. Over time, some patients develop a non-infectious dermatitis for which we have learned that further dilution of the hydrogen peroxide solution is helpful. For example, instructions would be changed to use 1 part hydrogen peroxide and 3 parts normal saline.|$|R
