5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87â€“74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Putnam County's {{men began}} {{drafting}} into {{the armed forces}} to fight in the Vietnam War. In November of that year, Local Board No. 14 announced that 21 local men would be drafted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> the highest total to be called since the Korean War. Of the 21, two were residents of Patterson. To honor the Patterson veterans who lost their lives, a plaque commemorating the Vietnam War was added to the War Memorial by the American Legion at the intersection of NY311 and Maple Avenue.|$|E

50|$|This {{industrial}} {{innovation in the}} defence industry was adopted by Prussia in 1866 & 1870-71 in its defeat of Austria and France respectively. By this time the machine gun had begun entering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>militaries.</b> <b>The</b> first example of its effectiveness was in 1899 during the Boer War and in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. However, Germany were leaders in innovation of weapons and used this innovation nearly defeating the allies in World War I.|$|R
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E

5|$|No.3 Elementary Flying Training School (No.3 EFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot {{training}} {{unit that}} operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.3 EFTS was established in January 1940 at Essendon, Victoria, and initially included {{a significant proportion of}} civilian staff and private aircraft; by mid-year these had been largely integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> The school was disbanded in May 1942, its aircraft and instructional staff having been transferred to No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{economy was}} decentralized for its protection and large factories, {{located in the}} heavily populated Red River Delta region, were broken up and scattered into caves and small villages throughout the countryside. In the more heavily bombed southern panhandle, entire villages moved into underground tunnel complexes for the duration. Food shortages in North Vietnam became widespread, especially in the urban areas, as rice farmers went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> or volunteered for service repairing bomb damage. When the nation's transportation system came under attack, destroyed bridges were repaired or replaced by dirt fords, ferries, and underwater or pontoon bridges. The system proved to be durable, well built, easily repaired, and practically impossible to shut down.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also accepted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes {{to screen out}} male homosexuals, which had been in place since {{the creation of the}} American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the military in the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> installation as Mapes Road.|$|E
5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and he felt entering his son <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics. He graduated and commissioned in 1931.|$|E

5|$|Queen Ranavalona {{continued}} the military incursions initiated under Radama I to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to Merina rule. These policies had a strongly {{negative effect on}} economic and population growth during her reign. Fanompoana labor among the population of Imerina could include conscription <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers. This army, which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces, exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to Merina domination. Mass executions were common, {{and those who were}} spared their lives were commonly brought back to Imerina as slaves (andevo) and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the Crown. Approximately one million slaves entered Imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853, constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and two-thirds of all residents in Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the Lusaka Protocol in Lusaka, Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in Lusaka on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
