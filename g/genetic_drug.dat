40|$|Introduction: Resistance to second-line {{tuberculosis}} {{drugs is}} common, but slow to diagnose with phenotypic drug sensitivity testing. Rapid molecular tests speed up diagnosis, but can only detect limited mutations. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of culture isolates can generate a complete <b>genetic</b> <b>drug</b> resistance profile, but is delayed by the initial culture step. In the case presented here, successful WGS directly from sputum was achieved using targeted enrichment. Case report: A 29 -year-old Nigerian woman {{was diagnosed with}} tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF and Hain line probe assays identified rpoB and inhA mutations consistent with rifampicin and intermediate isoniazid resistance, and a further possible mutation conferring fluoroquinolone resistance. WGS directly from sputum identified a further inhA mutation consistent with high-level isoniazid resistance and confirmed the absence of fluoroquinolone resistance. Isoniazid was stopped, and the patient has completed 18 months of a fluoroquinolone-based regimen without relapse. Discussion: Compared to rapid molecular tests (which can only examine {{a limited number of}} mutations) and WGS of culture isolates (which requires a culture step), WGS directly from sputum can quickly generate a complete <b>genetic</b> <b>drug</b> resistance profile. In this case, WGS altered the clinical management of drug-resistant tuberculosis and demonstrated potential for guiding individualized drug treatment where second-line drug resistance is common...|$|E

40|$|Background: Resistance of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} to anti-tuberculosis (TB) {{drugs is}} almost exclusively due to spontaneous chromosomal mutations in target genes. Rapid de-tection of drug resistance to both first- and second-line anti-TB drugs {{has become a}} key component of TB control programs. Technologies that allow rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput detection of specific nucleic acid sequences are needed. This study was to develop a high-throughput assay based on allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) and MagPlex-TAG microspheres to detect anti-TB drug resistance mutations. Methods: DNA samples from 357 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates and H 37 Rv were ampli-fied by multiplex PCR using four primer sets, followed by multiplex ASPE using 23 TAG-ASPE primers.

For the sake of treatment development, over and above definitive genetic and cell-based therapies, there is considerable interest in drugs that target downstream disease mechanisms. Drug candidates have typically been chosen based {{on the nature of}} pathologic lesions and presumed underlying mechanisms and then tested in ani-malmodels. Mammalian dystrophinopathies have been charac-terized in mice (mdx mouse) and dogs (golden retriever {{muscular dystrophy}} [GRMD]).

Although the GRMD model offers a higher hurdle for translation, dogs have primarily been used to test genetic and cellular therapies where there is greater risk. Failed trans-lation of animal studies to DMD raises questions about the pro-priety of methods and models used to identify drug targets and test efficacy of pharmacologic intervention. The mdx mouse and GRMD dog are genetically homologous to DMD but not necessarily analogous. Subcellular species differences are undoubtedly magnified at the whole-body level in clinical trials.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether known <b>genetic,</b> <b>drug,</b> dietary, compliance, and lifestyle factors affecting clopidogrel absorption and metabolism fully account for the variability in clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. BackgroundPlatelet inhibition by clopidogrel is highly variable. Patients with reduced inhibition have increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. Identification of factors contributing to clopidogrel's variable response is needed to improve platelet inhibition and reduce risk for cardiovascular events. MethodsHealthy subjects (n = 160; ages 20 to 53 years; homozygous CYP 2 C 19 extensive metabolizer genotype; no nicotine for 6 weeks, prescription drugs for 4 weeks, over-the-counter drugs for 2 weeks, and no caffeine or alcohol for 72 h; confined; restricted diet) received clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 9 days, at which time clopidogrel pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints were measured. ResultsAt steady-state, clopidogrel active metabolite (clopidogrelAM) pharmacokinetics varied widely between subjects (coefficients of variation [CVs] 33. 8 % and 40. 2 % for clopidogrelAM area under the time-concentration curve and peak plasma concentration, respectively). On-treatment vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein P 2 Y 12 platelet reactivity index (PRI), maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) to adenosine phosphate, and VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 platelet response units (PRU) also varied widely (CVs 32 % to 53 %). All identified factors together accounted for only 18 % of intersubject variation in pharmacokinetic parameters and 32 % to 64 % of intersubject variation in PRI, MPA, and PRU. High on-treatment platelet reactivity was present in 45 % of subjects. ConclusionsClopidogrel pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics vary widely despite rigorous exclusion or control of known disease, polymorphisms (CYP 2 C 19, CYP 3 A 5, ABCB 1, PON 1), noncompliance, co-medications, diet, smoking, alcohol, demographics, and pre-treatment platelet hyperreactivity.

The general aim of this thesis was therefore to develop and validate a new classification method of functional remission in a naturalistic population of {{patients with}} psychosis and to utilize this classification to investigate the population from <b>genetic,</b> <b>drug</b> treatment, insight and social network points of view. Data for this cross-sectional study of patients (n= 123) attending the Psychosis Outpatient Care clinic in the county of Jönköping, Sweden, were obtained from patient interviews, blood samples and information from patient files. The new classification method CANSEPT, which combines the CAN rating scale (CAN), the UKU side effect rating scale (SE) and the patient’s previous treatment history (PT), showed validity in discriminating the patients and was accepted well by the patients. CANSEPT was used to group the patients in the other studies in this thesis. The results indicated that the gene polymorphism ABCB 1 3435 T, was related to worse significant social and clinical needs for patients on olanzapine, while the polymorphism DRD 2 Taq 1 A 1 was related to a greater risk of significant side effects; especially if male, or taking strong dopamine D 2 -receptor antagonistic drugs. Drug treatment factors were also related to treatment response; longer duration of untreated prodromal and early psychosis was seen for patients with current significant social and clinical needs and non-adherence to treatment was associated with worse significant side effects. Worse treatment outcomes also appeared to be associated with smaller social network groups, worse insight into illness, poorer knowledge of warning signs and worse coping strategies. In summary, CANSEPT was shown to be a useful valid, multidimensional tool for classification of treatment response. Gene polymorphisms, duration of untreated illness, non-adherence to treatment, social networks and knowledge should be taken into consideration when investigating inadequate treatment response...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Molecular {{monitoring}} of parasite resistance {{has become an}} important complementary tool in establishing rational anti-malarial drug policies. Community surveys provide {{a representative sample of}} the parasite population and can be carried out more rapidly than accrual of samples from clinical cases, but it is not known whether the frequencies of genetic resistance markers in clinical cases differ from those in the overall population, or whether such community surveys can provide good predictions of treatment failure rates. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, in vivo drug efficacy of amodiaquine or chloroquine plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine was determined at three sites in Papua New Guinea. The <b>genetic</b> <b>drug</b> resistance profile (i. e., 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum crt, mdr 1, dhfr, dhps, and ATPase 6) was concurrently assessed in 639 community samples collected in the catchment areas of the respective health facilities by using a DNA microarray-based method. Mutant allele and haplotype frequencies were determined and their relationship with treatment failure rates at each site in each year was investigated. RESULTS: PCR-corrected in vivo treatment failure rates were between 12 % and 28 % and varied by site and year with variable longitudinal trends. In the community samples, the frequencies of mutations in pfcrt and pfmdr 1 were high and did not show significant changes over time. Mutant allele frequencies in pfdhfr were moderate and those in pfdhps were low. No mutations were detected in pfATPase 6. There was much more variation between sites than temporal, within-site, variation in allele and haplotype frequencies. This variation did not correlate well with treatment failure rates. Allele and haplotype frequencies were very similar in clinical and community samples from the same site. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between parasite genetics and in vivo treatment failure rate is not straightforward. The frequencies of genetic anti-malarial resistance markers appear to be very similar in community and clinical samples, but cannot be used to make precise predictions of clinical outcome. Thus, indicators based on molecular data have to be considered with caution and interpreted in the local context, especially with regard to prior drug usage and level of pre-existing immunity. Testing community samples for molecular drug resistance markers is a complementary tool that should help decision-making for the best treatment options and appropriate potential alternatives...|$|E
