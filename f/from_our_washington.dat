They have {{for the last two}} days been moving about in front, and {{apparently}} want us to believe that they intend to cross somewhere below the town; but all the news we get <b>from</b> <b>our</b> spies is to the effect that these are only feints and that they intend to throw a bridge across here. We know, anyhow, they have got two trains concealed opposite, near the river. Burnside is likely to find it a hard nut to crack. Of course they are superior in number to us, as they always are; but as we have always beat them well on level ground I do not think their chances of getting up these heights are by any means hopeful. Then, too, their change of commanders is against them. McClellan fought a drawn battle against us at Antietam and showed himself a really able general in the operations in front of Richmond. The army have confidence in him, and he is by far the best man they have got so far, but the fools at Washington have now for the second time displaced him because they are jealous of him. Burnside has shown himself a good man in minor commands, but I don't think he is equal to command such a vast army as this; and besides, we know <b>from</b> <b>our</b> friends at <b>Washington</b> that he has protested against this advance across the river, but has been overruled. You will see Fredericksburg will add another to the long list of our victories." ...|$|R

6000|$|Sulgrave {{remained}} in the family until 1620, and was commonly called [...] "Washington's manor." [...] [Footnote: The manor of Garsdon in Wiltshire has been mentioned as the homestead of the ancestors of <b>our</b> <b>Washington.</b> This is a mistake. It was the residence of Sir Laurence Washington, second son of the above-mentioned grantee of Sulgrave. Elizabeth, granddaughter of this Sir Laurence, married Robert Shirley, Earl Ferrers and Viscount of Tamworth. Washington became a baptismal name among the Shirleys--several of the Earls Ferrers have borne it.|$|R
6000|$|At length news arrived {{that the}} king had issued an order for the {{surrender}} of all towns, castles, and forts. A printed copy of the order was shown to Sir Henry, and on the faith of that document he capitulated (19th July, 1646) on honorable terms, won by his fortitude and perseverance. Those who believe in hereditary virtues may see foreshadowed {{in the conduct of}} this Washington of Worcester, the magnanimous constancy of purpose, the disposition to [...] "hope against hope," [...] which bore <b>our</b> <b>Washington</b> triumphantly through the darkest days of our revolution.|$|R

5000|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in society. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, including increased self-esteem and community solidarity. The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. The letter addressed to [...] "Everyone in <b>our</b> <b>Washington</b> Redskins Nation" [...] in 2013 by {{the owner of the}} Washington Redskins, Daniel Snyder; explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping a team name.|$|R

His lavender [...] gloves might have been stolen from some Turkish harem, so delicate [...] were they in size; but more likely--anything else were more likely [...] than that. In form and feature he bears some resemblance to the [...] immortal Nasby; but whilst Petroleum is brunette to the core, Twain [...] is golden, amber-hued, melting, blonde." ...|$|R
