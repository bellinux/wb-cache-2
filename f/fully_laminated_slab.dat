30|$|The fast {{progress}} {{in the field of}} stem cell research, including differentiation of stem cells into <b>fully</b> <b>laminated</b> three-dimensional retinal cups [114], as well as generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from retinoblastoma patients [115], offer new tools for mimicking the origin and tumorigenesis of retinoblastoma. RB 1 -null human embryonic stem cells, generated using CRISPR/Cas 9, were shown to form large teratomas with characteristics similar to trilateral retinoblastoma tumors and were proposed as a platform for studying mitochondrial phenotyping, in vivo tumorigenesis, and drug screening [116]. Other interesting models may soon become available. For example, an in vitro human retinal organoid system could be used to replicate the genetic and cellular events that normally take place in utero. Previous attempts to generate a similar model [117] failed to induce Rb expression in maturing cone precursors and further efforts are necessary. A platform for initiation of retinoblastoma in a developing human retina in vitro would allow unique freedom to test various temporal settings for the mutagenic events e.g. loss of RB 1 function on different levels or gain of a MYCN or OTX 2 amplification at different steps in retinal development. By looking at the behavior of specific retinal cell types following these events in this human retinal cup system it could be possible to narrow down the search for the cell-of-origin. Finally, this platform could act as a more precise human-specific drug-screening platform.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in zebrafish retinal development and myelination. METHODS: Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO), which are complementary to the translation start site of the wild-type embryonic zebrafish TNF-α mRNA sequence, were synthesized and injected into one- to four-cell embryos. The translation blocking specificity was verified by Western blotting using an anti-TNF-α antibody, whole-mount in situ hybridization using a hepatocyte-specific mRNA probe ceruloplasmin (cp), and co-injection of TNF-α MO and TNF-α mRNA. An atonal homolog 7 (atoh 7) mRNA probe was used to detect neurogenesis onset. The retinal neurodifferentiation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies Zn 12, Zpr 1, and Zpr 3 to label ganglion cells, cones, and rods, respectively. Myelin basic protein (mbp) {{was used as a}} marker to track and observe the myelination using whole-mount in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Targeted knockdown of TNF-α resulted in specific suppression of TNF-α expression and a severely underdeveloped liver. The co-injection of TNF-α MO and mRNA rescued the liver development. Retinal neurogenesis in TNF-α morphants was initiated on time. The retina was <b>fully</b> <b>laminated,</b> while ganglion cells, cones, and rods were well differentiated at 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf). mbp was expressed in Schwann cells in the lateral line nerves and cranial nerves from 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) as well as in oligodendrocytes linearly along the hindbrain bundles and the spinal cord from 4 dpf, which closely resembled its endogenous profile.

40|$|The gene coding for centrosomal protein 290 (CEP 290), a large multidomain protein, is {{the most}} {{frequently}} mutated gene underlying the non-syndromic blinding disorder Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). CEP 290 has also been implicated in several cilia-related syndromic disorders including Meckel–Gruber syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Senor–Loken syndrome and Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS). In this study, we characterize the developmental and functional roles of cep 290 in zebrafish. An antisense oligonucleotide [Morpholino (MO) ], designed to generate an altered cep 290 splice product that models the most common LCA mutation, was used for gene knockdown. We show that cep 290 MO-injected embryos have reduced Kupffer's vesicle size and delays in melanosome transport, two phenotypes that are observed upon knockdown of bbs genes in zebrafish. Consistent with a role in cilia function, the cep 290 MO-injected embryos exhibited a curved body axis. Patients with LCA caused by mutations in CEP 290 have reduced visual perception, although they present with a <b>fully</b> <b>laminated</b> retina. Similarly, the histological examination of retinas from cep 290 MO-injected zebrafish revealed no gross lamination defects, yet the embryos had a statistically significant reduction in visual function. Finally, we demonstrate that the vision impairment caused by the disruption of cep 290 can be rescued by expressing only the N-terminal region of the human CEP 290 protein. These data reveal that a specific region of the CEP 290 protein is sufficient to restore visual function and this region may be a viable gene therapy target for LCA patients with mutations in CEP 290...|$|R

40|$|Marsupials {{are unique}} models for {{developmental}} biology-oriented research {{because of the}} immature state of their development at birth. The North American opossum (Didelphis virginiana) has several advantages over other marsupials, including large litter size, short prenatal period (12. 5 d), an extended postnatal period while accessible in the pouch, {{and its ability to}} reproduce reliably in captivity. Studies of ocular development in this species have not been reported previously. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to document the major landmarks in prenatal and postnatal development of the cornea, lens, iris, ciliary body and retina. Fifteen embryos (10. 5, 10. 7 and 11 d postconception and 6 h after birth [12 d]) were studied by paraffin histology. Eyes of pouch young at 8 d, 2, 6, 9 and 13 wk were studied by transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. The study revealed a similar pattern of ocular development in Didelphis to other metatherian and eutherian mammals. Differentiation of the eye is particularly rapid in the 2 d before birth. For example, although the lens vesicle separates from the surface ectoderm on d 10, by birth (2. 5 d later) a primitive cornea and fused eyelids have formed, presumably to protect the eye during migration to the pouch. At birth the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contains melanin; however, the inner layer of the optic cup does not differentiate into an inner and outer neuroblastic layer until 8 d after birth. Around 6 wk after birth most components of the adult eye are identifiable, albeit in an immature form. These include the corneal layers, the iris (including the sphincter pupillae), ciliary processes, RPE tapetum, and a <b>fully</b> <b>laminated</b> retina with immature photoreceptors.

40|$|Tapered {{designs are}} {{currently}} certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations: two terminations to maintain balanced construction and a further two terminations to maintain symmetry. This constraint is often violated in practice, leading to localised thermal warping; {{the effects of}} which {{have yet to be}} quantified. An obvious, but somewhat controversial strategy for ‘thin laminate’ designs, with traditional uni-directional (UD) material, is to adopt unbalanced and/or nonsymmetric stacking sequence configurations to fully exploit the available design space, particularly where tapered designs are a requirement. This extended design space has previously been shown to contain warp-free <b>laminates</b> with either <b>fully</b> uncoupled mechanical properties or with Extension-Shearing and/or BendingTwisting coupling behaviour. Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment. Bending-Twisting coupling, which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent <b>fully</b> uncoupled <b>laminate</b> (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Recent studies on Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupled laminates have provided useful insight into the available design space for tapered laminates with single angle-ply or cross-ply terminations. Similar tailoring strategies are now applied to unconventional tapered laminate designs (i. e. those free from the ubiquitous symmetric and balanced, or un-balanced, design constraint) with two-ply terminations, to investigate the extent to which angleply layers can be terminated without introducing Extension-Shearing coupling, or the extent to which angle- and cross-ply combinations can be terminated to tailor or maintain Extension-Shearing throughout the tapered laminate. Consideration is also given to the potential effectiveness of introducing tailored mechanical coupling through ply terminations, e. g. to induce bending-twisting coupling in a wing-tip or winglet, using Extension-Shearing coupling at the laminate level, whilst maintaining <b>fully</b> uncoupled <b>laminate</b> behaviour in the tapered skins elsewhere in the wing-box...|$|R
