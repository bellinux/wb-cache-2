50|$|Boxer primers {{are similar}} to Berdan primers with one major difference: the {{location}} of the anvil. In a Boxer primer, the anvil is a separate stirrup piece that sits inverted in the primer cup providing sufficient resistance to the impact of the firing pin as it indents the cup and crushes the pressure-sensitive ignition compound. The primer pocket in the case head has a single flash-hole in its center. This positioning makes little or no difference to the performance of the round, but it makes fired primers vastly easier to remove for re-loading, as a single, centered rod pushed through the flash hole from the open end of the case will eject the two-piece primer from the primer cup. A new primer, anvil included, is then pressed into the case using a reloading press or <b>hand-tool.</b> Boxer priming is universal for US-manufactured civilian factory ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|A brayer is a <b>hand-tool</b> used {{historically}} in {{printing and}} printmaking {{to break up}} and [...] "rub out" [...] (spread) ink before it was [...] "beaten" [...] using inking balls or composition rollers. The word {{is derived from the}} verb to [...] "bray", meaning [...] "to break, pound, or grind small, as in a mortar". A brayer consists of a short wooden cylinder with a handle fitted to one end; the other, flat end is used to rub the ink. In the late nineteenth century the term was mis-applied in the United States to a small hand-roller, [...] "used for spreading ink on the inking table, and for applying it to the distributing plates or rollers connected with presses". Such small rollers were sold as [...] "brayers" [...] from at least 1912 and later in the century the term was applied in the U.S.A. to hand-rollers of all sorts and sizes. It retains its original meaning in Europe.|$|E

Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with natural dyes, and hand-marbled papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is <b>hand-tooled</b> in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such <b>hand-tooling,</b> where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover.

5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered socket wrenches which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the <b>hand-tool</b> variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{a profit}} {{function}} approach with farm-level survey data from Burkina Faso {{to estimate the}} supply responsiveness of farm households to changes in prices and non-price factors, for individual crops and aggregate output. The sample is stratified first by agro-ecological zone and then, with an endogenous partition, into animal traction and manual (<b>hand-tool)</b> households. Three main conclusions emerge. First, the results {{run counter to the}} common pessimism regarding Sahel agriculture's ability to respond to better incentives (such as those created by the recent devaluation of the CFA franc) particularly for cash cropping. Second, aggregate output responds positively to increases in the price of currently commercialized crops (cotton and maize) among traction households in the zone with the most favourable agro-climate, the Guinean zone thus averting the fear that price increases only lead to crop mix shifts. Third, absolute levels of response for cash crops and for aggregate output are much higher where non-price factors are propitious specifically, in the favourable agro-climate and among animal traction households that use fertilizer. Supply response is more limited in less favourable agro-climates and among households limited to <b>hand-tool</b> technologies. The results underscore the greater flexibility of the animal traction farmers to respond to economic incentives for cotton and maize. Donor and government programmes that promote animal traction and fertilizer adoption can via agrarian capital formation reduce structural constraints to farmer response to macro incentives. vo...|$|E

They were also an experimental demonstration of an extended cognitive system. We generated and then temporarily disrupted an interaction- dominant system that spans a human participant, a computer mouse, and a task performed on the computer screen. Our claim that this system was interaction dominant was based on the detection of 1 /f noise at the <b>hand-tool</b> interface. The inference from the presence of 1 /f noise to the presence of an interaction-dominant system is occasionally disputed. Increasing evidence suggests that inference from multifractality to interaction dominance is more certain than 1 /flike scaling alone. In this paper, we reanalyze the data using the wavelet transform modulus maxima method, showing that the human-mouse system displays multifractality. This reinforces our claims that the system is interaction dominant...|$|E

Forty-six forestry workers not using chain saws were used as controls. The prevalence rates of symptoms were checked and statistically compared in each group. In the group with under 2000 hours' experience, symptoms were generally confined to tingling, numbness, or pain; with 2000 - 5000 hours peripheral nerve and circulatory disturbances, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and muscle and general body conditions were influenced to some degree; with 5000 - 8000 hours' functional changes were noted; while with over 8000 hours about half the operators suffered severely from functional or organic changes due to vibration...|$|E

40|$|Catabola {{municipality}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} damaged areas of civil war in Angola. Although the climatic as well as soil conditions are favorable for intensive agriculture, small farmers in the municipality are subsistence with the main income source of dried beans, dried cassava and vegetables. <b>Hand-tool</b> technology prevails in the Catabola municipality as it is employed in 95. 38 % of the cultivated land of small farmers. The majority of small farmers uses only power of their family members (with a mean of 1. 80 kW and standard deviation of 2. 37 kW), hired labour is used by 38. 0 % of small farmers. In addition, high engagement of child work was found out as 63. 88 % of the children age 5 - 14 are involved in field operations. Primary data collection was conducted in the Catabola municipality in the period July - August 2011, semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions were the most frequent methods used. In total, 151 small scale farmers out of 9 villages participated in the survey. 10 factors that influence the dependent variable [...] type of farmer regarding technology used on field in combination with hiring of extra labour [...] were defined. The factors were statistically analyzed with use of ANOVA. Out of the factors expected to influence adoption of more sophisticated technologies than the <b>hand-tool,</b> increasing in size of the cultivated land and enhancement of education of both parents and children are found to be the limiting factor in the adoption process for use of animal traction or mechanical power from small farmers in the Catabola municipality. Strategy was formulated with use of simplified quantified SWOT analysis separately for animal-draught and mechanical-power technologies. The result can be interpreted as 8. 0 % assumption of success in animal traction adoption, contrary to 10. 1 % assumption of failures in mechanization adoption by small farmers in the Catabola municipality. Thus, tractors are not considered as an appropriate technology for small farmers in the Catabola municipality. The most critical criteria in animal traction adoption that should be considered are support of farmers' cooperatives and associations, FFSs, education in the form of general schooling as well as trainings for farmers, blacksmiths, extension workers and animal breeders...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSub-Saharan African {{women on}} small-acreage farms carry a disproportionately higher labor burden, {{which is one}} of the main reasons they are unable to produce for both home and the market and realize higher incomes. Labor-saving {{interventions}} such as hand-tools are needed to save time and/or increase productivity in, for example, land preparation for crop and animal agriculture, post-harvest processing, and meeting daily energy and water needs. Development of such tools requires comprehensive and content-specific anthropometric data or body dimensions and existing databases based on Western women may be less relevant. We conducted measurements on 89 women to provide preliminary results toward answering two questions. First, how well existing databases are applicable in the design of hand-tools for sub-Saharan African women. Second, how universal body dimension predictive models are among ethnic groups. Our results show that, body dimensions between Bantu and Nilotic ethnolinguistic groups are different and both are different from American women.

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a percussive chipping hammer together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled <b>hand-tool</b> system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the <b>hand-tool</b> model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|E
