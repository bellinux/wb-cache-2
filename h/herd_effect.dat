5000|$|Herd immunity, or <b>herd</b> <b>effect,</b> {{refers to}} the {{indirect}} protection that immunized community members provide to non-immunized members in preventing the spread of contagious disease. The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity {{is known as a}} dependent happening because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection. The proportion of immune individuals in a population above which a disease may no longer persist is the herd immunity threshold. Its value varies with the virulence of the disease, the efficacy of the vaccine, and the contact parameter for the population.

The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) has been available on the private market in Taiwan since October 2005. To date, {{there has not been}} any cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of PCV 7 in Taiwan. A pharmacoeconomic model populated with local parameters is needed for vaccine decision-making. The aim {{of the study was to}} provide a CEA of PCV 7 in Taiwan and explore the impact of <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> and indirect cost on the findings of CEA. Methods: A decision analytic model was populated with local epidemiological and economic data to simulate the expected clinical and economic outcomes from a hypothetical vaccinated birth cohort of 191, 310 infants compared to no vaccination over a 10 -year time horizon. To explore the impact of <b>herd</b> <b>effect,</b> results were presented with and without <b>herd</b> <b>effect.</b> Moreover, the study was conducted from both payer and societal perspectives to examine the impact of indirect cost. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. The cost-effectiveness of a reduced three-dose schedule was also estimated. Results: PCV 7 vaccination could prevent 1281 cases of invasive pneumococcal diseases, 178, 145 cases of all-cause hospitalized pneumonia, 69, 962 cases of all-cause acute otitis media, and 981 deaths over a 10 -year time horizon. The vaccination program with an annual cost of NT$ 1, 950. 5 million could lead to 15. 4 % reduction in direct medical costs of NT$ 6, 010 million and 64. 1 % reduction in indirect costs of NT$ 9, 467 million. The vaccination with a four-dose schedule would lead to an incremental cost of NT$ 1, 183, 028 per life-year gained from the payer perspective and NT$ 619, 862 per life-year gained from the societal perspective. Conclusion: Taking <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> and indirect costs into account, PCV 7 vaccination is cost-effective in Taiwan.

40|$|Abstract Background Indirect <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> from {{vaccination}} {{of children}} offers potential {{for improving the}} effectiveness of influenza prevention in the remaining unvaccinated population. Static models used in cost-effectiveness analyses cannot dynamically capture herd effects. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology to allow <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> associated with vaccinating children against seasonal influenza to be incorporated into static models evaluating the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination. Methods Two previously published linear equations for approximation of herd effects in general were compared with the results of a structured literature review undertaken using PubMed searches to identify data on herd effects specific to influenza vaccination. A linear function was fitted to point estimates from the literature using the sum of squared residuals. Results The literature review identified 21 publications on 20 studies for inclusion. Six studies provided data on a mathematical relationship between effective vaccine coverage in subgroups and reduction of influenza infection in a larger unvaccinated population. These supported a linear relationship when effective vaccine coverage in a subgroup population was between 20 % and 80 %. Three studies evaluating <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> at a community level, specifically induced by vaccinating children, provided point estimates for fitting linear equations. The fitted linear equation for herd protection in the target population for vaccination (children) was slightly less conservative than a previously published equation for herd effects in general. The fitted linear equation for herd protection in the non-target population was considerably less conservative than the previously published equation. Conclusions This method of approximating <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> requires simple adjustments to the annual baseline risk of influenza in static models: (1) for the age group targeted by the childhood vaccination strategy (i. e. children); and (2) for other age groups not targeted (e. g. adults and/or elderly). Two approximations provide a linear relationship between effective coverage and reduction in the risk of infection. The first is a conservative approximation, recommended as a base-case for cost-effectiveness evaluations. The second, fitted to data extracted from a structured literature review, provides a less conservative estimate of <b>herd</b> <b>effect,</b> recommended for sensitivity analyses. </p...|$|E
40|$|Survival {{analysis}} {{techniques for}} sire-maternal grand- sire (MGS) and animal models {{were used to}} test the genetic evaluation of longevity in a Slovenian Brown cattle population characterized by small herds. Three genetic models were compared: a sire-MGS model for bulls and an approximate animal model based on estimated breeding values (EBV) from the sire-MGS model for cows, an animal model, and an animal model based on the estimated variance components from the sire-MGS model. In addition, modeling the contemporary group effect was defined as either a herd or a herd-year (HY) effect. With various restrictions on the minimum HY group size (from 1 to 10 cows per HY), changes in estimates of variance components, and consequently also in EBV, were observed for the sire-MGS and animal models. Variance of contemporary group effects decreased when an HY effect was fitted instead of a <b>herd</b> <b>effect.</b> In the case of a sire-MGS model, estimates of additive genetic variance were mostly robust to changes in minimum HY group size or fitting herd or HY effect, whereas they increased in the animal model when HY instead of herd effects was fitted, possibly revealing some confounding between cow EBV and con- temporary group effect. Estimated heritabilities from sire-MGS models were between 0. 091 and 0. 119 and were mainly influenced by the restriction on the HY group size. Estimated heritabilities from animal models were higher: between 0. 125 and 0. 160 when <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> was fitted and between 0. 171 and 0. 210 when HY effect was fitted. Rank correlations between the animal model and the approximate animal model based on EBV from the sire-MGS model were high: 0. 94 for cows and 0. 93 for sires when a <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> was fitted and 0. 90 for cows and 0. 93 for sires when an HY effect was fitted. Validation performed on the independent validation data set revealed that the correlation between sire EBV and daughter survival were slightly higher with the approximate animal model based on EBV from the sire-MGS model compared with the animal model. The correlations between the sire EBV and daughter survival were higher when the model included an HY effect instead of a <b>herd</b> <b>effect.</b> To avoid confounding and reduce computational requirements, it is suggested that the approximate animal model based on EBV from the sire-MGS model and HY as a contemporary group effect is an interesting compromise for practical applications of genetic evaluation of longevity in cattle populations...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{framework}} for estimating production losses and monetary costs of generic clinical mastitis (CM) was developed and possible applications were demonstrated. Milk Losses were estimated from 5 large, high producing, dairy herds that used automatic recording of daily milk yields by using mixed models, with a random <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> and an autoregressive covariance structure to account for repeated measurements. Generalized mixed models, with a random <b>herd</b> <b>effect,</b> were used to quantify the effect of CM on mortality and culling. Generalized mixed models, with a random <b>herd</b> <b>effect,</b> were used to estimate the conditional risks for the first 3 CM occurrences. A specially structured optimization and simulation model based on multilevel hierarchical Markov process that included a detailed representation of repeated episodes of CM was used to {{study the effects of}} various factors on the cost of CM. The average cost of CM in our study herds was $ 179. In the basic scenario 92 % of the CM cases were recommended to be treated. The estimated cost of CM was highly dependent on cow traits (range: $ 3 -$ 403), and moderately on exogenous factors. The costs of following sub optimal replacement policies were evaluated, such as a decision to treat all cows with CM or replacing all cows after their 3 rd CM case. The cost-benefit of applying two fictitious vaccinations were calculated. Comparing expected net present values obtained from the model for cows with similar traits but differing in CM state and pregnancy status can assist the farmer in making quantitative economic CM treatment decisions. Current information technology as online individual cow milk recording systems and detailed herd management programs enable individual farm estimations in a growing number of dairy farms. The developed dynamic optimization and simulation model with its user interface enables gaining insight into disease costs under farm specific conditions.

We considered solely hrHPV infections, thus avoiding the confounding effects of disease progression, screening, and treatments. To analyse hrHPV epidemiology and to estimate the overall impact of vaccination against infections with hrHPVs, we developed a dynamic compartmental transmission model for single and multiple infections with 14 hrHPV types. The infection-related parameters were estimated using population-based sexual behaviour and hrHPV prevalence data from Finland. The analysis disclosed {{the important role of}} persistent infections in hrHPV epidemiology, provided further evidence for a significant natural immunity, and demonstrated the dependence of transmission probability estimates on the model structure. The model predicted that vaccinating girls at 80 % coverage will result in a 55 % reduction in the overall hrHPV prevalence and a higher 65 % reduction in the prevalence of persistent hrHPV infections in females. In males, the reduction will be 42 % in the hrHPV prevalence solely by the <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> from the 80 % coverage in girls. If such high coverage among girls is not reached, it is still possible to reduce the female hrHPV prevalence indirectly by the <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> if also boys are included in the vaccination program. On the other hand, any herd effects in older unvaccinated cohorts were minor.

Special emphasis is given to the <b>herd</b> <b>effect.</b> We analyzed direct medical and non-medical costs of RV infection for Social Health Insurance between 2007 and 2010 based on 360, 000 routine data observations from the AOK PLUS for children below 5 years of age. We compared the actual annual number of RV cases (vacci-nation scenario) with the number derived from 2005 (no vaccination, base case scenario). The vaccination coverage rate has increased from 5 % to 61 % between 2007 and 2010. The number of RV cases decreased by 21 % from 32, 274 in 2007 to 25, 614 in 2010. Based on vaccination coverage, the total cost savings per 1, 000 children due to RV vaccination was estimated to be 39, 686 Euros. The overall share of outpatient costs was 60 %. Mean gross cost savings were expected to be 304 Euros per avoided case. The net cost savings were expected to be 19 Euros per avoided case. About 59 % of total savings was due to herd protection resulting from increasing vaccine rates. The <b>herd</b> <b>effect</b> per avoided case increased with increasing vaccine coverage.

Implementation of 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) in the Dutch national immunization program for infants led to a shift from vaccine to non-vaccine serotypes (i. e. replacement disease) in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). This shift was observed in all age groups, including non-vaccinated persons, due to indirect effects. Indirect were caused by a reduction in nasopharyngeal colonization of vaccine serotypes in children and subsequent transmission (i. e. <b>herd</b> <b>effects).</b> Also after PCV 7 {{was replaced by a}} 10 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 10) we observed <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> for extra serotypes covered by PCV 10. Replacement disease following PCVs was primarily caused by expansion of pre-existing non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) rather than capsular switch variants. Despite replacement disease IPD incidence has decreased dramatically in children < 5 year old. Also in elderly aged 65 and older net IPD incidence decreased. The magnitude of <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> and extent of disease caused by NVT strains was different between sexes in particular among 20 – 39 year-olds. Though these differences were subtle gender is an epidemiological factor to consider in the surveillance of IPD. Shifts in serotypes coincided with changes in clinical syndromes in IPD (i. e. increase in empyema incidence) and outcomes (i. e. decreased IPD case-fatality) for the post-PCV 7 period. Also we showed that despite <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> underlying conditions such as chronic lung or cardiovascular disease and HIV/AIDS persist as important risk factors for IPD in the post-PCV 7 period. In addition, the long-term mortality after pneumococcal pneumonia remained high. The impact of PCVs on the microbiological aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalised adults for other pathogens than S. pneumoniae was unchanged. Potential disturbances of PCVs on the nasopharyngeal microbiome therefore do not seem to translate into a higher proportion of other pathogens in the aetiology of CAP. At last, we vaccinated former pneumococcal CAP patients and former CAP patients infected by another other identified pathogen. In both groups 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) was immunogenic...|$|R

40|$|The {{willingness}} to migrate and locational choice {{may be influenced}} by others' choices or plans, particularly if the "other people," such as family and friends, are migrants, former migrants, or potential migrants themselves. We examine the roles "other people" play in influencing an individual's potential migration decision. In analyzing the influence of others on migration decisions, we rely on the concepts of migration networks and <b>herd</b> <b>effects.</b> Copyright � 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation � 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|The Hong Kong Standard Chartered Marathon, held annually, {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{international}} marathon events. Its primarily urban environmental setting characterized by high-density urban areas, semienclosed tunnels, and suspension bridges, together with the herds of runners, has an influence on the microclimate along the marathon course. This study focused on assessing and comparing variations in temperature and vapour pressure (vis-à-vis relative humidity) against the crowd of runners, or the <b>herd</b> <b>effects,</b> in two different environmental settings along the marathon course: semienclosed (a tunnel) versus open space (a suspension bridge). A series of small iButtons were deployed at strategic locations along the course to undertake minute-by-minute measurements of temperature and relative humidity. It was found that <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> of varying degrees were present in both semienclosed and open settings. Various environmental differences also played a role in ameliorating or amplifying the climatological <b>effects</b> of the <b>herd</b> of runners. Our study suggests that microclimate variations in different environmental settings and crowd conditions could have an impact on runners. This new knowledge can inform the design of marathon routes. It also establishes the feasibility of employing the iButton logging sensors for widespread deployment and monitoring of meteorological situations...|$|R
40|$|Bexsero, a new vaccine against {{serogroup}} B meningococcal disease (MenB), was licensed in Europe in January 2013. In Germany, Bexsero {{is recommended}} for persons at increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease, but not for universal childhood vaccination. To support decision making we adapted the independently developed model for England to the German setting to predict the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination with Bexsero(®) against MenB disease. We used both cohort and transmission dynamic mathematical models, the latter allowing for <b>herd</b> <b>effects,</b> to consider the impact of vaccination on individuals aged 0 - 99 years. Vaccination strategies included infant and adolescent vaccination, alone or in combination, and with one-off catch-up programmes. German specific data were used where possible from routine surveillance data and the literature. We assessed the impact of vaccination through cases averted and quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained and calculated costs per QALY gained. Assuming 65 % vaccine uptake and 82 % strain coverage, infant vaccination was estimated to prevent 15 % (34) of MenB cases over the lifetime of one birth cohort. Including <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> from vaccination increased the cases averted by infant vaccination to 22 %, with an estimated 8461 infants requiring vaccination to prevent one case. In the short term the greatest health benefit is achieved through routine infant vaccination with large-scale catch-up, which could reduce cases by 24. 9 % after 5 years and 27. 9 % after 10 years. In the long term (20 + years) policies including routine adolescent vaccination are most favourable if <b>herd</b> <b>effects</b> are assumed. Under base case assumptions with a vaccine list price of € 96. 96 the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was >€ 500, 000 per QALY for all considered strategies. Given the current very low incidence of MenB disease in Germany, universal vaccination with Bexsero(®) would prevent only a small absolute number of cases, at a high overall cost.
