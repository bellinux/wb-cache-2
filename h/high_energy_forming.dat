The innovative hybrid impact hydro-forming (IHF) technology {{is a kind of}} <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>forming</b> technique. It combines hydroforming and <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>forming,</b> which first use hydro-forming to shape large character of product, then use high energy to form small features, such as convex tables, bars etc. The present work investigates the shock wave generation of hybrid impact hydroforming. In this paper, the theory of shock wave is presented and finite element simulation was carried out by using MSC. The pressure distribution changes in the depth direction, but not in the width direction. Using this shock wave loading condition we did forming experiments. Punching occurred as a result of combined tensile and shear stress effects. Furthermore, the design precise of die and clearance between punch and die may less strict. Therefore, the research is very useful for the development and application of hybrid impact hydroforming...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The {{innovative}} hybrid impact hydroforming (IHF) {{technology is}} a kind of <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>forming</b> technique which can be used for forming complex parts with small features, such as convex tables, bars etc. which are widely employed in automotive and aircraft industries. The impact hydroforming technology means the most features are formed by hydroforming and the small features are rapidly reshaped by high intensity impact energy {{in a very short time}} after the traditional hydroforming. The impact pressure rises to the peak in 10 ms which belongs to dynamic loading. The present work investigates IHF using a numerical /experimental approach. Finite element simulations using MSC. Patran were carried out changing the geometrical shape of liquid hammer [...] Using this shock wave loading condition we did forming experiments. During forming process, stress distribution in the blank is comparatively better as compared with traditional methods so possibility of fracture is reduced. Inertia is also an important factor which affects control quality. Therefore, the research is very useful for improving forming quality of complicated products. It will be widely applied in automotive and aircraft industries...|$|E

Studies suggest that the interactions between the excited state product and nearby residues can force the oxyluciferin into an even <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>form,</b> which results in the emission of green light. For example, Arg 218 has electrostatic interactions with other nearby residues, restricting oxyluciferin from tautomerizing to the enol form. [...] Similarly, other results have indicated that the microenvironment of luciferase can force oxyluciferin into a more rigid, high-energy structure, forcing it to emit a high-energy green light.|$|R
40|$|<b>High</b> <b>energy</b> rate <b>forming</b> 'powder-in-tube' {{techniques}} were employed for near net-shape manufacturing of axisymmetric metal/superconducting YBCO ceramic compound billets for {{applications in the}} electrical industry. The dynamic techniques employed were explosive and electromagnetic compaction. The macro- and microscopic integrity of the components {{and the effect of}} the compaction process on the superconducting properties were examined. The density, microstructure and superconducting properties of the resulting ceramic are influenced significantly by the shockwaves generated from the dynamic processing and a comparison is made between the two compaction processes employed. Critical temperatures of 92 and 94 K were obtained for the explosively and electromagnetically compacted billets, respectively.

From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses, interlayer regions of about 10 nm thick with complicated mixing bonds were found at SiOCH/SiCN interfaces. With plasma treatments, especially H- 2 /NH 3 two-step plasma, a carbon-depletion region of about 30 non thick with more Si-O related bonds of <b>high</b> binding <b>energy</b> <b>formed</b> at the interface. Furthermore, the adhesion strengths of the SiOCH/SiCN interfaces were measured by nanoscratch and microscratch tests. For the untreated interface, the adhesion energy was obtained as about 0. 22 and 0. 44 J/m(2) by nanoscratch and microscratch tests, respectively. After plasma treatments, especially the H- 2 /NH 3 treatment, the interfacial adhesion energy was effectively improved to 0. 41 and 0. 89 J/m(2) because more Si-O bonds of <b>high</b> binding <b>energy</b> <b>formed</b> at the interfaces.

40|$|The {{displacement}} of molecular structures from their thermodynamically most stable state by imposition {{of various types}} of electronic and conformational constraints generates highly strained entities that tend to release the accumulated strain energy by undergoing either structural changes or chemical reactions. The latter case amounts to strain-induced reactivity (SIR) that may enforce specific chemical transformations. A particular case concerns dynamic covalent chemistry which may present SIR, whereby reversible reactions are activated by coupling to a high-energy state. We herewith describe such a dynamic covalent chemical (DCC) system involving the reversible imine formation reaction. It {{is based on the}} formation of strained macrocyclic bis-imine metal complexes in which the macrocyclic ligand is in a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>form</b> enforced by the coordination of the metal cation. Subsequent demetallation generates a highly strained free macrocycle that releases its accumulated s train energy by hydrolysis and reassembly into a resting state. Specifically, the metal-templated condensation of a dialdehyde with a linear diamine leads to a bis-imine [1 + 1]-macrocyclic complex in which the macrocyclic ligand is in a coordination-enforced strained conformation. Removal of the metal cation by a competing ligand yields a highly reactive [1 + 1]-macrocycle, which then undergoes hydrolysis to transient non-cyclic aminoaldehyde species, which then recondense to a strain-free [2 + 2]-macrocyclic resting state. The process can be monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Energy differences between different conformational states have been evaluated by Hartree-Fock (HF) computations. One may note that the stabilisation of high-energy molecular forms by metal ion coordination followed by removal of the latter, offers a general procedure for producing out-of-equilibrium molecular states, the fate of which may then be examined, in particular when coupled to dynamic covalent chemical processes...|$|R
