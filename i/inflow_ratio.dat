40|$|Present work {{introduced}} the aerodynamics analysis of rotor blade helicopter in forward flight. The analysis used a combination between a Momentum Theory and The Blade Element Theory. Here the <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> was assumed a uniform over the disk plane {{and it was}} predicted by using the momentum Theory. As the <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> is available, then by using the Blade element theory, the aerodynamics loading along the blade span of the rotor are computed, which finally the thrust coefficient CT can be obtained. For a given a rotor blade configuration and flight condition, the Thrust coefficient CT is unknown, while the momentum theory required this value to be known in predicting the <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio.</b> As result an iteration process is required in implementing those two combined approaches. For the assessment purposes, four test cases had been studied. The difference between one case to other case had been selected in term: 1) twist distribution, 2) the presence of coning angle and 3) the required aerodynamics characteristics. The result showed {{that the combination of}} Momentum Theory and The blade element theory could provide a fast solution in predicting the aerodynamics performance of rotor blade helicopter. However a comparison result with the experiment result was required in order to asses the degree of accuracy of this approach. This was suggested as future work. ...|$|E

40|$|The average {{household}} income of first generation immigrants in Europe and North-America {{is lower than}} that of natives, and this difference can not be explained by their amount of human capital (education, age, gender, residence). This is above all true for immigrants, coming from the second- or third world, who have also a lower return of their education. These arrears in income of immigrants vary between countries of destination, also after control for the individual characteristics of immigrants and natives. Only one characteristic of immigration policy has a significant effect on the variance of income arrears of immigrants across the countries of destination: the <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> of asylum seekers. The higher this <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> of asylum seekers in a country of destination, the larger the income differences between comparable immigrants and natives in that country of destination. Also only one characteristic of the labour market for foreigners has a significant effect on income arrears of immigrants in various countries of destination and from different countries of origin. A larger labour market participation by foreigners increases their income arrear with comparable natives, but this larger labour market participation by decreases that income arrear of the higher educated immigrant and does that extra for the higher educated immigrant from the second and third world. ...|$|E

This model loosely couples a Generalized Dynamic Wake Theory (GDWT) to a thin-layer Navier-Stokes solution procedure. This coupling is achieved using an unsteady pressure jump boundary condition in the Navier-Stokes model. The new unsteady pressure jump boundary condition models each rotor blade as a moving pressure jump which travels around the rotor azimuth and is applied between two adjacent planes in a cylindrical, non-rotating grid.

30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{reservoir}} capacity to inflow indirectly provides {{an index of}} residence time of sediment laden water in the reservoir (Reddy 2005). Most sediment enters reservoirs during high inflow periods and ideally if the capacity–inflow ratio is small, much {{of it will be}} discharged over the spillway (Reddy 2005). If the capacity–inflow ratio is large, much of this water is retained in the reservoir resulting in high sediment trap efficiency (Reddy 2005). The capacity–inflow ratio for the dam was 0.8 which is higher than the recommended ratio of 0.3 for long economic life of the dam. In highly degraded catchments, where large sediment yield is expected, the capacity to <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> of about 0.5 is mostly recommended (Wallingford 2004). With such a high capacity–inflow ratio for the dam, the reservoir is expected to have high siltation and shorter economic life.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of IABP on LV diastolic dysfunction using standard TEE derived parameters. Intraoperative TEE was performed in 10 patients (mean age 65 ± 11 yrs) undergoing urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), who had received an IABP preoperatively. TEE derived measures of diastolic dysfunction included early to late transmitral Doppler <b>inflow</b> velocity <b>ratio</b> (E/A), deceleration time (Dt), pulmonary venous systolic to diastolic Doppler velocity ratio (S/D), transmitral propagation velocity (Vp), and the ratio of early to late mitral annular tissue Doppler velocities (e'/a'). Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test, and a p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Transmitral <b>inflow</b> E/A <b>ratios</b> increased significantly from 0. 86 to 1. 07 (p < 0. 05), while Dt decreased significantly from 218 to 180 ms (p < 0. 05) with the use of IABP. Significant increases in Vp (34 cm/s to 43 cm/s; p < 0. 05), and e'/a' (0. 58 to 0. 71; p < 0. 05) suggested a favourable influence of intraaortic counterpulsation on diastolic function.

Averaged model scale data were compared with averaged full scale, inflight acoustic data under similar nondimensional test conditions. At low advance ratios (mu = 0. 164 to 0. 194), the data scale remarkable well in level and waveform shape, and also duplicate the directivity pattern of BVI impulsive noise. At moderate advance ratios (mu = 0. 224 to 0. 270), the scalig deteriorates, suggesting that the model scale rotor is not adequately simulating the full scale BVI noise; presently, no proved explanation of this discrepancy exists.

Increased evaporation of lake water at Nam Co is recorded by the n-alkanes of aquatic origin. Hence, isotopic enrichment results in a difference between terrestrial and aquatic n-alkanes in the opposite direction (!" 68 ‰) from that known for humid climate conditions (!+ 30 ‰) predominating at Holzmaar. Based on this isotopic difference between terrestrial and aquatic n-alkanes, evap-oration to <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> (E/I) values were estimated and suggest that the isotopic difference is indicative of the general hydroclimatic characteristics of a lake system. Moreover, the comparison with E/I values calculated with actual stable water isotope data showed that the dD values of aquatic and terrestrial lacustrine n-alkanes serve as a proxy for the relative isotopic differences between lake and inflow waters and can be used to assess the proportion of water undergoing evapo-ration relative to the inflow, and thus to reconstruct the lake water balance in the past. ! 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 1...|$|E

Siltation life of the reservoir was determined from rate of incoming sediment, trap efficiency and reservoir capacity using the Wallingford method. The average rainfall of the study area was about 560  mm while runoff from the catchment ranged from 0.3  mm (minimum) to 199  mm (maximum) with an overall average runoff of 50.03  mm. Results showed that the overall mean annual sediment concentration was approximately 2, 400  ppm. The reservoir capacity to <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> was estimated at 0.8 with a sedimentation rate of 120.1  tkm− 2  year− 1. Calculated probability of the dam filling is 26.8  %.

The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed progressive decline (p <  0.05) of the vegetation health from 2000 to 2009. While acknowledging the limitations of techniques used, this study demonstrates in part the effectiveness of sedimentation modelling and remote sensing as a tool for the production of baseline data for assessment and monitoring levels of land degradation in the Malilangwe reservoir catchment.|$|E

The jet is modeled as an inhomogeneous boundary condition at the crossflow wall. We find two fundamental frequencies, pertaining to self-sustained oscillations in the flow, using full nonlinear direct numerical simulation (DNS) {{as well as a}} modal decomposition into global linear eigenmodes and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes; a high frequency which is characteristic for the shear-layer vortices and the upright vortices in the jet wake, and a low frequency which is dominant in the region downstream of the jet orifice. Both frequencies can be related to a region of reversed flow downstream of the jet orifice. This region is observed to oscillate predominantly in the wall-normal direction with the high frequency, and in the spanwise direction with the low frequency. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the governing Navier–Stokes equations clearly shows the horseshoe vortices and the corresponding wall vortices further downstream, and the emergence of a distinct counter-rotating vortex pair high in the free stream. It is thus found that neither the inclusion of the jet pipe nor unsteadiness is necessary to generate the characteristic counter-rotating vortex pair...|$|E

Patients completed the SF- 36 questionnaire. Results: There were no strong and significant associations between echocardiographic measures and HRQoL in NYHA I-II class patients. In NYHA III class in univariate linear regression analyses significant associations were found between LVEF and physical functioning (b = 0. 230, P = 0. 009) and role limitations due to physical problems (b = 0. 230, P = 0. 009) and these associations remain significant after adjustment for age, gender, hypertension, angina pectoris class, nitrate, ACE inhibitors and diuretics use.

The experimental measurements showed that as the advance ratio (m) increased, the induced upflow region moved progressively from the forward 20 percent of the rotor disc at m = 0. 15 to covering most of the forward half of the rotor disc at m = 0. 30. The induced inflow characteristics at all advance ratios were found to be unsymmetrical about the longitudinal centerline. The maximum downwash was found to be in the rear portion of the disc and skewed toward the advancing blade side.

The control design {{is based upon}} a full, 6 -DoF, analytic nonlinear dynamic model, which is manipulated into a pseudo-linear form in which system matrices are given explicitly {{as a function of}} the current state. A standard Riccati equation is then solved numerically in each frame of a 50 Hz. control loop to design the state feedback control law on-line. Several flights have been flown with the helicopter to evaluate the accuracy of tracking under SDRE control in comparison with simulation results.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on lactate production by adipocytes, healthy volunteers were studied during three experimental protocols. In protocol 1, the changes in interstitial lactate concentrations were measured by microdialysis (sc tissue) after oral glucose administration. The plasma lactate concentration increased by 39. 4 +/- 6. 0 %, and the dialysate lactate concentration increased by 117. 9 +/- 16. 3 %. In protocol 2, a 2. 5 -h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and somatostatin infusion were performed. The plasma and dialysate lactate concentrations increased by 27. 1 +/- 5. 5 % and 146. 8 +/- 44. 5 %, respectively. In addition, [U- 13 C]glucose was infused through the probe, and dialysate lactate was enriched in 13 C at 2. 5 +/- 0. 3 molar percent excess basally and at 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 molar percent excess during the clamp (P < 0. 05 vs. basal). [13 C]Urea was also infused through the probe, and the outflow to <b>inflow</b> <b>ratio</b> of [13 C]urea was used as an index of local blood flow. It decreased by 10. 2 +/- 3. 6 % (P < 0. 001) {{at the end of the}} hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, indicating an increase in blood flow. In protocol 3, a hyperglycemic clamp (10. 0 mmol/L) at the basal insulin concentration was performed. It increased the dialysate lactate concentration by 43. 5 +/- 15. 9 % and did not alter the plasma lactate concentration or local blood flow. It is concluded that hyperinsulinemia and, to a lesser extent, hyperglycemia stimulate glucose conversion into lactate in adipocytes. Hyperinsulinemia, but not hyperglycemia, also increases adipose tissue blood flow...|$|E
40|$|Jet-like {{flows in}} sudden channel {{expansions}} with horizontal or sloping bottoms are investigated. These flows occur at inflows to lakes and reservoirs or at wastewater discharge sites. An integral analysis {{approach has been}} used. The main objective of the study has been to develop a method by which the dilution of inflows to lakes or reservoirs can be predicted if t. he geometry (simplified) and inflow conditions are known. If the. diffuser angle, the sloping angle of the bottom <b>inflow</b> channel aspect <b>ratio</b> and <b>inflow</b> densimetric Froude number are given, the equations which will be presented {{can be used to}} estimate the dilution of plunging or non-plunging inflows. This information is needed in one-dimensional water quality models of stratified lakes or reservoirs. The integral jet flow analysis used herein includes a similarity hypothesis for velocity profiles, application of the entrainment principle and consideration of bottom friction effects on momentum. A general theoretical model is developed to predict jet centerline velocity, width and dilution of non-buoyant turbulent jet flows over horizontal or sloping bottoms in abruptly expanding channels. Wall effects in gradually expanding channels are also investigated for half jets. Predictions obtained with the theoretical model are compared with some experimental data of jet dimensions and dilution. The model is applied to geometrically simplified field conditions to illustrate effects of <b>inflow</b> channel aspect <b>ratio,</b> friction and bottom slope. All of these effects are found to be significant. As a side product a Gauss fitting method has been developed to analyze a finite number of laboratory measurements in horizontal diffuser flows with finite water depth. In an Appendix purely empirical equations for the dilution of horizontal jet-like flows through diffusers are also developed. Experimental results of density induced plunging flows into reservoirs (negatively buoyant) and of non-buoyant jet flows have been used...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a scheme for optimal placement of outdoor condensing unit. To this end, we examine the relationship between rise in suction temperature and the placement of outdoor condensing unit in multi-level installations. A model experiment is performed for outdoor condensing. In addition, an equation for predicting rise in suction temperature for outdoor unit having an outside-air <b>inflow</b> rate R_m (<b>ratio</b> of outside-air <b>inflow</b> volume to air volume of the outdoor unit) is used to clarify the relationship between the rise in suction temperature of outdoor unit and equipment setup conditions. Based on these results, factors that will determine setup conditions considering the rise in suction temperature of outdoor unit are found and a method for suppressing rise in suction temperature is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{theoretical}} arguments tell us {{that countries}} with relatively little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows in and speeds up the process of income convergence. We show in a calibrated neoclassical model that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for developing countries. The welfare gain from switching from financial autarky to perfect capital mobility is roughly equivalent to a 1 percent permanent increase in domestic consumption for the typical non-OECD country. This is negligible relative to the welfare gain from a take-off in domestic productivity of the magnitude observed {{in some of these}} countries.
