25|$|Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987, all {{territorial}} sea and land of New Zealand is declared a nuclear free zone. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships {{are prohibited from}} entering the country's territorial waters. Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons {{in the country is}} outlawed. Despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal, nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> radioactive medical treatments produced in overseas reactors illegal. A 2008 survey shows that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source.|$|E

She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans?

500|$|The Honda {{executives}} were intrigued, but demanded a cut using actual automotive parts before giving {{permission to go}} ahead with the full-scale project. [...] "Cog" [...] was approved with a budget of £1million, and Gooden & Walker recruited a London-based team to go through the logistics of the shoot in detail. The team, which comprised engineers, special effects technicians, car designers, and even a sculptor, spent a month working with parts from a disassembled Honda Accord before the design for the advertisement's set was even finalised. Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific [...] Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures. Antoine Bardou-Jacquet was hired to direct the piece. Bardou-Jacquet was mostly known for directing several award-winning music videos, including Alex Gopher's [...] "The Child", Playgroup's [...] "Number One", and Air's [...] "How <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Make</b> You Feel".|$|E
500|$|Breyer wrote separately, {{concerned}} that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: [...] "But what sense <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with {{an image of a}} nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?" [...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E
