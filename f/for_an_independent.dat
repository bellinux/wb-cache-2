5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{said that}} {{from then on}} the British did {{everything}} they could to break up the Umma party and to thwart him personally.

He hoped <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen.

5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received no offers. Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919, but {{resigned}} in 1925 {{when he felt}} that the party was only serving the interests of the Brahmins. He questioned the subjugation of Dravidians as the Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from them but opposed and discriminated them in cultural and religious matters. In 1924, E.V. Ramasamy participated in a non-violent agitation (satyagraha) in Vaikam, Kerala. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy toured British Malaya, Europe, and Russia, which had an influence on him. In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party, and in 1944, he changed its name to Dravidar Kazhagam. The party later split and one group led by C. N. Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).|$|E
5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>Independent</b> Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set for Medicare were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.|$|E

5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the months}} and years that followed, {{commentators}} questioned the accuracy of France2's report. The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France2's news editor said in 2005 {{that no one could}} be sure who fired the shots. Other commentators, particularly Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> international investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scleractinians {{were not}} reef builders, but were small, phaceloid or solitary individuals. Scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest {{diversity in the}} Jurassic and all but disappeared in the mass extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous, about 18 out of 67 genera surviving. Recently discovered Paleozoic corals with aragonitic skeletons and cyclic septal insertion – two features that characterize Scleractinia – have strengthened the hypothesis <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> origin of the Scleractinia. Whether the early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question. The phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during the Tertiary, and the genera Astrangia, Madracis, Cladocora and Oculina, all in different families, each have both zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate members.|$|E
