50|$|Direct-attached storage, or DAS, are {{storage units}} {{that can be}} added to a NAS {{solution}} via <b>Daisy-Chaining</b> technology to increase the NAS' storage volume. A maximum of 4 DAS units can be added.|$|R
5000|$|Conserver is {{generally}} used in computer cluster setups too, logging messages either via a terminal server [...] or with an instance running on every node monitoring the console {{of the next}} machine, known as <b>daisy-chaining.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dependence {{upon all}} {{other aspects of}} XP: [...] "XP is like a ring of {{poisonous}} snakes, <b>daisy-chained</b> together. All it takes is {{for one of them}} to wriggle loose, and you've got a very angry, poisonous snake heading your way." ...|$|E
50|$|AMD's {{answer to}} this is the G3MX chip. This {{is very similar to}} the AMB, but is {{intended}} to be placed on the motherboard, not on the DIMM. It can connect to multiple DIMMs but, to minimize latency, is not designed to be <b>daisy-chained.</b>|$|E
50|$|Multiple tuners {{may also}} be fed from an SCR or Unicable LNB in a single cable {{distribution}} system. A Unicable LNB has one output connector but operates {{in a different way}} to standard LNBs so it can feed multiple tuners <b>daisy-chained</b> along a single coax cable.|$|E
5000|$|The obvious {{solution}} {{is to use a}} narrower, higher-speed bus to interface to memory, and to implement it as a point-to-point link, <b>daisy-chaining</b> additional modules. However, Intel have made two attempts at this, neither hugely successful: ...|$|R

5000|$|RDRAM {{implements}} the bus on a DRAM chip. However, {{the high-speed}} circuitry increased power consumption, and the <b>daisy-chaining</b> caused significantly higher memory latency. Because {{it is difficult}} to implement high-speed circuitry on the same semiconductor process, costs were high.|$|R
50|$|Acorn's Machine Operating System (MOS) or OS is a {{discontinued}} computer {{operating system}} {{used in the}} Acorn BBC computer range. It included support for four-channel sound and graphics, file system abstraction, and digital and analogue I/O including a <b>daisy-chained</b> expansion bus. The implementation was single-tasking, monolithic and non-reentrant.|$|E
50|$|ADB {{was created}} by Steve Wozniak, who {{had been looking for}} a project to work on in the mid-1980s.

50|$|KVM {{switches}} {{differ in}} the number of computers that can be connected. Traditional switching configurations range from 2 to 64 possible computers attached to a single device.
