5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v.

The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, {{though some of the}} amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, I {{wrote an article}} {{entitled}} The <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> Traditional <b>Marriage.</b> 1 I began with the topic <b>of</b> same-sex <b>marriage</b> but soon saw that all the arguments for gay marriage were also arguments for polygamy, endogamy (or incestuous marriage), etc., so the article became a <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>marriage</b> against all these other types. The pertinent law and jurisprudence are constantly changing, so this conference offers an excellent opportunity to reconsider my views in light of new learning and thinking. A review shows the case for traditional marriage is even stronger {{now than it was}} before. As evidence has mounted and the glib arguments for same-sex marriage have drawn closer scrutiny, support for traditional marriage has expanded from its initial base, which was heavily concentrated in religious conservatives, by attracting growing numbers of religious and political moderates and liberals...|$|R

The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set performance goals for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the <b>Defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marriage</b> Act.|$|E

25|$|Kossuth's arrests caused great indignation. The Diet, which reconvened in 1839, {{demanded the}} release of the prisoners, and refused to pass any {{government}} measures. Austrian prime minister Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way. While Wesselényi had been broken by his imprisonment, Kossuth, partly supported by the frequent visits of Terézia Meszlényi, emerged from prison in better conditions. Immediately after his release, Kossuth and Meszlényi were married, and she remained a firm supporter of his politics. Although Meszlényi was a Catholic, Roman Catholic priests refused to bless the marriage, as Kossuth, a Protestant, would not convert. This experience influenced Kossuth's firm <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> mixed <b>marriages.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} abolitionist {{support for}} interracial marriage.

Many abolitionists stated they personally did not recommend interracial marriage at present due to the backlash couples would face, while also denying that it was unnatural or immoral.

50|$|Metepa {{was married}} Christian and a {{policeman}} {{who worked for}} the Japanese; he lusted after a Protestant's wife named Ia Mentil.

To Rot met Kueka who ordered that he cease his pastoral activities while meanwhile Metepa and another seized Mentil and beat up her husband.

This event served to augment To Rot's <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>marriage</b> with spies monitoring him to catch him in the act of piousness so as to arrest him.

40|$|Mormon {{culture has}} {{produced}} during its history an unusual number of historically valuable personal writings. Few such diaries, journals, and memoirs published have provided as rich and well rounded {{a window into}} their authors 2 ̆ 7 lives and worlds as the diary of Helen Mar Kimball Whitney. Because it provides a rare account of the widely experienced situations and problems faced by widows, her record has relevance far beyond Mormon history though. As a teenager Helen Kimball had been a polygamous wife of Mormon founder Joseph Smith. She subsequently married Horace Whitney. Her children included the noted Mormon author, religious authority, and politician Orson F. Whitney. She herself was a leading woman in her church and society and a writer known especially for her <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> plural <b>marriage.</b> Upon Horace 2 ̆ 7 s death, she began keeping a diary. In it, she recorded her economic, physical, and psychological struggles {{to meet the challenges}} of widowhood. Her writing was introspective and revelatory. She also commented on the changing society around her, as Salt Lake City in the last decades of the nineteenth century underwent rapid transformation, modernizing and opening up from its pioneer beginnings. She remained a well-connected member of an elite group of leading Latter-day Saint women, and prominent Utah and Mormon historical figures appear frequently in her daily entries. Above all, though, her diary is an unusual record of difficulties faced in many times and places by women, of all classes, whose husbands died and left them without sufficient means to carry on the types of lives to which they had been accustomed.
