50|$|Due to {{the mass}} {{unemployment}} {{in the recent years}} it came to a <b>de-skilling</b> of human capital, in particular at the long-term unemployed. As a result, a lack of professional workers and executives is conceivable. It can be assumed that these developments in the future will continue. Especially the globalization with the opening of world markets and ever-accelerating technological innovations increasingly require qualified personnel, which means for most employers only a good investment if it can be obligate to the company in the long run. Therefore, it is extremely important for companies, being an attractive employer in order to hire the decreasing number of young specialists and executives and obligate them to the company.|$|E

50|$|Digitization is {{currently}} causing many changes to traditional journalistic practice. The labour of journalists {{in general is}} becoming increasingly dependant on digital journalism. Scholars outline that {{this is actually a}} change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the labour process.. They also contend that this is simply the <b>de-skilling</b> of some skills and the up-skilling of others. This theory is in contention to the notion that technological determinism is negatively effecting journalism, as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set. Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being outsourcing, algorithms, and automation. Although she believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.|$|E
30|$|Undoubtedly, the {{application}} of information technology has caused the <b>de-skilling</b> trend {{to move up the}} occupational ladder. <b>De-skilling</b> is not just a feature of industrial workers but of knowledge workers as well. For most editors, the introduction of media digitalization has largely removed them from the conception stage of production. In most Chinese publishing houses, editors are mainly responsible for checking typos on the screen and reading drafts to ensure their political correctness. There is a growing awareness among editors that new technology has devalued much of their professional knowledge and the abilities upon which they had once prided themselves (Liu 2006). Such professional knowledge and abilities for editors include having a solid background of grammar and sentence rules, accurate understanding of the logic of language, and the ability to connect book contents to readers’ interests.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, in recent years, as {{technological}} development has advanced, editors have experienced numerous challenges {{resulting from the}} dramatic changes in both their work process and their working conditions.

40|$|In skill-biased (<b>de-skilling)</b> {{technological}} revolutions learning investments {{required by}} new machines are greater (smaller) than those required by preexisting machines. Skill-biased (<b>de-skilling)</b> revolutions trigger reallocations of capital from slow- (fast-) to fast- (slow-) learning workers, {{thereby reducing the}} relative and absolute wages of the former. The model of skill-biased (<b>de-skilling)</b> revolutions provides insight into developments since the mid- 1970 ’s (in the 1910 ’s). The empirical work documents a large increase in the interindustry dispersion of capital-labor ratios since 1975. Changes in industry capital intensity {{are related to the}} skill composition of the labor force. (JEL E 23 J 31 O 33) Income and wage inequality is rising in the United States, as well as in several other countries. Started in the 1970 ’s, this large increase in earnings dispersion results from both absolute gains at the top, and absolute losses at the bottom, of the wage distribution. In fact, even median real earnings have declined. Various empirical explanations have been proposed for these trends, and {{the jury is still out}} on the quantitative importance of the different hypotheses. However, a growing consensus attributes a significant role to skill-biased technical change. The Information-Technology Revolution is the obvious suspect. 1 Despite the intensity of the empirical debate, theoretical work on skill-biased technological change has—with few exceptions—lagged behind. In this paper I present a simple model of technological revolutions. I explore the interaction between skills and technology, and offer an interpretation for the changing nature of this interaction. In doing so, I propose an expla...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a {{rich set of}} microeconomic {{labour market}} data [...] the 1988 ­ 90 Labour Market Activity Survey {{published}} by Statistics Canada [...] to test whether there is negative duration dependence in unemployment spells. It updates and extends similar work carried out by Jones (1995) who used the 1986 ­ 87 Labour Market Activity Survey. Applying hazard model estimation, the analysis finds some evidence of negative duration dependence at the microeconomic level, {{which is consistent with}} the <b>de-skilling</b> hypothesis of hysteresis. These microeconomic estimates of negative duration dependence are used to compute macroeconomic estimates of hysteresis in unemployment. The results suggest that hysteresis effects from <b>de-skilling</b> are very small at the macro level, contributing less than 0. 1 percentage points to the aggregate unemployment rate. The small estimated size of this hysteresis effect may explain why evidence of hysteresis has been so difficult to find at the macroeconomic level. The paper also shows that Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits reduce the probability of exiting from unemployment and that unemployment duration {{does not seem to be}} prolonged by reservation-wage effects.

40|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} (EBM) {{is strongly}} shaping {{the nature and}} direction of biomedical practice and organisational culture. Clinicians are now expected to adopt the principles of EBM and evidence-based practice (EBP) whilst also maintaining such things as professional autonomy, clinical judgement and therapeutic integrity. Little sociological {{work has been done}} on the implications of EBM in oncology contexts. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 13 oncology consultants and 12 oncology nurses in Australia, in this paper we explore how oncology clinicians utilise and/or critique types of evidence and statistical probabilities; the organisational systematisation of care; and, wider policies of EBM. The results illustrate significant variation in perception of EBM between the oncology sub-specialties examined, and the central role of organisational structures and intra-professional hierarchies in how evidence is viewed and utilised in practice. The interviews also capture the ways in which oncology specialists are negotiating the systematisation of care under the rubric of EBM, and the contradictory effects of professional <b>de-skilling</b> vis-à-vis the reinforcement of biomedical objectivity/power. Finally, we examine the experiences and perceptions of oncology nurses in relation to evidence and EBM, exploring the interplay of processes of professionalisation and distinction in shaping the evidence-based trajectories of nursing. We contrast these results with previous sociological writings on EBM, reflecting on the applicability and limitations of these theoretical positions when applied to the experiences of oncology clinicians.

30|$|The {{concept of}} labor process was first {{mentioned}} by Karl Marx in Das Kapital {{but it was}} only a century later that Braverman developed the labor process theory. Once Labor and Monopoly Capital was published in 1974, its influence was universal and interdisciplinary. The theory ties together the unequal strength of work and political economics, capital expansion and the capitalist workplace. Discussion of the labor process influenced many disciplines. Research was concentrated on the aspects of management control, <b>de-skilling</b> and deregulation. It was also criticized for separating workplace conflict from monopolistic capitalism, large companies, the labor market and the government (Smith, 2015).|$|E
30|$|<b>De-skilling</b> insinuates that a {{sport is}} made easier to {{undertake}} {{as a result}} of the introduction of a technology or product (Sheridan 2006). For example, the sport of aeromodelling has suggested that performance enhancements made to the planes design and controls would reduce the technical skill required to fly the planes and perform complex manoeuvres (Norris 2011). Likewise, innovations such as depth finders, bait casting reels and sonar, has increased anglings popularity but deskilled the requirement of fish detection and landing. This ultimately required the introduction of ‘technologically-designed handicaps’ by the sport’s governing body to ensure fair play (Hummel and Foster 1986).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{some problems}} in the articulation of a national skill formation strategy seeking to sustain ‘the drive to maturity’ of the Pakistan economy. We examine the thought of two economists—Adam Smith and Amartya Sen—to identify market-, society-, and state-related skills that they theorise as necessary for sustaining an economy’s ‘drive to maturity’. We then briefly outline Michel Foucault’s social theory to contextualise these skill formation paradigms within the institutional structure characteristic of mature capitalism. We argue that integration within global capitalist order leaves little room for the articulation of such a skill formation national strategy. Pakistan is therefore likely to share {{the fate of the}} majority of the under-developed countries which are experiencing <b>de-skilling</b> and detechonolgising...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{problem is that}} there is ongoing and heated debate about the usefulness of state mandated assessment instruments launched by NCLB (No Child Left Behind, 2004) for reforming public school edu-cational academic practices. Proponents of measure-ment-driven reform have argued that “if you test it, they will teach it ” and that assessment drives the edu-cational system to be more productive and effective (Popham, 1987). A rationale to research the effective-ness of a state mandated test is based on opponents of measurement-driven reform asserting that high-stakes testing and assessment creates negative side effects such as dumbing-down the curriculum, <b>de-skilling</b> teachers, pushing students out of school, and gener-ally inciting fear and anxiety among both students an...|$|E
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{agreement}} {{that teachers are}} central to curriculum planning and development as it is teachers who ultimately decide whether or not, or to what extent, to implement innovations.

Also examined are teachers’ views on the consequent subject content and the management of the subject in schools, in an attempt to identify factors that aided or hindered teachers from supporting and delivering HGPE. It is suggested that as a consequence of teachers being expected to deliver an externally prescribed curriculum, de-professionalisation and <b>de-skilling</b> are probable teacher experiences...|$|E
40|$|The {{delivery}} {{of health care}} {{is in the process}} of “industrialization” in that it is undergoing changes in the organization of work which mirror those that began in other industries a century ago. This process is characterized by an increasing division of labor, standardization of roles and tasks, the rise of a managerial superstructure, and the degradation (or <b>de-skilling)</b> of work. The consolidation of the health care industry, the fragmentation of physician roles, and the increasing numbers of nonphysician clinicians will likely accelerate this process. Although these changes hold the promise of more efficient and effective health care, physicians should be concerned about the resultant loss of autonomy, disruption of continuity of care, and the potential erosion of professional values...|$|E
40|$|A {{key feature}} of current school-sector reform in England is the {{restructuring}} of teachers' work and {{the increased use of}} support staff to undertake a range of activities previously undertaken by teachers. Supporters speak of a new teacher professionalism focused on the "core task" of teaching. Critics fear deprofessionalization through a process of <b>de-skilling,</b> work intensification, and labor substitution. This article uses labor process theory and empirical data to analyze recent developments in teachers' work and links these to the different ways in which teacher trade unions have bargained over reform. The article argues that workforce reform cannot be analyzed separately from the trade union strategies that seek to influence policy and that the emergence of a type of "reform unionism" in England represents the integration of product and process in polic...|$|E

In this context, the approach to the divestment concept without an social and económical context, does not show a group of associated practices and representations.

This type of strategy is designated by "divestment". The social level of consequencies are not due to the closing down or de-localization of production units that are divesting, but can be materialised of efects that are irreversible. This means unemployment, <b>de-skilling,</b> labour precarization and even emergence of new forms of social exclusion in former industrialised regions. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{golf ball}} also saw {{complaints}} and controversy when it moved {{from its original}} gutta percha construction to the more modern rubber core (Vamplew 2007). The newer ball design was able to achieve greater travelling distance, therefore requiring fewer strokes to cover the course. The complaints for the new balls adoption originated from the players themselves who had become skilled in its use (Vamplew 2007). This was a case whereby a governing body formally adopted some level of <b>de-skilling</b> to the game it regulated. Conversely, the attempted introduction of the ‘Polara’ golf ball decades later comprised an optimised dimple pattern on its surface which reduced the balls tendency to hook or slice (Dyer et al. 2011).

40|$|Proposing an {{explanation}} of current macro-sociological changes and institutional transformations in journalism, this article argues that journalism is currently undergoing a process of mediatization. Drawing upon the international research literature as well as statements from interviews with news workers working on Danish news websites, the article examines four current trends in journalism that are closely connected {{to the rise of}} news on the web, namely the use of the affordances of news websites, radical commercialization, increased audience participation in news production, and the increased multi-skilling and simultaneous <b>de-skilling</b> of journalists. Taken together, these trends reflect a process through which journalism increasingly subsumes itself to the logic of the media, suggesting mediatization as an adequate explanatory framework. One implication of such a process is that journalism seems to be transforming from an occupational profession into an organizational one. </p...|$|E

Also, the university setting of nurse education is seen as clinically <b>de-skilling</b> both nurse teachers and student nurses as well as influencing the discourses on clinical skills. The paper further argues {{that the effects of}} such trends are a captive market in nurse education contracting and a displacement of nursing knowledge. An approach to commissioning nurse education is described which may counter such trends and positively impact on NHS organizational development and quality. Further reform of the commissioning process is described in context of pragmatic health legislation...|$|E

To help us understand fine art education now, this paper proposes six curricula that have been successively introduced since the start of formal art education: apprenticeship; traditional; formalist; romantic; conceptual; professional. The present-day curriculum is explained in terms of <b>de-skilling</b> and a continued belief in romantic notions of art for art's sake. These are often implicit and form a hidden curriculum that has a considerable impact on teaching and assessment. These romantic notions need to be better understood and challenged. Moreover, the curriculum is now both too full and too narrow. A solution to this might be found if it were presumed that the curriculum is for learning about art, rather than learning to be artists...|$|E
