40|$|While the law {{relating}} {{to the use of}} extrinsic materials, such as second reading speeches and <b>explanatory</b> <b>memoranda,</b> in statutory interpretation appears to be reasonably settled, nonetheless, both the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation have sought to rely on extrinsic material to support a particular interpretation of legislation. The ability to use extrinsic material an have significant implications for the taxpayer or the Commissioner. It is therefore important to understand when it is appropriate to use this material. Significant costs can be incurred by a taxpayer in basing an argument on extrinsic material, only to discover that the courts will not consider such material. This article reviews recent cases to determine to what extent these rules continue to apply and how and when tax practitioners can rely on extrinsic material to support a stance taken against the Commissioner or allow a practitioner to dispute the Commissioner’s use of such material...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands {{is among}} the first {{countries}} that have put specific net neutrality standards in place. The decision to implement specific regulation was influenced by at least three factors. The first was the prevailing social and academic debate, partly due to developments in the United States. The second was {{the implementation of the}} amended European regulatory framework for the communication sector. Concrete developments in the Dutch market were the third factor. The first part of this chapter describes the three factor are described in detail. It sketches the context of the debate including the amendments that were introduced to regulate net neutrality. Specific incidents contributed to the willingness to change the telecommunications act. Next the relevant provisions are mentioned including the <b>explanatory</b> <b>memoranda,</b> as they offer the necessary background for the interpretation of the provisions. Three provisions are relevant: the core article on net neutrality and two supporting provisions on transparency and deep packet inspection. The new rules have to be implemented and supervised by the ACM (the Authority for Consumers and Markets), who had to deal with some first cases. Next to the role the regulator, the market was faced with the consequences of the regulation and changed its pricing policies. We also mention the fact that the rules were more or less extended into the framework of broadcasting regulation. The analysis and conclusions promote an integral value chain approach. It’s not possible to restrict net neutrality to ‘network neutrality’ exclusively. Other value chain elements need to be considered as well. it should be established which elements of the value chain affect the process of free exchange between the information provider and the information user. This is a matter far more complex than would be in line with a typical telecommunications approach where the accent is mainly on the provider of telecommunications networks and telecommunications services. The convergence between telecommunications and communications regulation can’t be ignored. At the same time, overregulation and underregulation will mean that any problems concerning throttling and blocking of Internet traffic will occur or be aggravated elsewhere in the value chain. The intended purpose will then not be achieved. Real net neutrality issues will arise {{in the context of the}} distribution of audio-visual services. It is expected that questions on interconnectivity (including the role of so called Content Distribution Networks (CDN’s) will get a more prominent place in the debate. Concepts such as ‘managed’ versus ‘unmanaged’ services need to be clarified and implemented in practice...|$|R
60|$|FOURTH. In {{the present}} edition all the Notes and <b>Memoranda,</b> <b>explanatory</b> of the Poems, which Wordsworth {{dictated}} to Miss Fenwick, {{are given in}} full. Miss Fenwick lived much at Rydal Mount, during the later years of the Poet's life; {{and it is to}} their friendship, and to her inducing Wordsworth to dictate these Notes, that we owe most of the information we possess, as to the occasions and circumstances under which his poems were composed. These notes were first made use of--although only in a fragmentary manner--by the late Bishop of Lincoln, in the 'Memoirs' of his uncle. They were afterwards incorporated in full in the edition of 1857, issued by Mr. Moxon, under the direction of Mr. Carter; and in the centenary edition. They were subsequently printed in 'The Prose Works of Wordsworth', edited by Dr. Grosart; and in my edition of 1882-6. I am uncertain whether it was the original MS., written by Miss Fenwick, or the copy of it afterwards taken for Miss Quillinan, to which Dr. Grosart had access. The text of these Notes, as printed in the edition of 1857, is certainly (in very many cases) widely different from what is given in 'The Prose Works' of 1876. I have made many corrections--from the MS. which I have examined with care--of errors which exist in all previously printed copies of these Notes, including my own.|$|R
2500|$|On 17 August 1971, the United States {{requested}} {{that a second}} item, [...] "The representation of China in the United Nations" [...] {{be placed on the}} provisional agenda too. In the <b>explanatory</b> <b>memorandum</b> accompanying the U.S. request, the U.S. said that in dealing with the problem of the representation of China, the United Nations should take cognizance of the existence of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China; it should reflect that incontestable reality {{in the manner in which}} it made provision for China's representation. The United Nations, the U.S. submitted, should not be required to take a position on the respective conflicting claims of the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China pending a peaceful resolution of the matter as called for by the United Nations Charter. Thus, the U.S. added, the People's Republic of China should be represented and at the same time provision should be made to ensure that the Republic of China was not deprived of its representation.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 1971 {{the representatives}} of 22 UN members {{requested}} the UN Secretary-General to distribute, as an official Assembly document a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China dated 20 August 1971. In this statement, made {{in response to the}} U.S. letter of 17 August 1971 and its accompanying <b>explanatory</b> <b>memorandum,</b> the People's Republic of China declared that the U.S. proposal was a blatant exposure of the Nixon government's scheme of creating [...] "two Chinas" [...] in the United Nations. It added, there was only one China, the People's Republic of China. Taiwan, it added, was an inalienable part of Chinese territory and a province of China which had already been returned to the motherland after the Second World War. It went on to state that the U.S. was plotting to separate Taiwan from China and was wildly attempting to force members of the UN to submit to its will. The Chinese government declared that the Chinese people and government firmly opposed [...] "two Chinas", [...] "one China, one Taiwan" [...] or any similar arrangements, as well as the claim that [...] "the status of Taiwan remains to be determined". They declared they would have {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the UN in such scenarios.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 July 1971, 17 UN members, led by Albania, {{requested}} that {{a question of}} the [...] "Restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations" [...] be placed on the provisional agenda of the twenty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly. In an <b>explanatory</b> <b>memorandum</b> accompanying their request, the 17 UN members observed that for years they had protested against the hostile and discriminatory policy followed by several governments with regard to the lawful government of China, the sole genuine representative of the Chinese people. The existence of the People's Republic of China, they declared, was a reality which could not be changed to suit the myth of a so-called [...] "Republic of China" [...] fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory. In the view of the 17 UN members the unlawful authorities installed in the island of Taiwan claiming to represent China, remained there only because of the permanent presence of United States armed forces. No important international problems, they added, could be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. It was in the fundamental interests, they concluded, of the United Nations to restore promptly to the People's Republic of China its seat in the organization thus putting an end to a grave injustice and dangerous situation which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated. This meant the immediate expulsion of the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime from the seat which it unlawfully holds in the United Nations.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, though the {{constitution}} of the Republic of China promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of {{the constitution of}} 1925 did individually list the provinces of the Republic of China and Taiwan was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably de jure part of Japan {{as the result of the}} Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that [...] "the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the National Assembly, it cannot be altered." [...] However, in 1946, Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-Sen and the minister of the Executive Yuan of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that [...] "there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of Mongolia, and the second example would be the reclamation of Taiwan. Both would be examples of territory changes." [...] Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951 and the Treaty of Taipei of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the General Order No. 1 (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The <b>explanatory</b> <b>memorandum</b> to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's Denunciation of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is therefore unnecessary.|$|E
