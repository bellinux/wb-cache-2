In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on,</b> often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E

2500|$|VC {{formations}} continually refined their techniques. At the Battle of Ong Thanh in 1967 they sprung another ambush, inflicting heavy {{casualties on}} American troops. In this encounter the VC {{used a variety}} of methods to neutralize dreaded US firepower, including [...] "hugging" [...] or fighting close to US troops. They also moved rapidly parallel to the line of ambush, sliding along its length and thus presenting a harder target for American counter-attack. While US firepower caused significant losses for the VC throughout the conflict, these methods show a force that was learning, adapting, and growing more proficient on the battlefield. Time as always, still favored Communist forces. Sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam were always available, forbidden to US ground attack. Inevitably, the ARVN and Americans would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> The VC and NVA regrouped and returned.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> We have done our best, but he {{has made it clear}} he wants to go and I think it looks pretty final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E
2500|$|Patton first {{alluded to}} the fact that Mr. Bungle would {{probably}} not record any more albums in 2003, stating in an interview, [...] "I think it is over. The guys are spread {{all over the world and}} we don't talk to each other. I have not spoken to a couple of the guys since the last tour, years ago." [...] Patton reiterated this sentiment in another 2003 interview with Australian newspaper The Age. While no official break-up announcement ever materialized, a 2004 Rolling Stone interview confirmed Mr. Bungle had disbanded with Patton revealing, “We could have probably squeezed out a couple more records but the collective personality of this group became so dysfunctional, this band was poisoned by one person's petty jealousy and insecurity, and it led us to a slow, unnatural death. And I'm at peace with that, because I know I tried all I could.” When asked about a possible reunion, Mike Patton said, [...] "It could happen, but I won’t be singing. Some bridges have definitely been burned. It was a fun time and sometimes you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> I’ve got a lot on my plate now." [...] Trevor Dunn added on his website, [...] "Bungle is dead and I'm happy about it" [...] and that [...] "the members of Mr. Bungle will never work together as such again". Spruance, Heifetz, and McKinnon have been more optimistic regarding a possible reunion.|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
