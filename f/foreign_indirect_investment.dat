40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this article}} is to present an {{overview}} of the international environment, highlighting the differing levels, from local and national, to regional and international. The discussion focuses on the main identifying features of the business organization, including ownership and decision-making structures, as they adapt in differing geographical contexts. It is emphasized that the multinational enterprise (MNE), central to international business activities, covers a variety of organizations, large and small and the growing interactions between organizations, governmental and societal players are resulting in a broader view of the business organization in society. This argument looks at varying perspectives, often argued to be the defining characteristic of our times. The Government of Albania has adopted a comprehensive policy reform program to strengthen Albania's weak institutional and governance capacity. Naturally, at the end of this article we will have a complete vision of Albanian situation. We are going to illustrate the nature of globalization, highlighting trends in globalized production and market, by contrasting the key features of foreign direct investment, <b>foreign</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>investment</b> and other modes of international operations...|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} unravel the puzzle {{underlying}} China's and India's differing experiences in attracting two types of foreign investment: namely foreign direct investment ('FDI') and foreign venture capital investment ('FVCI'). Complementing the law and finance literature, we argue that foreign investors prefer the direct investment mode in China despite its poor governance environment because direct investment provides private means {{of control over the}} business, and China's institutional environment provides a more facilitating arena for FDI than India's. In contrast, India's legal infrastructure and related institutional settings prove to be better than China's in accommodating <b>foreign</b> portfolio (<b>indirect)</b> <b>investment</b> especially in the form of venture capital. The conclusion of this article has implications for the two countries' legal reform {{in the direction of the}} desired type of foreign investment.

The {{literature on the}} effect of the governance environment (such as the legal system) on investment, which had been relatively underdeveloped, has begun to draw more attention recently. Existing studies, however, have largely ignored {{the differences between the two}} modes of investment in terms of investor protection. Their finding that a poor governance environment deters foreign direct investment is mis-specified and fails to explain why countries with a poor governance environment attract relatively large amount of direct investment as opposed to portfolio investment. We introduce a framework that measures the level of rule-based governance environment in a capital receiving economy, with an especial attention to the information and enforcement mechanisms for investor protection facilitated by different governance environments. We argue that in countries with a weak rule-based governance environment, investors prefer direct <b>investment</b> to <b>indirect</b> (portfolio) <b>investment,</b> because the former can be better protected by private means.

40|$|The {{world of}} art has {{experienced}} a strong and rapid growth since the “Art Bubble” of the 1980 s. This growth has been translated by the democratization of various tools to invest in art and the appeal to generate more revenues thanks to alternative investments. Consequently the art market became more volatile, leading to numerous speculative investments especially between the years 2004 and 2007. Moreover, because the art market {{is known to be}} highly opaque and illiquid, one would argue that investing in art could be risky. Therefore, because of the present opacity on the art market, the purpose of this Bachelor thesis is to present art as a particular object of investment and to enlighten the different methods of investing in art. Assessing the different rates of returns by either direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>investment</b> as well as appraising the overall risks that investors could be confronted to, this paper will guide us to final recommendations that are devoted to the mitigation of the latters. Hence, this Bachelor thesis shall be read and used as a practical guide for anyone willing to invest in art. It is important to mention that art has a low correlation with the traditional stock market and has been recently used to diversify one’s portfolio. Thus, the question of determining art as an asset class has been raised many times. Indeed, some actors are still in disagreement and the decision to define art as an asset class still belongs to each of us. As said previously, art investment encompasses two distinct methods, the direct and the indirect one. The direct investment provides less liquidity compared to the <b>indirect</b> <b>investment.</b> The reasons of the investment vary depending on the real purpose of the individual. The direct investment would be, in general, dedicated to personal and aesthetic reasons, whereas the <b>indirect</b> <b>investment</b> through an art fund is evidently chosen for financial purpose thanks to high rates of returns. Indeed, rates of returns for <b>indirect</b> <b>investment</b> can reach more than 25 % in a very short-time period. Furthermore, contemporary art generates the greatest rate of return with an average of 9 % compared to Old Masters, for example, which reach only 5. 52 %. Finally, the risks assessed for the last part are not only related to the works of art, the different parties i. e. buyers and sellers, and the environment but also to financial risks, which are related to the time period and the amount spent on artworks. Final recommendations defined at the chapter four are of interest for prospective passionate individuals or potential private investors. Eventually, researches were mainly done in Switzerland but also in Paris, France {{with the help of an}} independent art dealer in order to have a broader view of the current art market...|$|R
