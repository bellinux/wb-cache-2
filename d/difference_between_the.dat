5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in}} the thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to be much more disruptive to international trade.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Ekkehart Malotki {{challenged}} Whorf's {{analyses of}} Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time.

5|$|Over-provisioning (sometimes spelled as OP, over provisioning, or overprovisioning) is the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> {{physical}} {{capacity of}} the flash memory and the logical capacity presented through the operating system (OS) as available for the user.
