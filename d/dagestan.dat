5|$|The Khazars {{resumed their}} raids on Muslim {{territory}} after the Abbasid succession, reaching deep into Transcaucasia. Nevertheless, although by the 9th century the Khazars had re-consolidated their control over <b>Dagestan</b> {{almost to the}} gates of Derbent itself, they never seriously attempted to challenge Muslim control of the southern Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were {{military}} raids {{undertaken by}} the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores, of what are nowadays Iran, <b>Dagestan,</b> and Azerbaijan. Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids {{took place in the}} late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, and more to the west, in Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle Volga.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} the fortress' territory along the longitudinal axis. It belongs to the domed basilica type of churches, where the bearings join with the side-chapels of the apse. Two pairs of arches divided the longitudinal stretched prayer hall into three naves, the central one of which (with double side-chapels) on the eastern side ends with low staged, half-rounded apse and the side-chapels end with sacristies. They are characterized with stylish iconography, richness of theme and variety of different colors (where blue is dominant). The vertical axis of the building was crowned by a massive dome. The pointed dome with the cylindrical drum has not survived. It was damaged during Tamerlane's invasion and completely demolished in 1784 when the Avar Omar Khan invaded the Transcaucasus from <b>Dagestan.</b> In the 19th century, Viceroy of the Caucasus, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov built a semi-spherical wooden dome covered with iron sheets in place of the original dome. The dome was renovated during Soviet years.|$|E
25|$|In the 7th-8th centuries Arab conquerors {{continually}} {{strove to}} gain a foothold in <b>Dagestan</b> {{in order to maintain}} political hegemony in the North-Eastern Caucasus. At {{the end of a long}} war (730-740), Arab armies (led initially by Maslamah and then by Marwan) captured mountainous <b>Dagestan.</b> During the Arab invasions and in the period following, such principalities as Tabasaran, Dargin, Lak and Avar were active in <b>Dagestan.</b>|$|E

25|$|About 48 {{hours after}} the Moscow Metro bombings a double suicide bombing hit the Caucasian Republic of <b>Dagestan,</b> killing the city police chief amongst others. Russia {{immediately}} drew parallels, saying the two bombings were linked. On April 1 another bombing in <b>Dagestan</b> killed two more people. On April 5, exactly {{a week after the}} Moscow attacks, another bombing in Ingushetia targeting a police barracks drew parallels between that and the <b>Dagestan</b> attacks. It was seen as a fear that these incidents lead to an escalation of violence as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The radical Wahhabist creed of Islam {{arrived to}} <b>Dagestan</b> from Tajikistan {{in the late}} 1980s. Its spread was {{substantially}} sponsored by wealthy Islamist supporters in the Saudi Arabia. In the early 1990s, the Dagestani Wahhabists were led by Bagaudtin Kebedov, who had previously worked with Akhmed-Kadji Akhtaev in the Islamic Party of Revival, until falling out with the more moderate Akhtaev. During the First Chechen War, Bagaudtin traveled to Chechnya to organise Wahhabist militant cells. In <b>Dagestan</b> he became the Amir of Islamic Community of <b>Dagestan.</b> Bagaudtin was the spiritual father of the Dagestani Wahhabism.|$|E

As a physical geographic entity, the Islamic Djamaat of <b>Dagestan</b> finally ceased to exist, but the Dagestani Wahhabists {{continued to have}} a serious presence in the republic, and there is much evidence {{that they have been}} responsible for a long series of terrorist bombings in <b>Dagestan.</b>|$|E

Strong Persian cultural influence can be traced up as far as Tatarstan in central Russia. <b>Dagestan</b> remains the bastion of Persian culture in the North Caucasus with fine examples of Iranian architecture like the Sassanid citadel in Derbent, strong influence of Persian cuisine, and common Persian names amongst the ethnic peoples of <b>Dagestan.</b> The ethnic Persian population of the North Caucasus, the Tats, remain, despite strong assimilation over the years, still visible in several North Caucasian cities. Even today, after decades of partition, some of these regions retain a sort of Iranian identity, as seen in their old beliefs, traditions and customs (e.g. Norouz).|$|E
