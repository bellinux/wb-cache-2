This law represented an operative instrument {{to fight against the}} drug mafia and generally against organized crime in the field of the Romanian <b>judicial</b> <b>organisations.</b> Pursuant to the provisions of Law 143 (4) / 2000, the deed of illicit drug possession for own use has firstly been incriminated, as a reaction of the Romanian society against illicit use of drugs dramatically increasing since 1990. According to the statistic data released by the National Anti-Drug Agency, illicit drug use has been increasing after 2000 although such incrimination was already introduced in the criminal law. Almost eight years after the prohibition of drug possession for own use that has not produced any effects in reducing the number of drug users, the question of changing the criminal philosophy of the Romanian legislator, who leads an extremely harsh repressive politics in the field, may be raised. One proposes in this respect, to remove the drug possession for own use from the illicit criminal sphere and to solve such cases by imposing certain administrative sanctions altogether with some medical procedures/medical care services, the sole able to solve complex drug addiction related problems. Taking into account the reduced social danger of drug possession for own use, as well as for giving higher efficiency to medical standards in the field, with a more substantial preventing effect, the Romanian legislator needs to review its criminal politics of illicit drug use, by re-evaluating the gravity and dangerous effects of drugs possess for own use by its des-incrimination...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the statutory basis of judicial workload allocation, before turning to empirical research findings to investigate the functions performed by the judiciary and the court staff in allocating work. The ultimate responsibility for allocating work in a court rests with the chief judicial officer, either as a specific statutory responsibility {{or as part of}} their general responsibility to manage the court. In practice, other judicial officers and court personnel are involved in work allocation. This article reports on findings from extensive empirical research examining the processes of work organisation in Australian courts. This research has identified the centrality of court officials, as well as the responsible judicial officer, in allocating work. This may include allocating cases to courts or lists; assigning judicial officers to courts or lists; or, in some circumstances, allocating specific cases to judicial officers.

50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{effectiveness of}} this procedure mainly resides {{in that it is}} ex parte and restrictive. The authorisation to perform a saisie-contrefaçon is requested of the President of the tribunal de grande instance with jurisdiction over the territory in question, in ex parte proceedings. Yet Article R. 211-7 of the French <b>Judicial</b> <b>Organisation</b> Code provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for actions in the fields of Community designs and trademarks. The proceedings are ex parte, i.e. without hearing the other party: the requesting party, represented by its attorney-at-law, presents its request to the judge; the person targeted by the saisie-contrefaçon measure is not informed and does not take part in the proceedings. Therefore, the saisie-contrefaçon ordered by the judge will benefit from the element of surprise; until the very last moment, the targeted person is not informed {{of what is going on}} and therefore cannot move or dispose of the evidence of its infringing activity (the result is the same when, in matters of copyright and related rights, a police commissioner, or even a judge, is requested to carry out a saisie-contrefaçon, see French Intellectual Property Code, Art. L. 332-1 and L. 332-4). The great practical effectiveness of the saisie-contrefaçon also lies in its restrictive nature, since the judge, by granting an order to perform a saisie-contrefaçon, authorises the requesting party to call upon a bailiff to enter the premises of the targeted person or even of third parties (if evidence is likely to be found there) to perform the saisie-contrefaçon investigations, regardless of whether or not the premises are normally open to the public.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} power {{struggle between the}} judge and the management board of the court over the criminal trial. This struggle concerns criminal procedural justice interests of swiftness and foreseeability. The judge and the management board are jointly responsible for these interests. The only way to achieve swift and foreseeable administration of criminal cases is to exert influence on the criminal trial. As the criminal trial is {{the domain of the}} judge, the basis of the power struggle is given. Concerning this power struggle, the following questions have been addressed. How does the power struggle between the judge and the management board transpire? Do the contending parties abide by the applicable rules? If not, how should this struggle be qualified from a legal perspective? Does the influence exerted by the management board bring about unlawful judiciary actions in light of criminal procedural justice? Is it even possible for the management board to act in a lawful manner? Are the rules not too strict and are they necessary in guaranteeing judicial independence? Research inferred that the management board does violate the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Organisation</b> Act, yet steer judges {{in a way that is}} not unlawful according to the criminal procedural justice rules. In fact both the legislator and the Supreme Court prefer this approach. These continuous violations are inevitable and do not infringe upon requirements of judicial independence.

The critical themes in this thesis are how a developing country at the low level of development {{as in the case of}} Vietnam, with various distinctiveness in term of economy, society, culture, politics, or legality can enhance its judicial effectiveness in dealing with IP cases in order to fulfil its international obligations under TRIPs Agreement. Despite the importance of the issue, there has not been any research on the first integration of Vietnamese judiciary in line with international regulations on IPRs protection and enforcement applicable to all WTO member states. This thesis will also examine impacts of this international compliance for the Vietnamese judiciary in particular, and to this South East Asian country in general. After analysing the critical situation of IPRs infringements in Vietnam, which lie behind an impetus for change, the thesis will review the historical development of IPRs and main provisions of the TRIPs Agreement. Next, the thesis will examine the definition of judicial effectiveness in special reference to minimum standards as provided in the TRIPs Agreement. I will argue that judicial effectiveness in enforcing IPRs can not be improved to comply with the TRIPs Agreement unless judiciary’s capacity in preventing and deterring IP infringements, <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> and knowledge, and other factors involving legal procedures are enhanced. In the light of above analysis, I will analyse the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> and legal knowledge in dealing with IP cases, and the adequacy of legislation concerning judicial measures for IPRs enforcement. I will also argue that any content of the reform of Vietnamese judiciary to comply with TRIPs Agreement must take into account, inter alia, the distinctiveness of Vietnamese judiciary, and other unique factors of this country in terms of its economy, society, politic and culture...|$|E

50|$|It was his parents, both {{fundamentally}} Carlist, {{who passed}} their intransigent Traditionalist outlook to Matías Barrio.

He joined the insurgency soon afterwards, though {{it is not clear whether}} he served with the combat troops before nomination to Corregidor del señorio de Vizcaya by Carlos VII.

His position in the organization grew once he became a deputy and started speaking in defense of the Carlist cause in the Cortes. With the number of Carlist deputies ranging from 5 to 10, Barrio, along Cesáreo Sanz Escartín, gradually became the most experienced MP and in the late 1890s assumed the post of the Carlist Cortes minority speaker (though the parliamentarian leadership was reserved for the senator, marqués de Cerralbo); by the same time he emerged as the regional Leonese leader and the representative of León in the nationwide structures. He also became one of the movement’s pundits, regularly publishing in the semi-official Carlist daily, El Correo Español. In case the Jefe Delegado, marqués de Cerralbo, was out of the country, it was usually Matías Barrio replacing him.|$|R

At the same time, the judges proclaimed to be highly committed to their work. In this article, we explore this apparent contradiction by studying recent developments in the organisation of the judiciary and in the selection and training of judges. We specifically focus on the consequences that these developments could have on the loyalty of judges. Thereby, we distinguish between loyalty towards the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation,</b> towards the profession, and towards colleagues. In studying the organisational changes, we notice that it is the focus on the new public management principles that is of particular concern to the judges, as many of these principles may conflict with their professional values. We reason that their loyalty towards the organisation seems to have diminished and that the expressed commitment of judges is more a display of loyalty towards the profession and towards colleagues than towards the organisation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{idea that}} “merit” {{should be the}} guiding {{principle}} of judicial selections is a universal principle, unlikely to be contested in whatever legal system. What differs considerably across legal cultures, however, {{is the way in}} which “merit” is defined. For deeper cultural and historical reasons, the current definition of “merit” in the process of judicial selections in the Czech Republic, at least in the way it is implemented in the institutional settings, is an odd mongrel. The old technocratic Austrian judicial heritage has in some aspects merged with, in others was altered or destroyed, by the Communist past. After 1989, some aspects of the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> were amended, with the most problematic elements removed. Furthermore, several old as well as new provisions relating to the judiciary were struck down by the Constitutional Court. However, apart from these rather haphazard interventions, there has been neither a sustained discussion as to how a new judicial architecture and system of judicial appointments ought to look like nor much of broader, conceptual reform in this regard. Thus, some twenty five years after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the guiding principles for judicial selection and appointments are still a debate to be had...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on colonial policies in general acknowledges that, for its colonisation of the Congo, Belgium sided with England and Germany in opting for {{a policy of}} adaptationism (indirect rule), rather than for assimilationism, which was espoused by France and Portugal in their African possessions. However, the juncture in history at which, the reasons why and the ideological backgrounds against which the Belgian authorities decided on this are not well understood. This contribution traces how, in the decades prior to 1918, Belgians in the Congo combined principles of indirect rule {{at the level of}} the political, administrative and <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> of the colony with assimilationist tenets in the domains of language and culture. After World War I this changed dramatically, as the Minister of Colonies, Louis Franck, brought Belgium's indigenous policy fully and irreversibly in line with an encompassing application of adaptationism. This article also shows that adaptationism in the Belgian Congo was never applied to its fullest consequences and implications, but always involved a management of, and active interventions into, the pre-colonial linguistic and cultural diversity it was ostensibly supposed to cherish and defend...|$|E
40|$|For some years, France has {{searched for}} ways to control abuses in the {{judicial}} system. In the “Affaire d’Outreau,” indictment, detention pending trial and conviction was delivered to innocent men and women, just because of witness evidence, which had not been verified by the investigating judge; the resulting public criticism made the French parliament reorganize the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation.</b> This case intensified the crisis of confidence (which already existed) French citizens in the justice system. The Minister of Justice has not {{played an important role}} in curbing abuses, but the Superior Council of the Magistrates (CSM) has dealt with disciplinary prosecutions. Thus, the question remains whether it is possible to create a single institution to handle citizen complaints regarding the malfunctioning of judicial institutions, and various issues arise. Should the Mediator (the institution for complaints against executive institutions of the French state, which is the French equivalent of an Ombudsman) or a special Ombudsman for justice organisations, including courts handle these complaints? Should the CSM be given wider powers? France attempted to address these issues through a law on the responsibility of magistrates. However, this effort was a failure because the text was imprecise (so that the Conseil Constitutionnel censored some clauses) and elaborated without consultation. </span...|$|E
40|$|This PhD project {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of creating a normative way of assessing quality of the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> by arguing that legitimacy {{is related to the}} functioning of the organisation. This further leads to the idea that the judiciary can be held constitutionally accountable for its organisation or lack thereof. This is a comparative thesis looking at the judicial organisations and the constitutional settings of France and the Netherlands. The issue of quantifying and measuring quality in the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> poses an interesting challenge. On the one hand, it has a special status within the separation of powers to uphold the law. In a constitutional state (rechtsstaat) based on a democracy, the checks and balances have been set out to protect judicial independence whilst finding legally conventional ways to hold members of the judiciary to account for the exercise of their power. For the last two centuries, the system has held the three powers in balance in order to protect people from arbitrary abuse of power. Legality has always been the basis upon which public organisations make decisions in a democracy. The same is said for the judiciary. So long as judges followed rules of procedure, no matter how long it took, and how easily manipulated (by lawyers), they were judges were acting within the bounds of legality (due process). This was (and still is) valid in the days of corrupt and partial officials, or of the days of bureaucracy, when there were so many rules that the protection that due process should have afforded was failing and red tape hid the actions of state officials. On the other hand, the judiciary is an organisation with limited resources to fulfil their tasks. Given the fact that their organisation has been ignored due to judicial independence, judiciaries throughout Europe have had to cope with growing caseloads and no organisational solution. Today, therefore, there is a new organisational enemy: ineffectiveness through failure of the organisation to act efficiently. Resources and use thereof are not the only issue in policy today: there is also an issue of timeliness. In the sphere in which the judiciary acts, this is essential as their judgments must be relevant at the time that they are issued. If judgments do not give solutions to problems at the time they are needed, they lack legitimacy. If judgments lack legitimacy, then the judiciary begins to lose the trust of the public. From this thesis, it would appear that quality theories support the function of justice and provide transparent methods for organisation. Furthermore, as regards the organisation, quality methods appear to have given the judiciary in both countries the possibility to examine in closer detail the elements involved in the delivery of effective justice...|$|E
40|$|High-profile bribery {{scandals that}} involve {{powerful}} people and {{large sums of}} money are often the object of general indignation and legal action. When it comes to bribery of the everyday kind, however, it is far less obvious which gifts should be seen as bribes, be it in a moral or legal sense. Legal cases of this kind almost always include voices that strive to refute accusations of bribery. This study sets out to investigate how the people involved construct and argue for their particular version. Seven legal cases of bribery serve as a starting point. They are mainly cases of what would be called petty corruption. The material consists of retrospective interviews with the parties involved (people who reported the matter, policemen, prosecutors, people sentenced with bribery) as well as court records in each case. When counteracting accusations of bribery, interviewee draw on culturally established knowledge of a ”real” bribe: it is given in secret, it consists of a large amount of money, it is supposed to generate favours, it is offered with an ulterior motive of favours, it involves a particular order (first bribery, then favours), and it attracts dishonest persons. People who are found guilty of bribery present another picture. Assertions and proofs of one’s honest intentions and honourable character are put forward in elaborated accounts. Furthermore, one suggests reasons for ”how this could happen to me”, i. e. other people’s malice, bad luck or becoming the victim of a particularly zealous prosecutor. By illustrating their accounts with identifying as well as contrasting comparisons, the interviewees construct a version of events far from the one claimed by the prosecutor. Not only the interviewees who were found guilty of bribery seem to be compelled to explain their actions, but also the prosecutors and those who reported the matter to the police. When cases are described as morally ambiguous the prosecutors refer to rules and laws, thus restricting their options to a minimum. Accounts of this sort imply a reification of the law and picture the <b>judicial</b> <b>organisation</b> as an unstoppable automatic machine processing its material until it is done...|$|E
