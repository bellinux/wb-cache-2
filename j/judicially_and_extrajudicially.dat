25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Nazi Germany, Hungary became a {{satellite}} state of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected Mátyás Rákosi to front the Stalinization of the country, and Rákosi de facto ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's KGB, the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the ÁVH, to enforce the new regime. The purges that followed saw approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956. Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested <b>and</b> <b>extrajudicially</b> interned in domestic and foreign Gulags. Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labor camps, where at least 200,000 died.|$|R

25|$|Thiệu took a {{cautious}} approach, as did Có and Cang, {{and they were}} pre-empted by Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, an undetected communist double agent, who launched a coup with Phát on a hardline Catholic platform without U.S. backing. With U.S. support against both Khánh and the plotters, Kỳ and Thi put down the coup attempt and then ousted Khánh. This left Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu as the three most prominent members in the new junta. There were claims that Thiệu ordered the military to capture <b>and</b> <b>extrajudicially</b> kill Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, who died in 1965 {{after a series of}} coup attempts between various ARVN officers. Other sources blame Kỳ. During this period, Thiệu became more prominent as other generals fought and defeated one another in coups, which forced several into exile.|$|R

50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the powers {{exercised}} by the Panel (regulating take-overs and enforcing a code of conduct on them) were essentially {{in the domain of}} public law and formed part of the Government's scheme to regulate the City.

50|$|This {{is a case}} of the “abuse of {{dominant}} market position”, the first AML private enforcement case that was initially brought to and examined by the provincial High Court, then appealed to and finally judged by the Supreme Court, and by far, the Supreme Court’s written judgement is the best and most professional, both <b>judicially</b> <b>and</b> technically, judicial judgement of its kind ever amongst all AML cases in China. Given the judicial power and nature of the Supreme Court, this judgement established and reaffirmed several very important judicial rules with precedent case law effect insofar as the private enforcement of AML is concerned.|$|R

5000|$|Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio (17 July 1918 - 6 December 2003) was President of Guatemala from 1 July 1970 to 1 July 1974. Arana Osorio {{was born}} in Barberena, in the {{department}} of Santa Rosa. A colonel in the Army, he was elected in an electoral process generally considered [...] "non-transparent" [...] on a platform promising a crackdown on law-and-order issues and stability; his vice president was Eduardo Cáceres. In November 1970, Arana imposed a [...] "State of Siege" [...] which was followed by heightened counterinsurgency measures. The government received continued large-scale military support from the United States, which provided weapons, technical support and military advisors to the security forces under Arana to assist in fighting the guerrillas. The systematic use of state-terrorism which emerged in 1966 under President Julio César Méndez persisted under Arana; government-sponsored [...] "death squads" [...] remained active and the security forces regularly detained, disappeared, tortured <b>and</b> <b>extrajudicially</b> executed political opponents, student leaders, suspected guerrilla sympathizers and trade unionists. It is estimated that over 20,000 Guatemalans were killed or [...] "disappeared" [...] under the Arana administration.|$|R

40|$|America {{has long}} been seen as the capital of {{religious}} freedom and individual rights. In recent years a debate has arisen over whether an individual can personally adhere to the legal concept of sharia law under the protections of the first amendment. At {{the center of this}} debate is precedent that can be drawn from previous interactions between religion and American ideals. Two similar issues that have been settled both <b>judicially</b> <b>and</b> legislatively are the conscientious draft objector and the federal prohibition of polygamy. By studying the roots of Islamic law and then the basis of these two concepts, a synthesized response can be created that equally satisfies the first amendment right to freedom of religion and the safeguarding of American legal precedent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Default on {{sovereign}} debt {{is a form}} of political risk. Issuers and creditors have responded to this risk both by strengthening the terms in {{sovereign debt}} contracts that enable creditors to enforce their debts <b>judicially</b> <b>and</b> by creating terms that enable sovereigns to restructure their debts. These apparently contradictory approaches reflect attempts to solve an incomplete contracting problem in which debtors need to be forced to repay debts in good states of the world; debtors need to be granted partial relief from debt payments in bad states; debtors may attempt to exploit divisions among creditors in order to opportunistically reduce their debt burden; and debtors and creditors may attempt to externalize costs on the taxpayers of other countries. We support this argument with an empirical overview of the development of sovereign bond terms from 1960 to the present...|$|R

2500|$|A 2000 {{article by}} then-UK's Guardian, later BBC, {{correspondent}} Tom Gibb attributes the murder to a detective of the Salvadoran National Police named Oscar Perez Linares, on orders of D'Aubuisson.

[...] The guard, who Gibb identified as [...] "Jorge," [...] purported to have witnessed Linares fraternizing with the group, which was nicknamed the [...] "Little Angels," [...] and to have heard them praise Linares for the killing.

2500|$|This {{case was}} first {{reviewed}} by the PGR in Jalisco, and was then pushed to the SEIDO in Mexico City because this agency was the one responsible for investigating this case. The lawyer of the families criticized the government's decision to move {{the case to the}} SEIDO because it [...] "victimized" [...] them. He also stated that the families were of low-income backgrounds and did not have the resources to go to Mexico City. The lawyer stated that the families went to the forensic medical services installations in Guadalajara to see several bodies the government had sent from Villa Purificación. Although they gave DNA samples at the PGR offices in Jalisco to see if any of the corpses at the morgue matched their samples, investigators told them that they lacked legal jurisdiction and that the DNA results could only be given to them in Mexico City. The lawyer stated that there were verbal accounts that civilians in Villa Purificación were tortured <b>and</b> <b>extrajudicially</b> killed by security forces. He also questioned the government's delay in bringing the bodies to Guadalajara, since believed that this gave investigators an excuse to not investigate the highly decomposed bodies. He also stated that it would be impossible for investigators to prove those killed used any weapons on May 1 or were part of the CJNG.|$|R
