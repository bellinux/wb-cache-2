50|$|Recently, the {{excellent}} properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions {{to overcome the}} challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, giant refractive <b>index</b> <b>modification</b> (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using direct laser writing (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption {{are found to be}} dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{selective}} mode filter inscribed with ultrashort pulses {{directly into a}} few mode large mode area (LMA) fiber. The mode filter consists of two refractive <b>index</b> <b>modifications</b> alongside the fiber core in the cladding. The refractive <b>index</b> <b>modifications,</b> which were of approximately the same order of magnitude as the refractive index difference between core and cladding have been inscribed by nonlinear absorption of femtosecond laser pulses (800 nm wavelength, 120 fs pulse duration). If light is guided in the core, it will interact with the inscribed modifications causing modes to be coupled out of the core. In order to characterize the mode filter, we used a femtosecond inscribed fiber Bragg grating (FBG), which acts as a wavelength and therefore mode selective element in the LMA fiber. Since each mode has different Bragg reflection wavelengths, an FBG in a multimode fiber will exhibit multiple Bragg reflection peaks. In our experiments, we first inscribed the FBG using the phase mask scanning technique. Then the mode filter was inscribed. The reflection spectrum of the FBG was measured in situ during the inscription process using a supercontinuum source. The reflectivities of the LP 01 and LP 11 modes show a dependency {{on the length of}} the mode filter. Two stages of the filter were obtained: one, in which the LP 11 mode was reduced by 60 % and one where the LP 01 mode was reduced by 80 %. The other mode respectively showed almost no losses.
