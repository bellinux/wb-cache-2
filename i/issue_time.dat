The Act, which entitles parents at least 60 {{years old and}} unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them, was the first public law that originated from a private member's bill since Singapore's independence in 1965. In its 5 December 1994 <b>issue,</b> <b>Time</b> magazine picked Woon as one of 100 young world leaders, the only Singaporean to make the list.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} that such a penalty relegated a driver past the back row of the grid, the {{remaining}} penalty carried over to the next race. For example, if a driver qualified in nineteenth position and received a five-place grid penalty, they dropped to twenty-second and last place for that race, and then would receive an additional two-place penalty in the next Grand Prix. These penalties could only be carried over to the next race, rather than accumulate, and only applied to penalties issued for going over the component quota. Penalties cannot be carried over from season to season; when a driver incurred such a penalty during the final race of the season, the stewards {{had the power to}} <b>issue</b> <b>time</b> penalties during the race.|$|E

25|$|Although turncoat mob {{leaders and}} others had long accused Jackie Presser of being a {{government}} informant, the first official confirmation came on August 22, 1981. In its August 31 <b>issue,</b> <b>Time</b> magazine reported that Presser and other Teamsters had served as government informants since the early 1970s to avoid possible prosecution. Presser confirmed that he, his father and Fitzsimmons had met with federal agents, but declared {{that there had been}} only one meeting in 1972. Days later, at least one newspaper retracted the story. Mafia figures had long doubted claims that Presser was an informant, and the retraction helped renew mob confidence in Presser. The mob's confidence in Presser was reaffirmed a year later when the Justice Department publicly ended its investigation into an alleged kickback scheme.|$|E

Pete Seeger's [...] "The Bells Of Rhymney" [...] {{is a prime example}} of the new interpretations of folklore." [...] In its July 1965 <b>issue,</b> <b>Time</b> magazine praised the album by stating [...] "To make folk music the music of today's folk, this quintet has blended Beatle beats with Lead Belly laments, created a halfway school of folk-rock that scores at the cash box if not with the folk purists." [...] In the UK, the NME described the band and its debut album by commenting [...] "They look like a rock group but are really a fine folk unit. They play their stringed instruments with great skill and invention against the rock-steady drumming. [...] Their voices merge well...As the first group to bridge the gap between beat and folk, they deserve to be winners." [...] The UK publication Music Echo was also enthusiastic about the album's contents, concluding that the record was [...] "an album which easily lives up to the promise of their great knock-out singles." ...|$|E
