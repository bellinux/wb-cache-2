Recent applications are reviewed, and an extensive set of new results presented on transition metal compounds. The features of the electronic density and of several calculated properties are examined as {{the weight of the}} HF (exact) exchange in the hybrid functional is increased. Clear trends emerge in the structural and electronic properties; in particular, HF exchange increases the <b>electronic</b> <b>localisation.</b> This features causes an increase in the ionicity of the materials, a systematic decrease of the lattice parameter and increase of the elastic constants and bulk moduli. When HF and standard (LDA or GGA) DFT solutions yield systematically errors with opposite sign with respect to experiment, the formulation of hybrid functionals improves the accuracy of the calculations. This is the case for band gaps, phonon spectra, magnetic coupling constants, and all properties that depend on the extent of <b>electronic</b> <b>localisation</b> at either perfect or defective lattice sites. A different weight of HF exchange is required to reproduce the experimental value of different observables; as a general rule, however, a higher fraction of HF exchange than the 20 % optimised in the molecular B 3 LYP formulation is required in the solid state...|$|R

International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a vision based localization system {{which can be}} used {{on a wide range of}} mobile vehicles. The principle of the algorithm developed is to merge the information given by a vision system with the data extracted from the moves of the vehicle. The image processing level is performed by using principal components analysis that allows low cost position estimation by using a representative set of images obtained during an initial exploration of the environment. This set of images makes it possible to represent the environment as a partially observable Markov decision process. The originality of this approach is the resulting data fusion process that uses both image matching and decision made by the robot in order to estimate the set of plausible positions of the robot and the associated probabilities. Furthermore, this stochastic <b>localisation</b> <b>device</b> shows better results compared with the classical methods such as static neighborhoods.

The electronic structures of these compounds were computed using various DFT codes, based either on plane waves PAW potentials (VASP), or on all-electron basis sets in the FPLAPW formalism (Wien 2 K).

Analysis of the X-ray diffraction and variable temperature Mossbauer data for 1 clearly shows the presence of localised valence states for iron atoms at and below 100 K. Both physical methods agree that compound 1 exhibits a continuously growing degree of electron transfer (ET) between the three iron sites with increasing temperature; however, the extent of ET is significantly larger {{for one of the}} iron(III) sites. All three terminal gamma-pic groups remain ordered at and below room temperature, whereas the gamma-pic solvent molecules have a temperature dependent disorder over a number of positions. The distribution of the solvent over disorder positions is suggested to influence the degree of ET between the metal sites. From the molecular geometry in the Fe 3 O-core, an estimate of 260 cm(- 1) in energy difference between the two vibronic states corresponding to <b>electronic</b> <b>localisation</b> on either of the two iron atoms involved in ET is obtained.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of short and ultrashort laser pulses with very thin films is currently an important {{area of research}} for laser material interactions. The interaction between the laser pulse and the thin transparent conductive film {{is key to the}} fabrication of touch panel sensors, light emitting devices, and photovoltaics. This thesis presents results obtained from an investigation of short and ultra-short pulses with very thin transparent conducting oxide films (TCOs). The experiments were all performed on indium tin oxide (ITO), which remains of critical importance to the many applications of TCOs in the industrial sector. The selective patterning processes was characterised for nanosecond, picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses, using off-line techniques such as atomic force microscopy and real time plasma imaging. The results were analysed by the development of multi-physics simulations based on finite element modelling techniques. The film removal process was found to be dependent on laser wavelength, laser pulse duration, substrate material, and other beam delivery properties such as numerical aperture, laser spot radius, and laser shot number. In nanosecond laser patterning, selective removal of the ITO film on glass substrates, for pulses with photon energies less than the ITO direct transition bandgap, is found to be non-ablative, principally driven by thermal melt flow. Pulses with photon energies greater than the bandgap result in ablation by vaporisation. The laser spot overlap is an important parameter for selective patterning; high shots per area result in film removal with smoother profiles and less glass damage. Also for nanosecond processing, the size of the laser spot was found to affect the threshold fluence; this is interpreted using an <b>electronic</b> <b>localisation</b> and diffusion model in the thesis. In ultrashort laser patterning of ITO on glass substrates, the film removal process was found to be highly dependent on the applied laser fluence for picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses. The development and application of a two temperature simulation model, predicts that film ablation is principally driven by ultrafast lattice deformation. This is induced by the hot electron blast force, which leads to fracture of the ITO film at the film grain boundaries. Film removal of ITO on flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer substrates, was found to be through thermo-elastic thin film delamination. The delamination process is found to be principally generated by the thermal expansion of the PET substrate during laser heating. This release mechanism was found to be independent of the wavelength and pulse duration studied. The selective patterning process is characterised by the ability to create a clean removal process using low numbers of shots per unit area. Finally, the study examined the dependence of laser processing with a spatial beam profile using custom fabricated diffractive optics. A novel two-step fabrication method was used to generate high efficiency reflective diffractive optics. The spatially shaped, top-hat, laser beam profile was used to selectively remove the ITO thin film, which resulted in optimal processing, consisting of minimised re-solidified crater edges for nanosecond pulses. In summary, the thesis provides a concise in-depth study highlighting the opportunities for selectively patterning highly degenerate semiconductors used as TCOs in current and future devices...|$|R

The use of inertial sensors and short-range radio can reduce reliance on GPS to prolong the operational lifetime of tracking devices, but they only provide coarse-grained control over GPS activity. In this paper, we introduce our feature-rich lightweight Camazotz platform as an enabler of Multimodal Activity-based Localisation (MAL), which detects activities of interest by combining multiple sensor streams for fine-grained control of GPS sampling times. Using the case study of long-term flying fox tracking, we characterise the tracking, connectivity, energy, and activity recognition performance of our module under both static and 3 -D mobile scenarios. We use Camazotz to collect empirical flying fox data and illustrate the utility of individual and composite sensor modalities in classifying activity. We evaluate MAL for flying foxes through simulations based on retrospective empirical data. The results show that multimodal activity-based localisation reduces the power consumption over periodic GPS and single sensor-triggered GPS by up to 77 % and 14 % respectively, and provides a richer event type dissociation for fine-grained control of GPS sampling...|$|R
40|$|Cherry (1955) {{discovered}} {{that if a}} subject listens to a passage of prose presented to one ear and repeats it aloud, he remains ignorant of the content, though not of the general characteristics, of another, different prose passage presented simultaneously to his other ear. The present thesis examines {{the nature of this}} selective blocking of content in selective dichotic listening, suggests a model for the mechanisms involved, discusses the relations between this and other "kinds" of attention, and speculates on the neurophysiological mechanisms involved. Using Cherry's original technique it is shown that even if the rejected passage is a list of seven words repeated 55 times it leaves no detectable trace (Chapter XI). Certain stimuli can break down this block, however, and these seem to be "important" stimuli such as the subject's own name. An attempt to make a word "important" by pairing it with electric shock la described, with another attempt to change the affective value of stimuli by giving the subject instructions to alter his "set*. The first of these attempts was successful (chapter IV). The block appears to be extraordinarily effective, since the subject's attention does not switch even when there is a considerable disparity in loudness between the two messages (Chapter III). A review is given of some of the recent work on selective listening, and {{on the basis of this}} a model is suggested for the mechanisms which underlie the observed phenomena. The model supposes that the input from either ear is treated in two ways. One pathway from the ear to perceptual mechanisms treats words simply as sounds, and this pathway is not blocked in selective dichptic listening. But there is a second pathway, which leads to the higher analytical mechanisms which treat sounds as words, and in selective listening this may be blocked below the level of conscious perception. The signals passing into the central nervous system are sampled by a <b>localisation</b> <b>device,</b> which compares the two inputs and takes a decision as to whether one or more messages are present and where they are localised. The subject's voluntary decision to listen to one ear and not the other "biasses" the system towards accepting signals along one input pathway rather than the other, unless the <b>localisation</b> <b>device</b> decides there is only one message present in a position which renders the voluntary selection impossible. The brain receives the early parts of the message, and on the basis of past experience of the transitional probabilities between the signals of a language, it predicts what signals are likely to appear later in the message. Whichever input channel receives a message which most nearly matches these predictions will tend to be accepted (Chapter III). Modifications of this basic model are suggested to deal with the role of "important" signals, and situations involving more than two messages (Cbapter IV). Various experiments to test the model are described, such as one in which the transitional probabilities between signals are varied by using statistical approximations to English. Further, if the same message is sent to the two ears, but with a large time difference between the arrival of a given word at the ears, the subject does not realise that they are the same message if he listens to one of them. If he listens to, and repeats, the one which leads in time he realises that they are the same (his attention breaks down) when the two messages are as much as six or more seconds apart. If he listens to the one which lags in time this only happens wben the messages are less than 1 Â½ seconds apart. The difference is shown not to be an artefact of the time taken to repeat what is heard, which takes only about 1 second. The difference would be predicted by the model, and is related to it in discussion. Other data from the review are also related to the model. Two phenomena which bear on the general problem of selective listening are discussed - the time taken to switch attention, and the apparent diversity of the "kinds" of attention. The failure to break down the subject's attention by "setting" him with instructions raised the question of switching time, for one of the conditions used in that experiment was such that the estimate of switching time of attention made by Broadbent (1954), and similar work by the writer, should have allowed the subject ample time to switch to that message for which he was set. An experiment is described which produces results which differ from Broadbent's as regards switching time, and which cast doubt on his "Filter Theory" model. He has suggested that there is a very short term memory store peripheral to a filter which can select one of the possible channels through which signals enter the nervous system, but the data here presented show that the effect of the rate of presentation upon recall of stimuli in an immediate memory experiment is not such as would support Broad- bent's model. A critique of the rationale of experiments on switching time is given, pointing out that the present experimental designs are inadequate to ensure that the subject is indeed switching (Chapter V). The way in which the concept of attention has been used in modern experimental psychology is reviewed, and four apparently distinct uses are described. Firstly there is the "mentalistic" use of the early experimental psychologists, such as Wundt and Titchener. Secondly, there is the use in vigilance experiments, which seem best described as a prolonged task of signal/noise discrimination. Thirdly, there is the use such as is found in the present thesis, where attention refers to the selection of one from a number of possible channels along which signals may arrive. Lastly, there is the use in the sense of "mental concent- ration". Titchener's list of attention-catching stimuli is compared with the results found in selective dichotic listening. It is suggested that it would be both useful and possible to enquire whether separate mechanisms underlie those different uses of the concept of attention, and a start is made in this direction by showing that there is no significant correlation between scores on a test of concentration and scores on a listening-and-repeating situation (Chapter VI). In considering the neurophysiology of these phenomena the evidence about four parts of the mechanism is assessed. Firstly evidence is brought from ablation studies in animals and dysphasia in humans to show that the meaning-analysis mechanisms of the brain can be affected without affecting those responsible for comparatively crude discriminations. For example in word deafness aphasia there is little or no lose in auditory sensitivity as measured with an audiometer, but the meaning of words and tunes is utterly lost. Secondly, the position of the auditory localisation mechanisms is considered, and that for comparing the early and later parts of messages received. It is tentatively concluded that the auditory localisation mechanisms are located in the olivary nuclei of the trapezoid body; and that a pathway from the parieto-temporal area of the cortex which is brought into relation with the afferent inflow by way of a circuit involving the reticular formation may be the mechanism of the prediction devices. Thirdly, the level of the block for meaning is discussed. On the basis of ablation studies in animals, GSR conditioning experiments in the awake human, and EEG studies of the ability of the sleeping human to discriminate between signals, it is suggested that the block lies between the auditory cortex and the reticular formation. Lastly, the question of the way in which "switching" of the attention is brought about is discussed. It is tentatively suggested that the initial "biassing" of the system is through a fronto-reticular pathway, and that the reticular formation is probably the centre of the system, where the several factors responsible for producing the particular response observed on any given occasion interact to produce the final result (Chapter VII). In a final chapter a recapitulation of the model is given together with a brief discussion of the writer's attitude to models in general. The present thesis is considered as a preliminary progress report on work in a field which seems to be as yet untouched except by the writer and Taylor (1960). Points of particular interest are noted and a programme of research using both behavioural and neurophysiological techniques is indicated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{integration}} of geographical coordinates into a picture has {{become more and more}} popular. Indeed almost all smartphones and many cameras today have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location information in the Exif header when a picture is taken. Although the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures is often ignored by smart phone users as it can lead to endless discussions about privacy implications, these geotags could be really useful for investigators in analysing criminal activity. Currently, there are many free tools as well as commercial tools available in the market that can help computer forensics investigators to cover a wide range of geographic information related to criminal scenes or activities. However, there are not specific forensic tools available to deal with the geolocation of pictures taken by smart phones or cameras.

Moreover, this new tool is portable; investigators can run it on any operating system without any installation. Another useful feature is to be able to work in a read-only environment, so that forensic results will not be modified.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{ability to}} localise objects and persons {{is a useful}} ability, that is {{currently}} used in everyday life {{in the form of}} Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. Localisation is also useful in data networks. The ability to localise nodes in a network paves the way for applications such as location based services, beamforming and geographic routing. The Radio Interferometric Positioning System (RIPS), is a method originally designed for localisation in wireless sensor networks. RIPS is a promising method {{due to the fact that}} it is capable of localisation with high accuracy over long ranges. This is something which other existing methods are not capable of. RIPS makes localisation measurements in a different manner from conventional methods. Instead of making pairwise measurements between a transmitter and receiver, RIPS uses sets of four nodes in each of its measurements. Furthermore, RIPS requires multiple measurements to obtain the correct RIPS measurement value. This value is referred to as a q–range. Multiple q–ranges are required in order to localise a node. This creates overhead in terms of co–operation between the nodes participating in a RIPS measurement. The focus of this research is to provide a possible solution to this problem of overhead. In this dissertation an investigation is launched into the considerations and benefits of implementing RIPS on a single node. This is done by creating a conceptual design for a single wireless node capable of implementing RIPS through the use of multiple antennas. In order to test this conceptual device, a simulation model is created. This simulation model is then validated, verified and used in experiments designed to test the effects of certain design considerations and variables on the conceptual <b>device’s</b> <b>localisation</b> accuracy. The analysis of the results from these experiments shows that the conceptual device’s use of multiple antennas makes RIPS sensitive to errors. Increasing the distances separating the conceptual device’s antennas is found to decrease this sensitivity to errors. This is shown to be caused by the distances separating the antennas imposing limits on the range of q–ranges values that are possible, with smaller distances resulting in smaller ranges of possible q–range values. It is also found that the use of higher frequencies in RIPS measurements results in greater accuracy. This is with the assumption that these frequencies can be accurately transmitted. Master...|$|R
40|$|MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{focus of}} this study was to {{investigate}} an alternative and more cost effective solution for occupancy sensing in commercial office buildings. The intended purpose of this solution is to aid in efficient energy management. The main requirements were that the proposed solution made use of existing infrastructure only, and provided a means to focus on occupant location. This research was undertaken due to current solutions making use of custom occupancy sensors that are relatively costly and troublesome to implement. These solutions focus mainly on monitoring environmental changes, and not the physical locations of the occupants themselves. Furthermore, current occupancy sensing solutions are unable to provide proximity and timing information that indicate how far an occupant is located from a specific area, or how long the occupant resided there. The research question was answered by conducting a proof of concept study with data simulated in the OMNeT++ environment in conjunction with the MiXiM framework for wireless networks. The proposed solution investigated the fidelity of existing WiFi infrastructure for occupancy sensing, this entailed the creation of a Virtual Occupancy Sensor (VOS) that implemented RSS-based localisation for an occupant’s WiFi <b>devices.</b> <b>Localisation</b> was implemented with three different location estimation techniques; these were trilateration, constrained nearest neighbour RF mapping and unconstrained nearest neighbour RF mapping. The obtained positioning data was interpreted by a developed intelligent agent that was able to transform this regular position data into relevant occupancy information. This information included a distance from office measurement and an occupancy result that can be interpreted by existing energy management systems. The accuracy and operational behaviour of the developed VOS were tested with various scenarios. Sensitivity analysis and extreme condition testing were also conducted. Results showed that the constrained nearest neighbour RF mapping approach is the most accurate, and is best suited for occupancy determination. The created VOS system can function correctly with various tested sensitivities and device loads. Furthermore results indicated that the VOS is very accurate in determining room level occupancy although the accuracy of the position coordinate estimations fluctuated considerably. The operational behaviour of the VOS could be validated for all investigated scenarios. It was determined that the developed VOS can be deemed fit for its intended purpose, and is able to give indication to occupant proximity and movement timing. The conducted research confirmed the fidelity of WiFi infrastructure for occupancy sensing, and that the developed VOS can be considered a viable and cost effective alternative to current occupancy sensing solutions.
