5|$|The {{graphics}} and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna {{of the open}} computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game {{as an example of}} how graphics co-processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics-intensive computer applications. They noted that the fast-paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal computer at that time (1992) without an expensive <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> and regardless of CPU speed. The music of the game, composed by Masatomo Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo, has remained popular years after the game's release. Samantha Amjadali of the Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002. Video game cover band The Advantage's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game's dungeon levels.|$|E

50|$|The {{keyboard}} was a Micro Switch 103SD30-2, or a KeyTronic P2441 for the German market. The memory-mapped, bit-mapped {{frame buffer}} (<b>graphics)</b> <b>board</b> had {{a resolution of}} 1024×1024 pixels, but only 1024×800 was displayed on the monitor. The <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> included hardware to accelerate raster operations. A Ball model HD17H 17-inch video display monitor was used. An Ethernet board was available, originally implementing the 3 Mbit/s Xerox PARC Ethernet specification, which was later upgraded to the 3Com 10 Mbit/s version. An Interphase SMD 2180 disk controller could be installed to connect up to four Fujitsu 84 MB M2313K or CDC 16.7 MB (8.35 MB fixed, 8.35 MB removable) 9455 Lark drives. All of the boards were installed in a 6 or 7-slot Multibus card cage.|$|E
50|$|The {{bit pattern}} for each text character's raster image was {{maintained}} in RAM {{and could be}} modified by the user. With clever programming the display's ability to present fine lines provided by the 640x400 screen resolution could be accessed in text mode even without the optional <b>graphics</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|CAD Overlay {{was derived}} from a custom AutoCAD {{application}} developed using the Nth Engine <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> in 1987 by David Chassin for Image Integration Technology, a scanning service bureau in Schenectady, New York.

50|$|The 380Z used a Z80 {{microprocessor}} (hence the name) {{with up to}} 56 KB of user RAM. When {{fitted with}} an optional floppy disk drive the system ran the CP/M operating system. The basic system came with a text-only monochrome video card, which could be enhanced with a 320×192 high-resolution <b>graphics</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|Output {{from the}} <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> was mixed with output from the text-only video card, {{allowing}} text and graphics {{to be easily}} overlaid. The graphics output only covered the top 20 lines of the text display and therefore text output could be set to only use the bottom 4 lines if overlap was not desired.|$|E

In 2002 the company acquired the Intense3D group to become a vertically integrated <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> vendor supplying workstation graphics card under the RealiZm brand. 3Dlabs stopped developing graphics GPUs and cards in 2006 to focus on its media processor business.|$|E

50|$|A {{modified}} version, OTI087X, {{was implemented}} on many Weitek P9000-based <b>graphics</b> <b>boards</b> as a companion VGA controller; unfortunately, the chip was typically configured {{with a narrow}} 8-bit data path to its own dedicated VGA memory, resulting in sub-par VGA mode performance.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphics}} mode available were MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA and SVGA emulating Hercules graphic cards with 512 KiB to 2 MiB RAM, {{and up to}} 256 colors on Amiga AGA machines, and could make use of Amiga <b>graphic</b> <b>boards</b> (e.g. Cybergraphics, EGS Spectrum, Picasso).|$|R
50|$|One 1K bank allowed {{redefinition}} {{of most of}} its 128 ASCII based characters in 8&times;8 pixel bitmap format. The other 1K bank stored the full screen display of 24 rows × 32 columns of characters in black and white. Colour could be achieved as expansion. Although a colour <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> was designed none was ever produced commercially.|$|E
50|$|CyberVision PPC and BlizzardVision PPC (BVision PPC) were <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> add-ons for CyberStorm PPC and Blizzard PPC {{accelerator}} boards. BlizzardVision PPC {{could be}} fitted into an Amiga 1200 desktop case. They had a RAMDAC with a bandwidth of 230 MHz capable to display resolutions with 80 Hz vertical refresh rate up to 1152×900 pixels at 24 bits or 1600×1200 pixels at 16 bits.|$|E

50|$|In {{the latter}} half of 2006, ATI {{introduced}} the Radeon X1950 XTX. This is a <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> using a revised R580 GPU called R580+. R580+ is the same as R580 except for support of GDDR4 memory, a new graphics DRAM technology that offers lower power consumption per clock and offers a significantly higher clock rate ceiling. X1950 XTX clocks its RAM at 1 GHz (2 GHz DDR), providing 64.0 GB/s of memory bandwidth, a 29% advantage over the X1900 XTX. The card was launched on August 23, 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Model 4 has {{the ability}} to display 640×240 or 512×192 {{high-resolution}} monochrome graphics with an optional board which attaches to a socket connector on the logic board. The Radio Shack Model 4 <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> retailed for $249 and included a modified version of Microsoft BASIC (called BasicG) with commands for drawing basic geometric shapes and manipulating arrays in graphics RAM. The graphics screen memory was separate from the usual character screen, and the two could be displayed together or separately. A third-party company called Micro Labs based in Richardson Texas sold a compatible <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> which was popular because it was sold for only $199 (initially). It came with a different BASIC providing for graphics commands called GBasic. Whereas the Radio Shack board had 32KB of graphics RAM, the Micro Labs board had 20KB. Since only 19,200 bytes are required to render a 640 x 240 pixel screen, the additional RAM on the Radio Shack board was available for windowing the viewable screen around a larger virtual area. The graphics RAM was accessible through four Z-80 I/O ports and was especially easy to access for uses other than graphics. For example, there was a public domain utility called Grafdisk that added the graphics memory to regular banked memory to create a larger TRSDOS ramdisk (96K on the Radio Shack board).|$|E
50|$|Four {{different}} Odyssey-based VPro <b>graphics</b> <b>board</b> revisions existed, designated V6, V8, V10 and V12. The {{first series}} were the V6 and V8, with 32MB and 128MB of RAM respectively; the V10 and V12 had double the geometry {{performance of the}} older V6/V8, but were otherwise similar. The V6 and V10 can have up to 8MB RAM allocated to textures, while V8 and V12 can have up to 108MB RAM used for textures. The V10 and V12 boards used in Fuel, Tezro and Onyx 3000 computers use a different XIO connector than the cards used in Octane2 workstations.|$|E
