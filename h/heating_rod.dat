40|$|This project aims at {{designing}} and implementing a fuzzy controller for Multiple Input Single Output temperature process. Temperature control {{of water in}} the tank is achieved by varying current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> and inlet flow rate by a fuzzy controller. The system consists of a tank, reservoir, variable speed pump, temperature sensor placed inside a heating tank containing the <b>heating</b> <b>rod,</b> voltage controlled current source and computer. Water is pumped into the tank from reservoir and RTD measures the current temperature. The signal from the temperature sensor is sent to the DAQ interfaced to the computer. LabVIEW software is used to acquire the input signal and send the output signal that is determined by the control algorithm. Fuzzy logic controller is designed in LabVIEW. Based on the set point temperature, the controller sets the appropriate current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod.</b> If the required temperature is less than that sensed by the temperature sensor, the flow rate of water into the tank is controlled by a variable speed pump. While conventional controllers are analytically described by a set of equations, the FLC is described by a knowledge-based algorithm. Thus this system is highly efficient in both heating and reducing the temperature of the tank. A fuzzy logic controller gives faster response, is more reliable and recovers quickly from system upsets. It also works well to uncertainties in the process variables and it does not require mathematical modelling...|$|E

In order to better understand this phenomena for the specific geometry of vertical, <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> in water, an experimental facility was designed and constructed at Oregon State University. This facility, named the Laser-Imaged Natural Circulation (LINC) facility, consists of a water tank capped with a custom cooling plate through which two <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> pass into the tank. The LINC facility enables flow patterns in the channel between the <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> to be imaged and quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV).

Critical Heat Flux (CHF) is one important parameter to control heat during transient accident. The methodology of research is an experiment using experiment apparatus called HeaTiNG- 01 test section with modifications in the outside pipe using stainless steel material as the reactor vessel wall simulation. Experiments were conducted by <b>heating</b> the <b>heated</b> <b>rod</b> as a simulation of debris until the desired initial temperature by bilateral heated. Then water with a saturation temperature in atmospheric was poured gravitationally into the narrow channel. Data acquisition system recorded temperature changes in transient during the cooling process. The transient temperature profile in double heating surface and rewetting point (rewet fronts) was characterized. Experiment was conducted at three initial temperature variations i. e. 650 oC, 750 oC and 850 oC and using channel width 1 mm.

40|$|AbstractIn Sweden, around 10 % of {{the energy}} {{supplied}} to the district heating networks are lost through heat losses from the distribution pipes.

In the twin pipe concept, the vacuum insulation panel cover the supply pipe. This creates a complex temperature profile over the section and measured results on single pipes might not be applicable.

Less rigid filament structure of catfish Mf than tilapia Mf was demonstrated by studying chymotryptic digestion at various pH. Accordingly, difference S- 1 /rod denaturation pattern for two fish species was explained by the different rigidity of myosin filaments...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} subcooled {{nucleate}} boiling flow in a vertical channel at low-pressure conditions is proposed, with specific {{application to the}} case of boiling in an annulus with a central <b>heating</b> <b>rod.</b> The model consists of a three-dimensional bubble-tracking model and a two-dimensional two-fluid model, which are coupled off-line. In the bubble-tracking model, vapour is distributed in the liquid in the form of individually tracked bubbles. The overall behaviour of the liquid-vapour system results from motion, interaction, coalescence and boiling mechanisms prescribed mostly at the level of bubbles. In the two-fluid model, the so-called “interpenetrating continua ” approach is used, where each phase is treated as a continuum that fills up the entire control volume and is described by its own system of averaged equations for mass, momentum and energy. The two-fluid model used in the present work consists of a generic two-fluid model, which is implemented within the Computational Fluid Dynamics code CFX, and additional closure relations introduced by the authors. The proposed model was applied to experiments on subcooled boiling that were carried out at Purdue University (USA) by Bartel (1999) and Situ et al. (2004).

Various types of military weapon utilize TNT in casting process. However, the TNT casting process for warhead is difficult to control the cooling rate of the liquid TNT.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{hydrogen production}} based on methanol-steam reforming (MSR) using a micro-scale cylindrical packed bed reformer. The reformer wall {{is included in}} the physical model. The heat required for the reforming reaction is supplied either internally using a <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> placed along the center of the reformer or externally by a heat flux applied at the reformer outer wall. Our results show that the thermal resistance from the heat source to the reformer environment {{plays an important role in}} the reformer performance. This thermal resistance depends on the reformer geometry, wall material and heat transfer coefficients inside the catalyst bed and outside the reformer. Based on our numerical results, it is suggested that better methanol conversion and hydrogen yield can be obtained using reformer wall material with low thermal conductivity and thin thickness. For both internal and external heating under the same heat rate supply, no significant difference in reformer performance was found. A water gas shift (WGS) reaction model was included in the present numerical model. In the reformer low-temperature zone the forward WGS reaction was clearly demonstrated, resulting in a decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity. In the high temperature zone the backward WGS reaction was also clearly demonstrated in which CO selectivity increases with the increase in temperature. For both internal and external heating under the same heat rate supply, our results indicated that CO selectivity is about thirty times lower when the WGS reaction is neglected.

40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypotheses that local somatothermal stimulation on the left median nerve territory increases myocardial heat shock protein 70 and that preconditioning of rats with local somatothermal stimulation protects the hearts against subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methods: Local somatothermal stimulation was brought about by means of application of a <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> over and above the left median nerve territory (1. 5 cm proximal to the palm crease) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. After rats were treated with local somatothermal stimulation, the gene expression of heat shock protein 70 in regional muscle, heart, and liver was assessed by means of Western blotting and reverse transcription—polymerase chain reaction. In addition, durations of arrhythmia, mortality rates, and mitochondrial functions were compared between groups preconditioned with or without local somatothermal stimulation followed by subsequent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Results: The results showed that the gene expression of heat shock protein 70 was upregulated in the muscle beneath the area of local somatothermal stimulation, {{as well as in the}} heart, although not in the liver. When animals were preconditioned with local somatothermal stimulation on the left median nerve territory followed by subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart, there were significant decreases of creatine kinase level from the heart, duration of arrhythmia, mortality rate, and improved mitochondrial respiratory function compared with that seen in those without local somatothermal stimulation preconditioning.

40|$|Abstract—Vibration {{characteristics}} of subcooled flow boiling on thin and long {{structures such as}} a <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> were recently investigated by the author. The {{results show that the}} intensity of the subcooled boiling-induced vibration (SBIV) was influenced strongly by the conditions of the subcooling temperature, linear power density and flow velocity. Implosive bubble formation and collapse are the main nature of subcooled boiling, and their behaviors are the only sources to originate from SBIV. Therefore, in order to explain the phenomenon of SBIV, it is essential to obtain reliable information about bubble behavior in subcooled boiling conditions. This was investigated at different conditions of coolant subcooling temperatures of 25 to 75 °C, coolant flow velocities of 0. 16 to 0. 53 m/s, and linear power densities of 100 to 600 W/cm. High speed photography at 13, 500 frames per second was performed at these conditions. The results show that even at the highest subcooling condition, the absolute majority of bubbles collapse very close to the surface after detaching from the heating surface. Based on these observations, a simple model of surface tension and momentum change is introduced to offer a rough quantitative estimate of the force exerted on the heating surface during the bubble ebullition. The formation of a typical bubble in subcooled boiling is predicted to exert an excitation force in the order of 10 - 4 N.
