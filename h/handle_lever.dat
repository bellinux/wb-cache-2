These changes may act upon a diaphragm or a piston which in turn activates the valve, examples {{of this type of}} valve found commonly are safety valves fitted to hot water systems or boilers.|$|E
50|$|An AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm {{deep and}} 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover {{on the bottom}} of the printed circuit board to limit {{electromagnetic}} interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector <b>handle</b> (<b>lever)</b> actuates a microswitch to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines.|$|E
50|$|The {{range is}} a new {{generation}} of fire extinguisher designed in response to customer demand. Incorporating innovative features, this is the most user-friendly design of fire extinguishers released this century. With a new quick release mechanism and an ergonomically redesigned <b>handle,</b> <b>lever</b> and hose grip, the Chubb range is easier to use and many models offer improved fire ratings.In terms of the safety release mechanism, the traditional ‘pin’ that prevents the extinguisher from being discharged accidentally has been replaced with an Easy-Pull Clip with arrows to show a clear direction of ‘pull’ in order to activate the extinguisher. The photoluminescent version ensures the clip is visible even if the lights fail. When the clip is pulled, the word ‘USED’ then appears.|$|E

50|$|The Sycamore {{is powered}} by a single Alvis Leonides piston engine, capable of {{outputting}} 550 hp of thrust. The engine is mounted on below and {{to the rear of the}} main rotor on a flexible mounting in order to reduce vibrations. It is isolated within a fireproof casing, the compartment is also fitted with fire extinguishing equipment that conformed with the relevant regulations of the era. Cooling is achieved via air drawn through a forward-set grill, actively cooling the gearbox prior to passing through the engine cowling and exiting the fuselage. Control of the engine is linked to the collective pitch lever, power being automatically controlled by the rotor pitch setting being commanded; fine adjustment of engine power is achieved via twisting actions on the pitch <b>handle</b> <b>lever.</b> The Sycamore had a relatively high rotor speed for the era, which was claimed to deliver increased smoothness during flight and provide for a safety advantage in the event of engine failure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Effect of {{material}} change of plastic product is investigated {{in this research}} paper. The parameter observed are waste recycle, impact property of product, aesthetic look, cycle time, production rate and cost of product. In this study {{it was found that}} by changing the material of product from thermoset plastic to thermoplast plastic and production process from compression molding to injection molding, the product becomes eco friendly because thermoplast material is recyclable. It was also found that impact strength and production rate/hour was also improved due to reduction in cycle time. The aesthetic look: smoothness of surface and glossy look of the product was become better and long lasting. And finally the cost of product was reduced tremendously.

When no downward force is applied to the <b>lever</b> <b>handle,</b> the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage.

5000|$|He {{trained as}} a {{shoemaker}} in Baťa’s Zlín factory, then as locksmith and later as engineer. He studied under prominent Czech sculptor Vincenc Makovský at Zlín’s Art School from 1939 where he became interested in industrial design. He graduated there in 1943. He continued to work at Zlín for Baťa creating body designs for vertical drilling machines. In 1947 he founded an industrial design studio in the Zlín Technical College. From 1959 he taught at the Institute of Arts & Crafts in Prague. Kovář was also a sculptor. His industrial designs involved projects for scissor and tool <b>handles,</b> <b>lever</b> door <b>handles,</b> sewing machines, lathes, typewriters, film projectors, record players. His most well-known proposals are for the Tatra truck bodies for types T137 and T138 (1956-1958) and studies for the passenger car Tatra T603 (1954). His design for scissors handles in 1952 anticipated similar product designed products produced in the West, such as Olaf Backstrom's excellent scissors (1960), produced by Fiskars in 1967.|$|R

5000|$|Propulsion was by an inclined, three-cylinder {{steam engine}} below the main deck {{with only the}} main bearing tops, upper parts of the valves and <b>handling</b> <b>levers</b> above the main deck. The engine was unique in using a Walschaert gear, {{normally}} used on locomotives, to drive a Corliss gear for the two low-pressure cylinders and the poppet type valves on the high-pressure portion. The speed guarantee of 22 mph was met by the engine's indicated horsepower of [...] at 31 revolutions per minute. The high-pressure cylinder, 66 in in diameter, was centered between the two low-pressure cylinders of 96 in diameter with steam provided by six single ended and three double ended Scotch boilers forward of the engine room delivering steam at 165 pounds per square inch. The single ended boilers were 14 ft inside diameter by 10 ft length and the double ended boilers were 14 ft mean diameter by 20 ft length. The two 32 ft diameter paddle wheels each had eleven steel buckets 14 ft long by 5 ft wide. Due to the restricted channels at both Cleveland and Buffalo additional maneuvering capability was required and a bow rudder and steam steering engine were provided.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of door <b>handle</b> is the <b>Lever</b> latch door <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle has a latch {{which is used to}} keep the door shut. The door handle features only a <b>lever</b> <b>handle</b> which operates this latch. When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of door handle is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The <b>lever</b> latch <b>handle</b> is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|R

50|$|The classic {{hand grenade}} design has a safety <b>handle</b> or <b>lever</b> (known in the US forces as the spoon) and a {{removable}} safety pin that prevents the handle from being released: the safety lever is spring-loaded, {{and once the}} safety pin is removed, the lever will release and ignite the detonator, then fall off. Thus, to use a grenade, the lever is grasped (to prevent release), then the pin is removed, and then the grenade is thrown, which releases the lever and ignites the detonator, triggering explosion. Some grenade types also have a safety clip to prevent the handle from coming off in transit.|$|R
