5|$|On 22 November, Albert <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> Brussels {{with the}} Belgian {{army of the}} Yser in a Joyous Entry. The King was widely {{acclaimed}} by the civilian population. Subsequently, some of the notable activisten from the RVV were put on trial but, although the body had professed as many as 15,000 followers, only 312 individuals were convicted of collaboration with the enemy. Among them was Borms who, from prison, would continue {{to play an important}} role in the Flemish Movement in the 1920s. In total, 40,000 Belgian soldiers and civilians were killed and 77,500 wounded during World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1570, the Sultan of Bijapur, Ali Adil Shah <b>I,</b> <b>entered</b> into an {{alliance}} with the Sultan of Ahmadnagar, Murtaza Nizam Shah, and the Zamorin of Calicut for a simultaneous attack on the Portuguese territories of Goa, Chaul, and Mangalore. He attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur Sultans were especially renowned for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Goan Catholics fled to South Canara during this second wave of migrations, and settled in Barcoor, Kallianpur, Cundapore, and Basroor. For the next century, there was continual migration of Goan Catholics southwards, so that by 1650, {{a considerable number of}} Catholics were settled around Mangalore, Moolki, Shirva, Pezar, Bantval, Cundapore, Kallianpur, and Kirem. The Christian Goud Saraswat Brahmins who came during this wave belonged mostly to the Shenvi subcaste.|$|E

25|$|In 1501, Shah Ismail <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> Tabriz {{and proclaimed}} it {{the capital of}} his Safavid state. In 1514, after the Battle of Chaldiran, Tabriz was {{temporarily}} occupied by the Ottomans. Tabriz retaken by Iranian forces and it remained the capital of Safavid Iranian empire until 1548. In that year Shah Tahmasp I transferred it to Qazvin to avoid the growing threat of Ottoman army to his capital.|$|E

As {{part of the}} RAF's Expansion scheme, orders were placed for 70 Heyford IIIs in 1936, with steam condenser-cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel VI engines. The {{delivery}} of these aircraft allowed the RAF to have nine operational Heyford Squadrons {{by the end of}} 1936.|$|E

25|$|In his mid-twenties in {{the early}} 1960s, he {{switched}} to race walking. Ladany walked his first race in 1962. Commenting on the sport, he reflected:You need {{a certain type of}} mental attitude: a willingness to take punishment, to have a lack of comfort, and pain, to continue and continue. I'm not a psychologist, but was I stubborn, so <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> race walking? Or did I enter race walking, and become stubborn? It's the same in all long-distance events.

25|$|Around 9:30, Drina Division II {{from the}} rear echelon of the First Army arrived {{to the front and}} {{attacked}} the Ottoman centre. Around 11:00, Monastir Infantry Division started to retreat. The commander of VI Corps managed to temporarily halt the Serbian advance by using his last reserves, but in the repeated attack around 13:00, Drina Division I captured Zebrnjak, the main object in Ottoman defense, and forced 17th Infantry Division to retreat. With Üsküb Infantry Division and Monastir Infantry Division already retreating, the battle was resolved. At 15:00, Morava Division <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> Kumanovo.|$|E
25|$|Dmitry <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> history circa 1600, {{after making}} a {{positive}} impression on Patriarch Job of Moscow with his learning and assurance. Upon hearing of this, Tsar Boris Godunov ordered the young man to be seized and examined, whereupon Dmitry fled to Prince Constantine Ostrogski at Ostroh, of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and subsequently entered {{the service of the}} Wisniowieckis, a polonized Ruthenian family. Two family members in particular, the princes Adam and Michał Wiśniowiecki, were intrigued by the stories Dmitry told of whom he purported to be, as it gave the Poles real opportunity to capitalize on the political rancor rising in Moscow.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch East India Company {{defeated}} Portuguese for {{the supremacy}} of spice trade in Malabar in the year CE 1663. Malankara Nazranis used this opportunity to escape from Latin persecution {{with the help of}} Dutch East India Company. The Dutch brought Bishop Gregorios Abdul Jaleel of Jerusalem of Syrian Orthodox Church in their trading vessel in CE 1665. Thomas Arkadyaqon who was consecrated as Mar Thoma <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> into a relationship with the West Syriac Orthodox Church and gradually adopted West Syrian liturgy and practices. The Dutch was on the Malabar Coast from 11 November 1604 - 1795. Mar Thoma I to Mar Thoma VI were the prelates during this period.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|At Ava, the Confederation {{appeared}} unsure how to respond. On one hand, {{they were}} unwilling to launch another full-scale invasion lest they be exposed to another counterattack. On the other hand, they were {{not yet ready to}} cede all of central Burma uncontested. When the dry season of 1544 arrived, they saw no Toungoo armies on the horizon, and ultimately decided on a limited attack across the new ill-defined border. In late 1544, they sent a small army (3000 troops, 300 horses) led by Sithu Kyawhtin I down the Irrawaddy. The Confederation army overran the Toungoo frontier garrisons at the border. At Salin, a senior official loyal to Sithu Kyawhtin I revolted, driving out Sithu Kyawhtin II (Shin Thiha). Sithu Kyawhtin <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> Salin unopposed.|$|E

25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} pupil until his mid teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focussed on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, Saint-Cyr. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the Army, despite being by inclination more suited to {{a career as a}} writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because {{it was one of the}} few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society. He later wrote that “when <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world”, a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the Army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.|$|E

500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E

[...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
