Most masks are painted first {{with a layer of}} white with colors added. Traditionally the <b>decorative</b> <b>paint</b> was oil and enamel, but many have switched to acrylics and other commercial paints. [...] Although details such as beards, mustaches and eyebrows can be painted or sculpted on the mask, more realistic versions add ixtle, cotton, animal hair (such as horse or sheep) and even human hair, as well as other materials. Eyes can be imitated on the mask with the use of marbles, mica, flat or curve glass (painted behind) or glass eyes. Many tiger masks place mirrors for eyes. Teeth can be added with the use of real ones from animals or humans, as well as metal, cactus spines, corn or reeds. If the mask has a tongue, it is often of leather or tin. Horns on devil masks are commonly made from those from cows, goats or deer. Finished masks often receive further decoration with ribbons, gold accents, bells, sequins and more. Often this addition of decoration is done by the dancers themselves to personalize them, especially the addition of beards and fangs. In the town of Teloloapan, Guerrero, the local government holds a contest for the best decoration of devil masks.|$|E

Domestic {{science of}} folk art has {{originated}} and has been developing primarily as a study of archaeological antiquities and artistic monuments of the past. Scientific papers, which comprehended the process of folk art development, began to appear in the late nineteenth century, Archaeological Congresses became the impetus for their appearance.

Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> got the significant boost in its distribution and development when it «came down» from walls to paper. Paper pictures - malyovky - were stucked to walls following the traditional rules of domestic interior’s decoration. Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> got the official status in 1913, when E. Evenbah, by the initiative of D. I. Yavornytsky, gathered the collection of Petrikivsky decorative painting’s malyovkas and organized the exhibition in St. Petersburg. Motives of painting are rooted into the local flora and fauna and into the historical tradition. However, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> is not a direct reflection of natural motifs. World, created in paintings, is the product of the imagination of folk artist, it is the stylization of local flowers, fruits and birds. First names of Masters of Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting,</b> which appeared in historical sources, were T. Pata, N. Bilokin, I. Pavlenko. Their official recognition happened in 1930 after their participation in the first republican exhibition, which was later shown in Kiev, Moscow, Leningrad.

The two-year school of <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> was opened in Petrikivka village in 1936, first teachers there were O. Stativa A. and T. Pata. There are a lot of exhibitions, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> is being introduced abroad. In 1958 F. Panko gathered some masters into the plant of varnished production, which was later modified into the factory of artistic products  «Druzhba». Experimental art studio, organized by him in 1970, was converted into  the center of folk art «Petrykivka» in 1991.  Due to its high decorative properties, Petrikivsky <b>decorative</b> <b>painting</b> blends into the exterior and interior of modern buildings both by walls painting and by the use of paintings and dishes.
