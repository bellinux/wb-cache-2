40|$|Abstract Background Studies of HIV-related risk in trans (transgender, transsexual, or transitioned) {{people have}} most often {{involved}} urban convenience samples {{of those on}} the male-to-female (MTF) spectrum. Studies have detected high prevalences of HIV-related risk behaviours, self-reported HIV, and HIV seropositivity. Methods The Trans PULSE Project conducted a multi-mode survey using respondent-driven sampling to recruit 433 trans people in Ontario, Canada. Weighted estimates were calculated for HIV-related risk behaviours, HIV testing and self-reported HIV, including subgroup estimates for gender spectrum and ethno-racial groups. Results Trans people in Ontario report a wide range of sexual behaviours with a full range of partner types. High proportions – 25 % of female-to-male (FTM) and 51 % of MTF individuals – had not had a sex partner within the past year. Of MTFs, 19 % had a past-year high-risk sexual experience, versus 7 % of FTMs. The largest behavioural contributors to HIV risk were sexual behaviours some may assume trans people do not engage in: unprotected receptive genital sex for FTMs and insertive genital sex for MTFs. Overall, 46 % had never been tested for HIV; lifetime testing was highest in Aboriginal trans people and lowest among non-Aboriginal racialized people. Approximately 15 % of both FTM and MTF participants had engaged in sex work or exchange sex and about 2 % currently work in the sex trade. Self-report of HIV prevalence was 10 times the estimated baseline prevalence for Ontario. However, given wide confidence intervals and the high proportion of trans people who had never been tested for HIV, estimating the actual prevalence was not possible. Conclusions Results suggest potentially higher than baseline levels of HIV; however low testing rates were observed and self-reported prevalences likely underestimate seroprevalence. Explicit inclusion of trans people in <b>epidemiological</b> surveillance <b>statistics</b> would provide much-needed information on incidence and prevalence. Given the wide range of sexual behaviours and partner types reported, HIV prevention programs and materials should not make assumptions regarding types of behaviours trans people do or do not engage in. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rates of {{diseases}} and injuries {{and the effects}} of their risk factors can have substantial subnational heterogeneity, especially in middle-income countries like Mexico. Subnational analysis of the burden {{of diseases}}, injuries, and risk factors can improve characterization of the epidemiological transition and identify policy priorities. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated deaths and loss of healthy life years (measured in disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) in 2004 from a comprehensive list of diseases and injuries, and 16 major risk factors, by sex and age for Mexico and its states. Data sources included the vital statistics, national censuses, health examination surveys, and published <b>epidemiological</b> studies. Mortality <b>statistics</b> were adjusted for underreporting, misreporting of age at death, and for misclassification and incomparability of cause-of-death assignment. Nationally, noncommunicable diseases caused 75 % of total deaths and 68 % of total DALYs, with another 14 % of deaths and 18 % of DALYs caused by undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases. The leading causes of death were ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and road traffic injuries. High body mass index, high blood glucose, and alcohol use were the leading risk factors for disease burden, causing 5. 1 %, 5. 0 %, and 7. 3 % of total burden of disease, respectively. Mexico City had the lowest mortality rates (4. 2 per 1, 000) and the Southern region the highest (5. 0 per 1, 000); under-five mortality in the Southern region was nearly twice that of Mexico City. In the Southern region undernutrition and communicable, maternal, and perinatal diseases caused 23 % of DALYs; in Chiapas, they caused 29 % of DALYs. At the same time, the absolute rates of noncommunicable disease and injury burdens were highest in the Southern region (105 DALYs per 1, 000 population versus 97 nationally for noncommunicable diseases; 22 versus 19 for injuries). CONCLUSIONS: Mexico is at an advanced stage in the epidemiologic transition, with the majority of the disease and injury burden from noncommunicable diseases. A unique characteristic of the epidemiological transition in Mexico is that overweight and obesity, high blood glucose, and alcohol use are responsible for larger burden of disease than other noncommunicable disease risks such as tobacco smoking. The Southern region is least advanced in the epidemiological transition and suffers from the largest burden of ill health in all disease and injury groups...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish {{municipalities}} {{are important}} actors that offer appropriate environments for healthpromoting activities directed at children and adolescents. Enhanced understanding on how such activities develop {{is needed to}} improve local public health action. The overall objective of this thesis was to describe potential explanatory factors in municipal health-promoting measures directed at children and adolescents, {{in order to facilitate}} for national actors to support healthpromoting action in the municipalities. In the first three papers of this thesis the intentions of 25 Swedish municipalities to promote children and adolescents' health are described. Safety promotion (Study I), health promotion in preschools (Study II) and health promotion in schools (Study III) were of primary interest. In the next step policy processes and factors that might explain municipal public health action were analysed (Study IV). Finally, data from Study 1 were used to test correlations between municipal safety-promoting activities and health outcome (Study V). Although intentions to promote children's health were in general quite well developed, there were some exceptions and variations among the municipalities. Significant correlations between municipal healthpromoting activities and outcome variables were revealed on injuries (Study V) but not on youth behaviour (Study III). Municipal socio-economic status, measured as proportion adults with more than 12 years of education, did not predict the level of healthpromoting measures, whereas municipal growth seemed to have a hampering effect. These results were consistently observed in Studies I-III. Faster growing municipalities reported fewer safety-promoting measures, a lower fraction of preschool staff with a university degree and a lower fraction of full-time employed teachers with a university degree than slower growing municipalities. Five potential explanatory factors for policy process development were identified in Study IV: financial problems, perceived local needs, external funding, national and international policy documents and presence of a local public health sector. Politicians, public officials and nongovernmental organisations were important actors in different phases of the policy process, with strong commitment, professional skills and powerful position in the organisation as main characteristics. The health sector in general, <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> and evidence-based methods were seldom mentioned in Study IV. Potential policy implications based on the results presented in this thesis are that disseminating public health-related knowledge through international and national policy documents and supporting institutionalisation of a local public health sector might be useful methods to stimulate and support municipal public health action. Further, means to introduce and distribute <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> and evidence-based methods to the municipalities ought to be considered. Increased and improved cooperation between public health sciences and political sciences (e. g., by integrated courses and shared research projects) could be helpful in developing public health research within the municipal arena...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are Gram-negative, microaerophilic {{bacteria}} {{which are}} worldwide in distribution, causing a zoonotic disease in humans called campylobacteriosis. These infections are {{mainly caused by}} eating contaminated food products, most often improperly prepared poultry meat. Campylobacteriosis usually {{takes the form of}} gastroenteritis, or inflammation of the intestines, and the characteristic symptoms are watery-mucous diarrhea often with the presence of blood in stool, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. The epidemiological data suggest that in Europe, as well as in North America, bacteria of the genus Campylobacter, especially C. jejuni and C. coli, are the most commonly isolated pathogens in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Epidemiological data indicate that these organisms are a much more common cause of acute diarrhea, mostly in young children, than Salmonella and Yersinia. The lack of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of campylobacteriosis necessary to carry out specialized microbiological diagnostics.

30|$|Clinical {{diagnosis}} {{is the most}} widely applied and reliable method for drawing conclusions about the patient’s malarial status (Blobel et al. 2013). It is often the only feasible approach in many circumstances, such as in rural and areas of high prevalence where patients {{may be willing to}} incur treatment costs, but are unable to pay for charges related to diagnosis (Danyliv et al. 2013; Hypponen et al. 2013; Raknes et al. 2013). This approach is inexpensive to perform and requires no specialized equipment (Epstein and Blumenfield 2001). In Uganda, a number of ongoing computer based initiatives aimed at strengthening existing health care systems at the Health facility levels have been undertaken in recent years (Wesonga et al. 2015). These initiatives include systems such as the Code 8 (Fallon 2013) and other UNICEF initiatives such as MobileVRS, DevTrac, mHealth, mTRAC, HMIS. However, all these systems are basically disease surveillance innovations and hence still lacking as far as online clinical based medical diagnosis and inference is concerned. Save for the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> and stocktaking, the current systems lack statistical modules such as predictive models and goodness of fit to generate necessary and timely statistics to address the knowledge gaps and challenges in the existing systems. Above all, malaria is dynamic with symptoms varying from one patient to another and can be sometimes difficult to distinguish from other diseases including typhoid and hypertension (Guwatudde et al. 2015).|$|E

Fifty semi-structured interviews and written documentation gathered from three municipalities in Stockholm County resulted in nine case studies. A policy process matrix, based on the actor-structural approach, was constructed to categorise the data. Five aspects contributing to the trajectory of municipal health-promoting measures aimed at children and adolescents were often mentioned in the data set. These are financial problems, perceived local needs, access to external funding, statements in national and international policy documents and the presence of a local public health sector.

40|$|Introduction: Intussusception {{in adult}} is rarely caused by {{idiopathic}} conditions. Main causes are inflammatory diseases, benign or malignant tumors and motility disorders. As a benign cause, lipomas {{appear as a}} particularly rare gastrointestinal intraluminal tumor occurring with highest incidence in the colon, mostly in the caecum and ascending colon. Presentation of case: A 57 -year-old male patient was admitted at the surgical emergency in Belo Horizonte, with history of chronic and intermittent diffuse abdominal pain, associated with variations of his bowel habits and rare episodes of vomiting starting around 3  days prior to admission. Discussion: Intussusception {{is the cause of}} adult symptomatic bowel obstruction in 1 % of the cases and its colocolonic occurrence represents 17 % of all intestinal intussusceptions in adults. The reported case presents itself as even rarer considering its evaluation according to the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> of 1 : 5 men/women ratio and lipoma’s most common location being the right colon. Intussusception and intestinal obstructions caused by intraluminal lipomas are not often described in the literature and its occurrence is directly related to its size, usually larger than 2  cm diameter. The management of lipomatous intraluminal lesions of the colon is traditionally surgical, and it allows a selective resection, {{depending on the size of}} the tumor, length of intussusception, and the amount of inflammation. Conclusion: Patients with chronic abdominal symptoms and semi-obstruction caused by intussusception are rarely diagnosed before surgery unless there is a high index of suspicion.

40|$|Epidemiology is {{the study}} of {{patterns}} of health-related states or events in populations. Statistical models developed for epidemiology could be usefully applied to behavioral states or events. The aim {{of this study is to}} present the application of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> to understand animal behavior where discrete outcomes are of interest, using data from guide dogs to illustrate. Specifically, survival analysis and multistate modeling are applied to data on guide dogs comparing dogs that completed training and qualified as a guide dog, to those that were withdrawn from the training program. Survival analysis allows the time to (or between) a binary event(s) and the probability of the event occurring at or beyond a specified time point. Survival analysis, using a Cox proportional hazards model, was used to examine the time taken to withdraw a dog from training. Sex, breed, and other factors affected time to withdrawal. Bitches were withdrawn faster than dogs, Labradors were withdrawn faster, and Labrador × Golden Retrievers slower, than Golden Retriever × Labradors; and dogs not bred by Guide Dogs were withdrawn faster than those bred by Guide Dogs. Multistate modeling (MSM) can be used as an extension of survival analysis to incorporate more than two discrete events or states. Multistate models were used to investigate transitions between states of training to qualification as a guide dog or behavioral withdrawal, and from qualification as a guide dog to behavioral withdrawal. Sex, breed (with purebred Labradors and Golden retrievers differing from F 1 crosses), and bred by Guide Dogs or not, effected movements between states.

40|$|The {{following}} research brief uses {{data obtained from}} twenty six (n= 26) interviews with emergency managers, National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters, and amateur radio operators (HAM) to determine whether rainfall estimation or tornado detection would more effectively {{address the needs of}} the emergency management community in Oklahoma. This study was conducted {{as part of a broader}} project on end-user integration, which intends to incorporate the needs and recommendations of end users into the design of radar technology currently under development by the Engineering Center for the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA). In the course of our analysis, we discovered that a majority of emergency managers require tornado detection due to the specific needs of Oklahoma communities, as well as their experiences with severe weather. We identified three reasons for this decision. First, tornados are less predictable than floods. Second, mitigation strategies, such as rain gauges and retention ponds, have significantly reduced the threat of flooding in most regions. Finally, failed tornado warnings vis-a-vis flood warnings seem to pose a greater threat to professional credibility and legitimacy. Overall, these findings indicate that emergency managers consider a wide range of factors when making decisions related to severe weather. While much is revealed about the decision-making process, the reasons for which emergency managers chose tornado detection over rainfall estimation were, in some cases, based on incomplete or inaccurate information. Most strikingly, for example, is that according to <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics,</b> flooding appears to be a greater threat to life than tornados. Moreover, current flood mitigation practices do not address the fact that a) floods produce long-term and diffuse effects (e. g. insurance costs), and b) mitigation techniques may decrease the level of individual preparedness, putting a population at risk of flash and/or major flooding. It is the recommendation of emergency managers that radar resources should primarily be allocated to tornado detection. It should, however, be remembered that flooding may continue to constitute a major threat to these communities...|$|E

S. legal system and noting the importance of the Rule of Law, we review the historical development and current status of the relevant laws, provide some basic <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics,</b> and refer to some of the considerable body of extant em-pirical research in the field. Preventing behavior perceived as "dangerous " or "harmful " is a fun-damental concern of all societies and one that all governments pursue in earnest. While the imposition of the criminal sanction is the principal method used by most societies to limit and control the occurrence of harmful acts, a variety of educa-tional, health, mental health, and welfare laws are also brought to bear (e. g., Cummings 1968). In this arti-cle, we discuss the experience of one country—the United States of America—in using one means-mental health law—to prevent and control dangerous behavior. We first provide a background for non-American readers in the tradi-tional justifications in American law for coercively imposing measures of social control of any sort, and pre-sent a brief overview of recent trends in mental health law. We then distinguish civil commitment (the in-voluntary mental hospitalization of those not charged with criminal con-duct) from criminal commitment (the involuntary mental hospitalization of those who are charged with violating criminal statutes), and in each of these two areas address three topics: (1) the historical development of the law; (2) the law as it currently exists; and (3) the most recent epidemiological statis-tics. Due to limitations of space, the commitment of children, the devel-opmentally disabled, alcoholics, and persons addicted to drugs will not be considered.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoporosis is a {{systemic}} skeletal disorder, characterized by reduced bone mass, deterioration of bone structure, increased bone fragility, and increased fracture risk. It is more frequent to find among {{women than men}} at a 4 : 1 ratio. Evidence suggests that to adopt changes on some life habits can prevent or delay development of osteoporosis. Several osteoporosis-risk factors have been confirmed in the US and western Europe, but in El Salvador there are neither reliable <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> about this skeletal disorder nor studies addressing osteoporosis-risk factors in women. The {{aim of this study}} was to determinate the extent of osteoporosis knowledge, the levels of both daily calcium intake and weight-bearing physical activity, and the influence of several osteoporosis-risk factors on these variables in three age groups of Salvadorean women. Methods In this exploratory cross-sectional study, an osteoporosis knowledge assessment questionnaire incluiding a food frequency and a physical activity record section were used to collect data and it was delivered through a face-to-face interview. A convenience sample (n = 197) comprised of three groups of women aged 25 – 35 years, 36 – 49 years, and over 49 years was taken. Among-group comparisons of means were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. To determinate the overall influence of osteoporosis-risk factors, the multivariate analysis was used. Results Study results indicated that better educated women had more knowledge about osteoporosis than women with a low education level, regardless of age, even though this knowledge was rather fair. Older women got more weight-bearing physical activity at home and less at place of employment than reported by the younger women; however, neither group performed sufficient high-intensity WBPA to improve bone mass. Regardless of age, the most women consumed 60 % or less than the Dietary Reference Intake of calcium and depend on household income, lactose intolerance and coffee rather than milk consumption. Conclusion In summary, the majority of women in this study have modest knowledge on osteoporosis. The knowledge base is not linked to preventive health habits, including sufficient calcium intake and performance of weight-bearing physical activities. They are thus at increased risk for low bone mass. </p...|$|E

My research, conducted at a local spatial scale in Ithaca, NY complements analyses using House Finch Disease Survey data (Dhondt et al. 1998) at a broader spatial scale, and provides a point of entry for understanding the critical linkage of scale dependent processes influencing finch-MG dynamics. Throughout this dissertation, I have sought to characterize the structure of this local finch population, and establish how both host population structure and movements lead to a better overall understanding of MG infection dynamics. As such, the complete body of work produced here represents the most comprehensive investigation of wildlife disease dynamics to date, which has incorporated and accounted for sampling and biologically driven heterogeneity in host encounter probabilities. Beyond the proximate benefits that this research contributes to understanding of the finch-MG system, my hope is that this work will in part serve as a precedent for future empirical investigations of wildlife-pathogen dynamics.

40|$|Influenza A viruses {{have caused}} several devastating {{outbreaks}} in poultry with some zoonotic infections and deaths in humans. To control the viruses and their continuous circulation in poultry population, {{an understanding of}} the epidemiology of the viruses is needed. An evaluation of the situation of avian influenza A H 5 N 1 in two African countries most affected by this virus was conducted. To that end, two aims were pursued: (i) to identify the factors that played important roles in the dissemination and circulation of the virus, and (ii) to explore the potentials of the virus from becoming endemic in the poultry populations in Africa. The analyses partly described the extent of H 5 N 1 outbreaks in Nigeria in at-risk and non-infected premises and live bird markets in the country. All samples (tracheal and cloacal swabs, parenchymatous tissues and sera) were analysed using virus isolation, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology. Primary data on influenza A H 5 N 1 in human as recorded by the Egyptian government was collected and analysed using different variables and risk factors for HPAI H 5 N 1 virus infection in poultry farms in Nigeria during 2006 - 2007 outbreaks in Nigeria were explored using the conditional logistic regression models. Factors that supported infections in new premises included: receiving visitors on farm premises, purchase of live poultry/products, farm workers that live outside the premises. Because biosecurity is important to reduce risks of infection in poultry farms, the effects and costs associated with the implementation or neglect of biosecurity, as well as the feasibility of implementation in the household poultry in Egypt were evaluated. Risks of particular importance for the household poultry were categorised into people-related, environmental-related and other birds/animal-related risks. Biosecurity measures were compatible in the household poultry and it is 8. 45 times better to implement biosecurity than to do nothing against HPAI H 5 N 1. The financial risk analysis was robust and withstood sensitivity analysis. The change that may occur {{in the course of the}} household poultry project was accommodated profitably. The effect of road network and its contributions to the epidemics in Nigeria were evaluated to determine whether HPAI H 5 N 1 exhibit properties of network theory. Spatial aggregation of cases (disease clusters), links among similar ‘nodes’ (assortativity), simultaneous activation of similar nodes (synchronicity), epidemic flows moving from highly to poorly connected nodes (directionality), and a Pareto analyses pattern were observed including synchronicity and directionality of spread properties. An exploratory analysis was conducted on the probability of human infection through the oral contacts with A-H 5 N 1 contaminated meat. Detailed quantitative risk assessment using predictive microbiology-process risk model revealed that up to 15, 159 humans may have contracted HPAI H 5 N 1 in Africa, with 1, 964 deaths. These figures are higher than those officially reported. The model has limitations but bias associated with official <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> which are often prone to underreporting, lack of awareness especially in the rural communities and censoring effects may also account for this discrepancy. Finally, continuous monitoring of influenza viruses in Africa and implementation of measures that should reduce the burden of infection in Africa is necessary...|$|E

Dire circumstances such as homelessness place youth at a disadvantage for attaining mastery of developmental transitions compared to their housed peers. Resilience has been defined as the maintenance of positive adaptation despite adversity. Developmentally, resilience is understood as age-appropriate functioning concurrent with vulnerability related to the adversity that might otherwise place the young person at risk for less positive adaptation. Ecological Systems Theory examines not only the most immediate aspects of youths' social context, such as social support, but also broader factors, such as resource-intensity of communities. Ecological Systems Theory considers linkages between the different levels comprising youth's social ecology. This framework is useful for understanding resilient outcomes in homeless youth because their social contexts are less insulated and protected, and are subject to differing influences than housed youth living in a traditional family unit. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and test Ecological Resilience Prediction Models of outcomes in N = 157 youth who were homeless in October 2002 to October 2003, and N = 99 youth who were re-interviewed between March 2004 to October 2005. The current study and its participants are part of the larger Panel Study on Homelessness in Ottawa (Aubry, Klodawsky, Hay & Birnie 2003). The Panel Study was undertaken to understand pathways into and out of homelessness across purposively sampled subgroups of homeless individuals. The three resilient outcomes predicted by Ecological Resilience Prediction Models within the dissertation were becoming re-housed, returning to school, and joining the work force. Secondary analyses were conducted amongst 17 youth who had become parents between Time 1 and Time 2 interview, whose data were considered separately {{from the rest of the}} sample. Results indicated that the single predictor of becoming re-housed was shorter lifetime durations of homelessness. Female sex and re-housing (for 90 days or longer), best predicted return to school. Factors predicting employment were complex, but consistent with working long hours while attending high school in studies conducted on housed youth with respect to cumulative stress. Greater Time 1 substance use and increased size of social networks predicted employment stability at Time 2. Diminished mental health functioning and greater duration of rehousing at Time 2 were additional predictors of employment at Time 2. Although employment was associated with benefits such as re-housing and decreased alcohol use at Time 2, it was associated with reduced mental health at follow-up. Policy and research recommendations emerged from examining each resilient outcome ecologically. The United States has specific educational legislation for homeless youth (the McKenny-Vento Act), a national data system to track <b>epidemiological</b> <b>statistics</b> on homeless youth (NEO-RHYMIS), and re-housing interventions for homeless adults, the implementation of which is supported in an adolescent population based on results of this dissertation (Housing First). Future research is needed to identify methods of feasibly implementing protective education, supportive employment and immediate housing for homeless youth in Canada...|$|E
