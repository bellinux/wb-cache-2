40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the decision a purchaser must make regarding the number of suppliers that should be invited {{to submit a tender}} for a certain purchase. On the one hand, the costs of sending invitations to <b>tender,</b> <b>the</b> costs of <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>tenders</b> received, and <b>the</b> costs of communicating the outcome to the suppliers that were not selected, all increase with the number of suppliers that are invited to <b>tender.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, with every additional <b>tender,</b> <b>the</b> purchaser might obtain a better bid. We present a theoretical decision model, <b>the</b> Economic <b>Tender</b> Quantity (ETQ) model, that under certain conditions may assist the purchaser in finding the number of tenderers that minimises the expected total costs of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> process, that is the sum of the expected costs of sending, evaluating and communicating, and the expected bid price. We discuss these conditions and possible extensions, as well as future research opportunities in this area...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. The {{advent of}} large {{multidisciplinary}} projects has necessitated an in-depth evaluation of tenders {{to ensure that}} <b>the</b> <b>tenderer</b> awarded <b>the</b> contract has submitted <b>the</b> lowest acceptable <b>evaluated</b> <b>tender</b> sum and has convinced the evaluation team that, by adequate resourcing and programming, he has appreciated the technical implications. The objectives of this thesis were threefold: * to discuss {{the need for a}} new approach to tender evaluation; * to propose amendments to <b>the</b> traditional <b>tender</b> document to provide a basis for a detailed tender evaluation; and * to propose methods of <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> information received from the tenderers so that <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> most suitable from both financial and technical considerations is recommended to the client. An extensive literature survey revealed little relevant reference material and, as a result, the author's experience in <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>tenders,</b> together with input from engineers knowledgeable in this field, has formed the basis of this thesis. To obtain the information necessary for the evaluation phase, <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> document must be so structured as to provide <b>the</b> <b>tenderer</b> with sufficient detail to adequately assess the complexity of the project and to provide the evaluation team with sufficient pertinent information to adequately <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of building {{is important to}} ensure that the life span of the buildings is lengthened. Most of the building maintenance works are carried out by contractors through quotation works. The selection of good contractors is important to ensure the successful completion of the project. The evaluation and selection of the contractors are usually carried out in three stages. The first stage is to check all relevant documents submitted by the contractors, the second stage is to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> technical and financial capabilities of the contractors and the final stage is to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> price. However, <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> price is <b>evaluated</b> either by <b>the</b> comparison of price quoted to the department estimate method or the evaluation of the price quoted by cut-off method. The aim {{of this study is to}} <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> performance of the contractors selected through the ‘cut-off’ method and the ‘comparison against office estimate’ method and to identify the method preferred by the contractors. The objectives of the study are to study the quotation evaluation process in the selection of contractors for building maintenance work, to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> performance of contractor selected through comparison of quoted price to the department estimate method, to assess the performance of contractor selected through the evaluation of the quoted price by cut-off method and to identify the method preferred by <b>the</b> contractor in <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> price. <b>The</b> scope of this study is conducted at JKR Daerah Johor Bahru. The study is carried out by interviews, questionnaires and through records checking at the JKR’s office. A total of 100 questionnaires were distributed and 50 questionnaires were returned duly answered. The data is analyzed using Average Index. From the study, the evaluation process for contractors executing minor works comprises of 3 stages namely; Stage 1, checking all documents submitted by the contractors, Stage 2 : analyzing the technical and financial status of contractors and stage 3 : analyzing <b>the</b> contractors’ <b>tender</b> amount. <b>The</b> performance of contractor selected through comparison of price quoted to the department estimate method are the contractor is able to complete the job as stated in the contract and there is an increase in construction cost. The performance of contractor selected through the evaluation of the quoted price by cut-off method are increase in construction cost and the contractors applied for extension of time. Only 68 % of the contractors preferred the evaluation of the quoted price by cut-off method. Among the reasons given are it gives more confidence to the contractors and the selection criteria is clear and transparent...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of emerging black entrepreneurs on their ability to access government contract work with special reference to that outsourced by the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal. The study was based on the assumption that black emerging entrepreneurs are side lined by the procurement systems and processes of government, despite the fact when the new government took over after the democratic elections of 1994, it formulated legislation and policies and provided institutional framework to ensure that enterprises belonging to entrepreneurs of African descent in particular were brought into the economic mainstream activities of the country. The study utilized an exploratory description research design owing to publicity of literature on the effectiveness of government's procurement intervention strategies in addressing the needs of emerging black entrepreneurs. The study used two samples drawn from two research populations. In the first sample the population consisted of thirty-two tender submissions that emerging black entrepreneurs forwarded to the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal, in response to contract work or tenders advertised and <b>evaluated</b> by <b>the</b> <b>Tender</b> Evaluation Committee and <b>the</b> <b>Tender</b> Award Committee of the Department during the financial year 2001 / 2. An instrument was developed to elicit data from <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> documents for <b>the</b> purpose of orders. In the second sample the research population consisted of sixteen emerging black entrepreneurs whose tender documents submitted in response to <b>the</b> <b>tenders</b> outsourced by <b>the</b> Department during the financial year 2001 / 2 were <b>evaluated</b> by <b>the</b> Department's <b>Tender</b> Evaluation Committee and tender Award Committee during the period in question. The questionnaire was used to elicit information on the perceptions of emerging black entrepreneurs with regard to their level of participation in the procurement process of the Department. The findings of the study are supportive of the guiding questions and assumptions advanced for the purpose of focusing the study. The finding was that black emerging entrepreneurs perceived themselves to be non-participants in the procurement activities of the Department. The study also found the existence of structural problem, which acted as barriers to active participation, of black emerging entrepreneurs, in the outsourcing activities of the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal...|$|R
40|$|The issue solved in {{this thesis}} is the {{procedure}} for the award of public contract, which is explored {{from the perspective of the}} Act No. 137 / 3006 Coll., on Public Contracts, as Amended. With the help of latest Amendment No. 55 / 2012 Coll., number of changes was allocated into the tables. These changes fundamentally modify the view on the Act of Public Contract. Process of the award of public contract is then analyzed and <b>evaluated</b> by <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> dossier, from which the data about qualification requirements and evaluation criteria was drawn. Evaluation is performed using graphs and tables. The result of this thesis is to demonstrate a significant effect of the Amendment on the entire procedure and the decrease of assigned public works contracts with regard to public supply contracts and public service contracts. Future recommendation is to re-amend the Act on Public Contract and try to allow the re-growth of awarded public contracts, and to reclaim significant negative impact of the Amendment...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{industry}} is a huge and big industry. The industry involved so many works; so many trade, workers, material, contract document and so many things. The contract document usually is from the (Request for Proposal) that submitted by <b>the</b> <b>tenderer</b> that then be <b>evaluated</b> by <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> committee. If <b>the</b> entire requirement is fulfilled, the Request for Proposal is usually converted to the Agreement of Contract or Contract Document or called Condition of Contract. The Condition of Contract may be altered by the client to suit <b>the</b> price <b>tendered</b> by contractor. There will be some terms added by the client to make the Condition of Contract clearer and understandable. One of the terms is mutual termination agreement. Most of time, the mutual termination clause is like a silent in a Condition of Contract. Nobody bother about it. There are no mutual termination clause in PWD 203 A (2010), PAM (2006), CIDB (2000) etc. Surat Pekeliling Perbendaharaan (SPP) Bil. 3 Tahun 2008 Pelaksanaan Syarat Perubahan Harga Di Dalam Kontrak Kerja was issue that suits the situation for increment in price for that year.

40|$|Following {{a period}} of rising costs, {{competitive}} tendering {{was introduced to the}} London bus industry in 1984. This thesis is an economic analysis of <b>the</b> impact of <b>tendering</b> on London bus services. Chapter 1 states the aims and objectives of the thesis {{in the context of the}} economics literature. The chapter is divided into two sections. In section 1 the literature is drawn upon to provide an economic interpretation of the state of the London bus industry prior to <b>the</b> introduction of <b>tendering,</b> and to provide an economic context for <b>the</b> introduction of <b>tendering.</b> In section 2 literature relating to the design of a tendering process is summarised. The focus is on the auction aspect of <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> process and some important dimensions of contract specification. <b>The</b> impact of <b>tendering</b> on costs is analysed in chapter 2. Three questions are asked: What is the cost structure of the competitive London bus industry. Is there any evidence of strategic bidding behaviour as predicted by the auction theory literature. What level of cost saving can be attributed to <b>tendering.</b> <b>The</b> analysis is based on the full set of bid data from London bus <b>tendering</b> over <b>the</b> period 1985 - 1993 and is econometric in nature. The results are: there is no statistically significant difference in costs of operation between public and private sector operators under competition; bidding behaviour conforms to some features predicted by theoretical models; the estimated cost saving from tendering is 20 %. Chapter 3 <b>evaluates</b> <b>the</b> impact of <b>tendering</b> on <b>the</b> demand for bus travel in London. The relationship between demand and service quality is estimated, gains to tendering are attributed in accordance with the increased service quality due to tendering. A statistically significant relationship between demand and service quality is found. The lowest estimate of revenue gained due to tendering is 9. 6 million over the period 1987 - 1992 in 1992 prices. Chapter 4 estimates the welfare gain due to <b>tendering,</b> defined as <b>the</b> sum of changes in producer and consumer surplus due to <b>tendering.</b> <b>The</b> estimated welfare gain due to tendering is between 90 and 380 million over the period 1987 - 1992 in 1992 prices. An appendix to this chapter analyses the relationship between welfare and the type of contract upon which tendering is based. It is argued that a cost contract is preferable to a bottom line contract. Chapter 5 is based on an in depth series of interviews with key actors in the London bus industry. The aim here was to find out things that cannot be inferred from the data. Areas discussed include: the extent to which tendering as opposed to other factors led to change in the London bus industry; the source of cost savings; <b>the</b> impact of <b>tendering</b> on Labour; problems associated with tendering. Interviews suggested that: cost savings stemmed from wage reductions and productivity gains; there are some problems with the bidding process; there is a tension between bus planners and some bus company managers. In certain cases <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> authority offered contract for tender in bundles. Chapter 6 analyses this policy from theoretical and empirical perspectives and asks was it optimal for <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> authority. It is concluded that the policy should not be used by London Transport. Finally, in chapter 7, an overall assessment of <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> process is presented. The focus is on results and policy implications for bus tendering in London and competitive tendering in general...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of winning <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> {{is subject to}} the cost estimation proposed by the contractors compared to the cost estimation prepared by the client’s representative.

40|$|The paper models {{fixed rate}} tenders, where {{a central bank}} offers to lend central bank funds to {{financial}} institutions.

We examine how the design of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> affects equilibrium bidding behavior and the incidence of short squeezes. Important elements in the analysis include the type of policy implemented by the central bank as well as bidders' initial endowments of liquidity and collateral. Three instruments for softening short squeezes are identified: <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> rate, <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> sizes, and admissible collateral. Increasing <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> rate or size tends to decrease the probability and severity of a short squeeze.
