5|$|By July 1990 the {{government}} began to distribute weapons to civilians <b>in</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>to</b> Krahn and Mandingo who wished to protect themselves.

A '1990 soldier' which the President had personally picked, Tailey Yonbu, led a massacre of refugees, mostly Gio and Mandingo civilians, {{on the night of}} July 29/30, 1990 at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Sinkor, Monrovia. Some 600 were killed. Because of the previous ethnic purges carried out by Doe's forces, the conflict took on characteristics of an ethnic pogrom.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> a command-and-control server, {{and used to}} encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1538 James V {{summoned the}} 3rd Earl of Morton before the Privy Council, {{accusing him of}} non-payment of his feudal dues, and in 1540 he banished the Earl to Inverness. Morton reached Brechin, in Angus, where he signed a deed resigning his lands to his kinsman Robert Douglas of Lochleven. Lochleven was {{compelled}} to resign the lands <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> James V, although he was permitted to keep Aberdour Castle. After James V's death in late 1542, George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Arran assisted Morton in reclaiming his lands, including Aberdour. In return their sons were to marry two of Morton's three daughters. Pittendreich's son James (1525-1581) married the heiress, Elizabeth, and succeeded, in 1553, as 4th Earl of Morton.|$|E

5|$|The Viking {{invasions of}} the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North-East England, leading <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> another wave of conversion. Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs {{were very similar}} to other Germanic groups, with a pantheon of gods {{including}} Odin, Thor and Ullr, combined with a belief in a final, apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok. The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly, assimilating their beliefs into Christianity in the decades following the occupation of York, which the Archbishop had survived. The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England's leading Churchmen {{to negotiate with the}} warlords. As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert, many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England to assist in the process.|$|E

French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon.

5|$|The barony of Aberdour was {{acquired}} in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on {{his marriage to}} Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont. Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200, or possibly even earlier. In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey. There is no record {{of what happened to}} the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King Robert the Bruce granted Aberdour to his kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332). Moray's grandson granted the barony <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale (c. 1300-1353), in 1342.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the Commonwealth Government retains some influence through the National Capital Authority.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{book of the}} Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, celebrates the monastery at Ely and focuses on Æthelthryth's piety and the translation of her relics. Bede does not mention the matrilinear succession established at Ely by Æthelthryth, where power passed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Seaxburh before subsequently transferring to Seaxburh's daughter Eormenhild and to her granddaughter, Werburh. He praises the virtues of Æthelthryth, a princess who was married twice but still preserved her virginity. Seaxburh receives little praise from Bede, as she had borne children before becoming a nun. He only mentions Seaxburh's marriage to Eorcenberht, succession as abbess and translation of her sister's relics.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Framlingham in Suffolk rose sharply after the Norman invasion of England as the village {{turned into a}} small town of at least 600 inhabitants, surrounded by valuable lands {{in one of the}} most prosperous parts of the country. The region was owned by the powerful Hugh d'Avranches, the Earl of Chester, who granted it <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> Roger Bigod, the Sheriff of Suffolk. A ringwork or motte and bailey castle was first built in either the 11th or early 12th century in the northern half of the Inner Court of the current castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
5|$|Authors of the 12th and 13th centuries such as Joseph of Exeter and Albert of Stade {{continued}} {{to tell the}} legend of the Trojan War in Latin in a form that follows Dares' tale with Troilus remaining {{one of the most important}} warriors on the Trojan side. However, it was two of their contemporaries, Benoît de Sainte-Maure in his French verse romance and Guido delle Colonne in his Latin prose history, both also admirers of Dares, who were to define the tale of Troy for the remainder of the medieval period. The details of their narrative of the war were copied, for example, in the Troy Books of Laud and Lydgate and also Raoul Lefevre's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Lefevre, through Caxton's 1474 printed translation, was <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> become the best known retelling of the Troy story in Renaissance England and influenced Shakespeare among others. The story of Troilus as a lover, invented by Benoît and retold by Guido, generated a second line of influence. It was taken up as a tale that could be told in its own right by Boccaccio and then by Chaucer who established a tradition of retelling and elaborating the story in English-language literature, which was to be followed by Henryson and Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Farleigh Hungerford Castle {{slipped into}} decline. In 1702, the castle was sold on to Hector Cooper, {{who lived in}} Trowbridge; in 1730 it was passed <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the Houlton family, who had {{purchased}} the estates surrounding the castle. The Houlton family broke up castle's stone walls and the internal contents for salvage. Some of the parts, such as the marble floors, were reused at Longleat or in the Houlton's new house, Farleigh House, built nearby in the 1730s; other elements were reused by local villagers. By {{the end of the}} 1730s the castle was ruinous and, although the castle chapel was repaired and brought back into use in 1779, the north-west and north-east towers had both collapsed by the end of 1797. The outer court became a farm yard, with the priest's house becoming the farm house. The castle's park was reassigned to serve Farleigh House instead.|$|E
5|$|Stuart painted George Washington in {{a series}} of iconic portraits, each of them leading <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> a demand for copies, and keeping Stuart busy and highly paid for years. The most famous and celebrated of these likenesses is known as The Athenaeum and is {{currently}} portrayed on the United States one dollar bill. Stuart, along with his daughters, painted a total of 130 reproductions of The Athenaeum. However, he never completed the original version; after finishing Washington's face, he kept the original version to make the copies. He sold up to 70 of his reproductions for a price of US$100 each, but the original portrait was left unfinished at the time of Stuart's death in 1828. The painting was jointly purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1980, and was on display in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. in late 2014.|$|E
