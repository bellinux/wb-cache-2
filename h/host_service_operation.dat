40|$|Abstract The {{trend toward}} media content hosting is seeing a {{significant}} growth as more rich media {{is used in}} the enterprise environment and as it becomes mission critical for businesses. A shared media <b>hosting</b> <b>service</b> supports the illusion that each <b>hosted</b> <b>service</b> has its own media server, when, in reality, multiple “logical hosts” may share one physical host. For such a shared media <b>hosting</b> <b>service,</b> the ability to guarantee a specified share of server resources to a particular <b>hosted</b> <b>service</b> is very important. We present SharedMediaGuard- a shared media hosting infrastructure that can efficiently allocate the predefined shares of server resources to the <b>hosted</b> media <b>services.</b> The proposed solution is based on a unified cost function that uses a single value to reflect the combined resource requirement such as CPU, bandwidth and memory necessary to support a particular media stream depending on the stream bit rate and type of access (memory file access or disk file access). Our evaluation of SharedMediaGuard compared to the traditional, disk-based allocation strategy that assumes all content must be served from disk reveals a factor of two improvement in server throughput while providing performance isolation and QoS guarantees among the <b>hosted</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
