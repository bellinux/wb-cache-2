5|$|Led by {{a strong}} {{performance}} from Aidoo, the Marauders had their most successful season in 2000. In the season opener against the tenth-ranked Waterloo Warriors, Aidoo was afflicted by leg cramps early in the game. Despite this, {{he went on to}} rush for 244 yards and scored two touchdowns in the final two minutes of the game to secure a Marauders win, 41–33. By the second game of the season, Aidoo had topped his previous season's rushing yardage total with 414 yards. He went on to be named the CIAU Offensive Player Of The Week for scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 209 yards in a 47–15 upset of the third-ranked Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks. The large victory caused the Marauders to rise to third-place in the national rankings. Aidoo had his best game of the season against the Toronto Varsity Blues, scoring five touchdowns in a 62–0 blowout. The Marauders continued to improve to a 6–0 record against the Bishop's <b>Gaiters,</b> where Aidoo scored twice and ran for 230 yards.|$|E

25|$|The Halifax Ambulance Team with Richardson in charge, records, circa. 1918, {{that the}} first and second teams of the Halifax Borough Police Ambulance Teams and the prizes, 'of which there are many', they had won during the summer months. A range of other trophies had been won by individuals. Later, in the yard of the Police Station at Harrison Road, policemen from the newly {{increased}} Mounted Section posed for a photograph. There were seven Constables wearing a white sash and <b>gaiters,</b> two Sergeants, two Inspectors and the Chief Constable. (Wearing <b>gaiters</b> and spurs.) Before the War there were only three or four mounted men. All the horses were stabled in the yard which was big enough for them and motor cars as well as Police parades. The mounted section lasted until 1944, when the number were reduced to four again, the last horses were named Pilot, Portia, Peter and Paul.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{the reforms}} brought {{about in the}} Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, all former Bombay Army units had 100 added to their numbers. Consequently, the regiment's {{designation}} was changed to 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis. In 1912, General Sir Garrett O'Moore Creagh, VC, GCB, GCSI, Commander-in-Chief, Indian Army was appointed Colonel of the 129th DCO Baluchis. He was a former Commanding Officer of the regiment. The regimental full dress uniform in 1914 included a rifle green turban and kurta (knee length tunic) piped in red, worn with red trousers and white <b>gaiters.</b> The red trousers were a distinctive feature of all five Baluch infantry regiments then serving in the Indian Army.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundPrevious {{studies have}} shown that {{so-called}} progressive elastic compression stockings (PECS) with a negative pressure gradient have a more pronounced effect on venous pump function than conventional, graduated stockings. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of higher graduated and non-graduated pressures on the venous calf pump in patients with venous disease. MethodsThe ejection fraction (EF) of the calf pump was measured by plethysmography under a standardized walking test in 20 patients suffering from chronic venous disease (CEAP C 2 –C 5) without compression, (a) with one and (b) two PECS on top of each other, and (c) with one additional conventional stocking covering only the <b>gaiter</b> area to achieve a graduated high pressure profile. Interface pressure was measured in the <b>gaiter</b> area and on the calf. ResultsA significant improvement of EF compared with baseline was found with all three compression modalities. The two superimposed PECS, providing median pressures of 33  mmHg in the <b>gaiter</b> area and 46  mmHg at calf level, increased EF significantly up into the normal range. Increasing the <b>gaiter</b> pressure to 56  mmHg without changing the calf pressure did not result in further improvement. ConclusionsTwo PECS applied on top of each other lead to a maximal improvement of the venous pump function, which cannot be further improved by increasing the pressure in the <b>gaiter</b> area thereby restoring a graduated pressure profile...|$|R

In 1906, the Prince of Wales (later George V) was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. The regimental full dress uniform in 1914 included a rifle green turban and kurta (knee length tunic) piped in red, worn with red trousers and white <b>gaiters.</b> The red trousers were a distinctive feature of all five Baluch infantry regiments then serving in the Indian Army. During the First World War the regiment served in German East Africa and Palestine. In 1918 it raised a second battalion, which was disbanded in 1920.|$|E
25|$|The BEF staff, {{who had not}} rehearsed their roles, {{performed}} poorly {{over the}} next few days. Various eyewitnesses reported that Wilson was one of the calmer members of GHQ, but he was concerned at Murray's medical unfitness and French’s apparent inability to grasp the situation. Wilson opposed Smith-Dorrien’s decision to stand and fight at Le Cateau (26 August). However, when told by Smith-Dorrien – Wilson had had to travel to the nearest village, his <b>gaiters</b> still unfastened, to use a public telephone – {{that it would not be}} possible to break off and fall back until nightfall, by his own account he wished him luck and congratulated him for his cheerful tone. Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned that he risked another Sedan.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the uniforms}} {{worn by the}} Australian Army have changed {{significantly}} over the past century, the accoutrements worn over this period have remained relatively similar. In the British Army regiments have traditionally often worn their own distinctive uniforms. However, in contrast {{there is very little}} practical difference between the dress of each unit in the Australian Army, with the majority of personnel wearing the same basic uniform (although there are some minor exceptions, worn on general duties and ceremonial uniforms—but not DPCU when worn as dress of the day or in the field—for instance with some units wearing black badges of rank, unit badges and other accoutrements, instead of the usual gold and yellow or silver and white worn respectively by all corps, while a number of Scottish companies and pipes and drum bands wear distinctive tartans and other items of traditional dress, including headdress, highland dress jacket, kilt, sporran, hose-top socks, and <b>gaiters).</b> Instead, the main uniform distinctions between corps and units include corps and regimental badges, berets, lanyards, and unit colour patches.|$|E

25|$|The raid was {{ultimately}} a failure as {{none of the}} objectives were achieved by the British. No casualties were inflicted upon the Germans, no prisoners were taken and the only damage inflicted was a cut telephone line. Additionally, {{the quality of the}} planning and conduct of the operation has been called into question. Much of the equipment used was either not servicable—faulty compasses, and motor launches that broke down—or inadequate for the job and launches that were unable to come all the way into the beach due to their draught. Also some of the tasks that had been assigned were impractical or had not been rehearsed—the wire intended for use as a road block was too heavy to carry from the beach—and intelligence relating to German dispositions upon the island was at best outdated or completely wrong. The commandos also found they were burdened with equipment that was not of use, including steel helmets, <b>gaiters</b> and an excess of ammunition. Largely this {{was the result of the}} haste with which the operation had been conceived and then put together, but it was also indicative of the embryonic status of the raiding and commandos concept.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} uniform for {{the majority}} of regiments throughout the period was the traditional red coat. There was no standardised supply for uniforms, and it was generally left to the regimental colonel to contract for and obtain uniforms for his men, which allowed for some regimental variation. Generally, this was in the form of specific regimental badges, or ornamentation for specialised flank companies, but occasionally major differences existed. Highland regiments generally wore kilts and ostrich feather hats, although six of these regiments exchanged the kilt for regulation trousers or tartan trews in 1809. Officers of Highland regiments wore a crimson silk sash worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. Regimental tartans were worn but they were all derived from the Black Watch tartan. White, yellow or red lines were added to distinguish between regiments. Trousers for the rank and file were generally of white cotton duck canvas for summer use, and grey woolen trousers were issued for winter wear, although considerable variation exists in the color of the woolen trousers. Originally, the white trousers were cut as overalls, designed to be worn to protect the expensive breeches and <b>gaiters</b> worn by the rank and file, although on campaign, they were often worn by themselves; a practice which was later permitted except on parade. Soldiers were also issued with grey greatcoats starting in 1803.|$|E

500|$|Infantry {{units in}} 1809 {{wore a black}} polrock or [...] "Polish coat", a type of frock coat derived from a Lithuanian garment called a litewka which had six pairs of black lace {{fastenings}} down the front. A tall collar showed the regimental colour. Trousers were black with a blue stripe; footwear was black shoes with buttoned <b>gaiters.</b> They wore a shako on their heads, with the skull or a hunting horn badge for light infantry, also a black feather or horsehair plume. The shako, backpack and other equipment were of Austrian design and manufacture. The Sharpshooter companies wore a dark green Prussian-style coatee and a tall hat of Austrian origin with an elongated brim turned-up at one side. In the Peninsular War, the polrock {{was replaced by a}} short black koller or cavalry-style tunic. Equipment and badges of rank were of British pattern.|$|E
500|$|The most {{recognisable}} item of the herald's wardrobe {{has always}} been their tabards. Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first {{it is likely that}} the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even from the beginning that would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural diplomatic status. John Anstis wrote that: [...] "The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of Mordecai, under a king of Persia." [...] The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the judges' wigs and (until the last century) the bishop's <b>gaiters.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most suits have {{relatively}} baggy trouser legs to allow {{passage of the}} feet to the boots. This can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet. Elastic or tailored [...] "gaiters" [...] can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain horizontal trim. <b>Gaiters</b> may also reduce hydrodynamic drag when finning, {{reduce the risk of}} the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function. Small ankle-weights (typically one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight {{at the bottom of the}} suit, and function as short <b>gaiters</b> to constrict the ankle region of suit once the foot is in the boot. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated and decelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more energy from the diver. <b>Gaiters</b> do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy.|$|E
