50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> or Natal {{rock oyster}} (Saccostrea cucullata) is {{a species of}} rock oyster found mainly in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> is {{tolerant}} {{of a wide}} range of temperatures and salinities. Breeding takes place between June and October in the Northern Hemisphere. The larvae are planktonic and preferentially settle out of the water column in locations already occupied by adult oysters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> is {{a filter}} feeder, pumping water through its gills and {{removing}} the phytoplankton. In polluted waters, it accumulates heavy metals in its tissues. For this reason {{it can be}} used as a bioindicator for monitoring pollution. Because it selectively removes these metals and is such an efficient biofilter, it has been used in the Persian Gulf to control pollution.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> {{is common}} {{on the east}} coast of Africa, where it cements itself to rocks or to the {{branches}} and roots of mangroves. It sometimes even grows on the shell of a large gastropod mollusc, the mangrove whelk (Terebralia palustris), which grazes beneath the mangrove canopy. In Australia, another gastropod, the black oyster borer (Morula marginalba) feeds on the oyster [...] by drilling a hole through its shell. It then inserts its radula and chews up the body before sucking out the pieces.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> {{is found}} in the Indian Ocean and {{tropical}} west Pacific Ocean. In East Africa, its range includes Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. In India, it is {{one of a number of}} commercially exploited oyster species. It is also found in Australia, New Zealand, and the Red Sea. It was first seen in Turkey in 1999 and seems to have become established in the eastern end of the Mediterranean. It favours rocky habitats in the intertidal zone, and is found at depths down to about 15 m, often growing among seaweed. It is part of the fouling community and is found on harbour walls, pilings, and other underwater structures.|$|E
50|$|The Sydney rock oyster, New Zealand rock oyster, or Auckland oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), is {{an oyster}} species endemic to Australia and New Zealand. In Australia {{it is found}} in bays, inlets and {{sheltered}} estuaries from Wingan Inlet in eastern Victoria, along {{the east coast of}} New South Wales and up to Hervey Bay, Queensland, around northern Australia and down the west coast to Shark Bay in Western Australia. There is also a small introduced population on Flinders Island, in Bass Strait, Tasmania and in Albany on the south west coast of Western Australia, where they are farmed. In New Zealand, where the species is not farmed, it is known as the New Zealand rock oyster or Auckland oyster. The Sydney rock oyster is closely related to Saccostrea cucullata, or <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster,</b> which is common on Indo-Pacific rocky shores.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} and {{form of the}} <b>hooded</b> <b>oyster</b> is very variable. The shape is sometimes nearly circular {{or it may be}} oblong or roughly oval, often with an irregular outline. In the Mediterranean, it grows to 4 to 6 cm, but achieves double that size in the Pacific Ocean. The valves are thick and solid. The lower valve is convex and has no sculpturing near the umbo, which is fixed to the substrate. The upper valve is flat and smaller than the lower valve. It may have wide, sometimes spiny, ribs but is sometimes quite smooth. The margins of the valves are pleated and fit together neatly. The ligament is internal and there are no teeth on the hinge joint. The right valve has some small denticles on its margin which fit into grooves in the left valve margin. A single large adductor muscle holds the valves together, which leaves a large, kidney-shaped scar on the inside of each valve. The colour is purplish-brown {{on the outside of the}} valves. The inside is white rimmed with black. This oyster could be confused with the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), but is distinguished by having a crenulated margin.|$|E
