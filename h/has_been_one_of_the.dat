5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars {{during the second half of}} the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E
5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
