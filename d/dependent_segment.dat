Accordingly, buildings’ energy efficiency is planned in the design phase and it is calculated according to procedure stated by Laws; nevertheless, the actual performance of the building differs by the predicted one due to factors associated to the uncertainties diffused in the modelling, construction and operating phases. In predicting the {{energy performance}}, design assumption and modelling tools define the boundaries of uncertainty while discussing about real performance built quality, occupancy behavior and management & controls determine the strong variability in the energy results. Therefore, building energy performance simulation requires models, which describe physical phenomena with different levels of detail and accuracy. Detailed dynamic models are accurate {{but on the other}} hand require detailed input data and the simulations are time-consuming whereas surrogate models consider only the most relevant parameters that contribute to outline the energy performance. The proposed methodology combines the two model strategies using the detailed simulations to train two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of assessing the heating and cooling demands based on climate and occupancy data. The trained ANNs can predict energy performance of the building with different occupancy rates reducing the use of time-expensive detailed simulations. Moreover, in a Building Management System (BMS) ANNs may be fed by real-time data acquired by sensors and control the settings of systems and devices (e. g. HVAC, shading devices, artificial lighting, etc.).

40|$|The Landauer {{expression}} for computing current-voltage characteristics in nanoscale devices is efficient and widely applicable but not suited to transient phenomena and time dependent currents because {{it assumes that}} the charge carrier population attains a time independent dynamic equilibrium {{as soon as the}} external voltage is turned on. In this article, we construct a very general {{expression for}} a time dependent current in an electrode-molecule-electrode arrangement. Utilizing a model Hamiltonian, we propagate the Schrodinger wave function equation to numerically compute the time dependent population in the individual sub-systems. The current in each electrode (defined in terms of the rate of change of the corresponding population) has two components, one due to the charges originating from the same electrode and the other due to the charges initially residing at the other electrode. We derive an analytical expression for the first component and illustrate that it agrees reasonably with the numerical counterpart at early times. The structural form reveals that the initial occupancy can be factored out of the time <b>dependent</b> <b>segment</b> of the expression. We take this cue to construct a Landauer style formula and demonstrate that the current obtained from this simplified formula overlaps with our most general numerical current only after the charge flow settles into a steady state. Thus, we illustrate the emergence of Landauer transport from a true first-principles quantum dynamics calculation without any prior assumptions. Subsequently, we investigate the ingredients in our model that regulate the onset time scale of this Landauer regime. We compare the performance of our general current expression with the Landauer current for time dependent electronic coupling. Finally, we comment on the applicability of the Landauer formulas to compute hot-electron current arising upon plasmon decoherence.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{shows how}} signers mark polite register in JSL and uncovers {{a number of}} features salient to the linguistic encoding of politeness. My investigation of JSL politeness considers the relationship between Japanese sign and speech and how users of these languages adapt their communicative style based on the social context. This work examines: the Deaf Japanese community as minority language users and the concomitant effects {{on the development of}} JSL; politeness in JSL independently and in relation to spoken Japanese, along with the subsequent implications for characterizing polite Japanese communicative interaction; and the results of two studies that provide descriptions {{of the ways in which}} JSL users linguistically encode polite register. The studies show that JSL displays social indexical features with potential typological salience across sign languages. The elaborate system of overt encoding of polite expression in Japanese speech is commonly conceived of as indicating and reinforcing the special significance of polite behavior or practice in Japanese society. Nevertheless, sign language users as members of an overlapping society use a different language, which either marks politeness contrastively or fails to signify certain aspects of politeness signaled by spoken Japanese. The structural contrasts between JSL and spoken Japanese show that a language must receive consideration in light of actual communicative practice in order to determine its relation to social norms. Additionally, the reliance of JSL on <b>dependent</b> <b>segments,</b> or nonmanuals, to mark polite expression indicates that any linguistic analysis of politeness is impoverished as long as such kinds of <b>dependent</b> <b>segments,</b> analogous to features such as prosody in spoken languages, do not receive consideration. Since JSL and spoken Japanese represent, in a sense, two languages sharing one society, they represent a novel language contact context in which two languages segregate primarily via language modality rather than physical geography, as in the case of spoken contact languages. Using contact signed and spoken language pairs, researchers can uniquely tease apart the relation between language use and social context as a sign language is cultivated in a closely related society or ground of material relations of a preexisting spoken language. Chapter Two, "JSL as a Minority Language" illustrates the social context of Deaf Japanese people and JSL, and shows how Deaf Japanese inhabit a society dominated by a hearing culture. The resultant saturation in the language-context relations of the hearing culture produces a sign language with a number of influences from the socially dominant spoken and written language culture, along with concomitant effects on the JSL lexicon and morphology. A shared visual-kinesic communicative culture additionally results in a JSL that has assimilated features bearing resemblance to gestures from the inventory of speakers and signers. Chapter Three, "Japanese Signer and Speaker Polite Expression" demonstrates that although the structures of JSL and spoken Japanese differ, they have the capacity to index the same social interaction contexts. The presence of two differing languages, with a mixture of shared and unique indices, derived from a shared social milieu demonstrates that the examination of language structures in relation to their actual application is prerequisite to framing any cross-cultural analysis grounded in linguistic form. Chapter Four, "JSL Politeness Studies" unearths a number of JSL politeness marking features, including nonmanual, lexical and discourse features. The first study reproduces for JSL the Hill et al. Pen Study (1986) and elicits responses to a request for a pen signed with various levels of politeness. The second study replicates the Hoza ASL study (2007) and uses a Discourse Completion Test (Blum-Kulka et al. 1989) to collect responses from JSL signers to request scenarios. The close examination of polite expression via the two JSL studies shows that a subset of JSL politeness marking features appear to emerge from the visual-kinesthetic modality shared with Japanese speakers, as some features maintain enough transparency for non-signers to interpret them similarly to signers. Additionally, besides confirming some of the results of an earlier JSL politeness study by Okabe et al. (2005), the studies identify a number of politeness indices in JSL similar to register marking cues described in the ASL literature (Berkowitz 2008; Cokely and Baker-Shenk 1980; Hoza, 2007; Liddell and Johnson 1989 [1985]; Roush 2007 [1999]; Zimmer 1989). JSL exhibits particular politeness indexing features shared with ASL, such as the polite grimace, manipulation of signing space size and variation of signing rate, which may have typological salience across sign languages...|$|R

40|$|ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) {{elements}} are DNA fragments that can function as origins of DNA replication in yeast. We report the first fine-structure analysis of ars 1, an ARS {{element of the}} fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Characterization {{of a series of}} nested deletion mutations indicated that the minimal fragment of DNA encompassing ars 1 is surprisingly large. No fragment < 650 bp retained significant ARS activity. Analysis of deletion and substitution mutations scanning the entire minimal ars 1 identified a single essential 50 bp fragment (segment 1). Only one other 50 bp mutation reduced activity as much as 5 -fold and most deletions were without effect. Thus, the minimal ars 1 is composed of two general types of genetic elements, a small segment that is absolutely required for efficient ARS activity and a much larger region that is tolerant of internal structural alterations. Higher resolution analysis of segment 1 defined a critical 30 bp A/T-rich segment which appears to contain redundant genetic elements. Schizosaccharomyces pombe ars 1 promoted high frequency transformation in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae but this heterologous activity was not <b>dependent</b> on <b>segment</b> 1.

The most severe lesions are located in <b>dependent</b> lung <b>segments</b> along a sterno-vertebral axis, however the cephalocaudal distribution of lung infection remains unknown. We used an experimental model to evaluate the distribution of lung infection, considering its anteroposterior and cephalocaudal gradient, {{and its impact on}} lung aeration. Ten healthy domestic piglets were anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated for 59 hours in the prone position. At the end of the experiment they were sacrificed and their lungs were fixed. Six segments were analyzed: a non-dependant (ND) and a dependant (D) segment of the upper (UL), middle (ML) and lower (LL) lobes. The presence of healthy lung or of histological infectious lesions was analyzed with a semiquantitative method. The regional distribution of lung infection was compared between upper, middle and lower lobes, as well as between dependant and non-dependant regions. The presence of infectious lesions was correlated with measurements of lung aeration. Nine of the ten piglets developed VAP. Infectious lesions were distributed along a sterno-vertebral and a cephalocaudal gradient; the lower and middle lobes were more frequently infected than the upper lobes. There was an inverse correlation (R= - 0. 902) between the development of lung lesions and lung aeration. In conclusion, VAP was a frequent complication in healthy mechanically ventilated piglets, showing an anteroposterior as well as a cephalocaudal gradient. As expected, development of lung infection was accompanied by a corresponding loss of aeration...|$|R

We examined the contraction of cardiac myocytes {{originating from}} the apex, ventricle, and atrium, and found that their dynamic behavior, such as amplitude and frequen-cy of contraction, differs depending on the heart segment of origin. Using video microscopy and high-precision image correlation, we found that: (1) apex myocytes exhibited the highest contraction rate (17 beats/min); (2) ventricular myocytes exhibited the highest contraction amplitude (5. 2 micron); and (3) as myocyte contraction synchro-nized, their frequency did not change significantly, but the amplitude of contraction increased in apex and ventricular myocytes. In addition, as myocyte cultures mature they formed contractile filaments, further emphasizing the dif-ference in myocyte dynamics is persistent. These results suggest that the dynamic behavior (in addition to static properties) of myocytes is <b>dependent</b> on their <b>segment</b> of origin...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of {{intravenous}} vitamin C administration on the vasomotor responses to intracoronary L-arginine infusion in epicardial coronary arteries. METHODS: 28 patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina {{were enrolled in the}} study. Eight patients received intracoronary infusions of 150 micromol/min L-arginine before and after intravenous infusion of vitamin C, 10 patients received intracoronary infusions of 150 micromol/min L-arginine before and after intravenous infusion of normal saline, and 10 patients received intracoronary normal saline before and after intravenous infusion of vitamin C. The diameter of proximal and distal coronary artery segments was measured by quantitative angiography. RESULTS: Infusion of L-arginine caused significant dilatation of both proximal (4. 87 (0. 96) %, p < 0. 01 v normal saline) and distal (6. 33 (1. 38) %, p < 0. 01 v normal saline) coronary segments. Co-infusion of vitamin C and L-arginine dilated proximal coronary segments by 8. 68 (1. 40) % (p < 0. 01 v normal saline, p < 0. 01 v L-arginine) and distal segments by 13. 07 (2. 15) % (p < 0. 01 v normal saline, p < 0. 01 v L-arginine).

Twenty-four segments from 12 external jugular veins from 6 New Zealand White rabbits were harvested from the proximal (near the thoracic inlet) or distal (near the linguofacial vein/external jugular vein bifurcation) external jugular vein with in vivo lengths of either 3 or 8 mm. Segments were studied in vitro at their resting tension in an organ bath system. The results showed that bradykinin (BK) - and histamine (HIST) -induced maximal active tension was dependent on vessel size (BK: 3 mm segments 0. 54 &plusmn; 0. 10 g vs 8 mm segments 1. 42 &plusmn; 0. 23 g, P = 0. 0003 by paired t test; HIST: 3 mm segments 0. 49 &plusmn; 0. 15 vs 8 mm segments 1. 10 &plusmn; 0. 24, P = 0. 018) and weight (BK: P < 0. 0001 by linear regression; HIST: P = 0. 0031). In contrast, BK sensi-tivity was dependent on location (proximal segments,-logED 50 7. 81 &plusmn; 0. 15 vs distal segments 8. 48 &plusmn; 0. 14, P = 0. 0006) but was not dependent on size (3 mm segments 8. 24 &plusmn; 0. 22 vs 8 mm segments 8. 05 &plusmn; 0. 11, P = 0. 33) or weight (P = 0. 58). HIST sensi-tivity, acetylcholine-induced relaxation (endothelium dependent), and sodium nitro-prusside-induced relaxation (endothelium independent) were not <b>dependent</b> on <b>segment</b> length, weight, or location. Because significant differences in vasoreactivity exist along the short length of the external jugular vein, vein segment length and location should be rigorously standardized during vasoreactivity experiments. Increased agonist sensitivity from distal to proximal {{along the length of}} a vein may provide an additional mechanism for venous return. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on March 5, 2016 ves. sagepub. comDownloaded from 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to analyze the performance and the added value of automatic recommender systems in an industrial context. We show that recommender systems are multifaceted and can be organized around 4 structuring functions: help users to decide, help users to compare, help users to discover, help users to explore. A global off line protocol is then proposed to evaluate recommender systems. This protocol {{is based on the}} definition of appropriate evaluation measures for each aforementioned function. The evaluation protocol is discussed {{from the perspective of the}} usefulness and trust of the recommendation. A new measure called Average Measure of Impact is introduced. This measure evaluates the impact of the personalized recommendation. We experiment with two classical methods, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF), using the well known dataset: Netflix. A segmentation of both users and items is proposed to finely analyze where the algorithms perform well or badly. We show that the performance is strongly <b>dependent</b> on the <b>segments</b> and that there is no clear correlation between the RMSE and the quality of the recommendation.

40|$|Nephron segment {{and calcium}} as {{determinants}} of anoxic cell death in renal cultures. Proximal tubules of the S 1, S 2 and S 3 segments, medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (MAL) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT) were individually microdissected from rabbit kidneys and cultured {{for seven days}} in hormonally defined media. Anoxia was induced by incubation of cultures in normal medium for 45 min at 25 °C {{in an atmosphere of}} nitrogen (N 2), and cell death was measured by nigrosine dye uptake. Immediately after anoxia, cell death was highest in S 3 and MAL segments > S 2 > S 1 = CCT. The combined effects of anoxia and substrate (glucose, vitamins, amino acid) omission determined after incubation of cultures in phosphate buffered saline containing Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + (PBS) for 45 min in N 2 also showed differential killing <b>dependent</b> on <b>segment</b> of origin: MAL > S 3 > S 2 CCT > S 1. The effects of in vitro “reflow” were tested by returning cells to their normal oxygenated culture media at 37 °C. After the 45 min of anoxia and four to six hr of reflow in normal calcium–containing media, all cells from each segment were dead. Reflow in media lacking calcium for two hr immediately after anoxia then followed by return to normal calcium–containing media was associated with the survival of a significant percentage of cells for 48 hr: S 1 (35. 3 ± 2. 0 %), S 2 (30. 0 ± 2. 0 %), S 3 (46. 2 ± 3. 0 %), MAL (38. 7 ± 3. 0 %), CCT (28. 2 ± 2. 0 %). These results indicate that cells from different nephron segments have different intrinsic susceptibilities to anoxia and that the catastrophic effect on cell survival induced by “reflow”, that is, return of oxygen and substrates, can be significantly attenuated by removal of calcium from the environment for the initial two hr after the insult...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis was to obtain new information about mechanisms of thermomechanical pulp refining in the inner area of a refiner disc gap by studying inter-fibre refining and by calculating the distribution of energy consumption in the refiner disc gap. The energy consumption of thermomechanical pulping process is very high although theoretically {{a small amount of}} energy is needed to create new fibre surfaces. Mechanisms of refining have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} high energy consumption of the process, however, phenomena in the inner area of disc gap has had less attention. It is likely that this important position is causing high energy consumption due to the high residence time of pulp located there. The power distribution as a function of the refiner disc gap was calculated in this work. The calculation was based on mass and energy balances, as well as temperature and consistency profiles determined by mill trials. The power distribution was found to be <b>dependent</b> on <b>segment</b> geometry and the refining stage. However, in the first stage refiner with standard refiner segments, a notable amount of power was consumed in the inner area of the disc gap. Fibre-to-fibre refining is likely to be the most important mechanism in the inner area of disc gap from the point of view of energy consumption. In this work the inter-fibre refining was studied using equipment for shear and compression. Fibre-to-fibre refining was found to be an effective way to refine fibres from coarse pulp to separated, fibrillated and peeled fibres if frictional forces inside the compressed pulp were high enough. It was proposed that high energy of today’s thermomechanical pulping process could derive from too low frictional forces that heated pulp and evaporated water without any changes in fibre structure. The method to calculate power distribution and results of fibre-to-fibre refining experiments may give ideas for developing today’s thermomechanical pulp refiners’ or for developing totally new energy saving mechanical pulping processes...|$|R
40|$|The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} family regulates various {{central nervous}} system functions, such as synaptic plasticity. However, hypo- or hyperactivation of NMDA receptors is critically involved in many neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as pain, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegeneration, schizophrenia, and depression. Consequently, subtype-selective positive and negative modulators of NMDA receptor function have many potential therapeutic applications not addressed by currently available compounds. We have identified allosteric modulators with several novel patterns of NMDA receptor subtype selectivity that have a novel mechanism of action. In a series of carboxylated naphthalene and phenanthrene derivatives, compounds were identified that selectively potentiate responses at GluN 1 /GluN 2 A [e. g., 9 -iodophenanthrene- 3 -carboxylic acid (UBP 512) ]; GluN 1 /GluN 2 A and GluN 1 /GluN 2 B [9 -cyclopropylphenanthrene- 3 -carboxylic acid (UBP 710) ]; GluN 1 /GluN 2 D [3, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene- 2 -carboxylic acid (UBP 551) ]; or GluN 1 /GluN 2 C and GluN 1 /GluN 2 D receptors [6 -, 7 -, 8 -, and 9 -nitro isomers of naphth[1, 2 -c][1, 2, 5]oxadiazole- 5 -sulfonic acid (NSC 339614) ] and have no effect or inhibit responses at the other NMDA receptors. Selective inhibition was also observed; UBP 512 inhibits only GluN 1 /GluN 2 C and GluN 1 /GluN 2 D receptors, whereas 6 -bromo- 2 -oxo- 2 H-chromene- 3 -carboxylic acid (UBP 608) inhibits GluN 1 /GluN 2 A receptors with a 23 -fold selectivity compared with GluN 1 /GluN 2 D receptors. The actions of these compounds were not competitive with the agonists l-glutamate or glycine and were not voltage-dependent. Whereas the N-terminal regulatory domain was not necessary for activity of either potentiators or inhibitors, segment 2 of the agonist ligand-binding domain was important for potentiating activity, whereas subtype-specific inhibitory activity was <b>dependent</b> upon <b>segment</b> 1. In terms of chemical structure, activity profile, and mechanism of action, these modulators represent {{a new class of}} pharmacological agents for the study of NMDA receptor subtype function and provide novel lead compounds for a variety of neurological disorders...|$|R
