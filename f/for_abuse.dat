5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open <b>for</b> <b>abuse</b> that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential <b>for</b> <b>abuse</b> of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity <b>for</b> <b>abuse</b> that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to seek further {{understanding}} of what school staff, social services and staff at the shelters consider to be the difficulties in the work of children's schooling when staying at shelters <b>for</b> <b>abused</b> women. The method used was qualitative semi structured interviews and the empirics consist of six interviews, two from each profession. Despite a comprehensive searching strategy, only a few studies were found that had examined the subject and those studies described the problem briefly. This indicates that the subject has been little researched and that children's schooling in shelters <b>for</b> <b>abused</b> women is a subject we have little knowledge about. The results show that there usually are no systematic routines for dealing with the issue among professionals involved. It is difficult to get a new school place for children staying in shelters <b>for</b> <b>abused</b> women. Professions involved with these children in society need more knowledge in the subject to develop a systematic approach. In future, more research on the subject and its consequences for children in shelters <b>for</b> <b>abused</b> women is needed...|$|R
