5|$|The {{population}} of Scotland {{in this period}} is unknown. The first reliable information in 1755 shows the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380.

5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; the number who died remains disputed, ranging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> of 30 {{to a high of}} 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E

5|$|Military {{training}} {{was conducted at}} the college as early as 1925, but formal Reserve Officers' Training Corps training did not start until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Though enrollment declined during World War II, Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its armed forces training detachments.

5|$|Nilofar {{originated}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> pressure {{area between}} India and the Arabian Peninsula. It {{developed into a}} depression on October25 and moved generally northward through an area of favorable conditions. The system intensified into a cyclonic storm on October26. Quickly organizing due to the conditions, Nilofar developed a well-defined eye and structure, attaining its peak intensity on October28. At the time, Nilofar was expected to make landfall in western India, prompting evacuations and preparations. However, high wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and Nilofar degraded into a remnant low pressure area on October31 off the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Shimer {{emerged from}} {{bankruptcy}} in 1980. During the next 25 years, the college purchased 12 surrounding homes {{and the former}} YWCA facility at Genesee and Franklin Streets to form a makeshift campus and slowly progressed towards financial stability. By 1988 its enrollment had grown <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> of 40 to 114, and income exceeded expenses. In 1991, Shimer received {{a grant from the}} National Endowment for the Humanities with the help of NEH chair and core-curriculum advocate Lynne Cheney; the grant revitalized the school's fundraising, helping it raise $2million.|$|E

Additionally, small rodents, including squirrels, mice, and rats, are important in the sylvatic transmission cycle because of their importance as bloodmeal sources for the insect vectors.

5|$|The National Telecommunications Commission is {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for the supervision, adjudication and control over all telecommunications services throughout the country. There are approximately 383 AM and 659 FM radio stations and 297 television and 873 cable television stations. On March 29, 1994, the country went live on the Internet via a 64 kbit/s connection from a router serviced by PLDT to a Sprint router in California.

By August 1948, the majority of the nationalist leaders were killed or captured, and the Uprising was effectively put down by December 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Floyd were <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} {{area in the}} Gulf of Honduras on October 5. Over the subsequent few days, it drifted eastward and later southward to a position off {{the east coast of}} Nicaragua. On October9, a Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed the development of an organized circulation, which indicated that Tropical Depression Thirteen had developed. After continuing a southward drift, the depression turned to the north and later northwest due to a building ridge to its east. With an anticyclone aloft, the depression gradually organized, intensifying into Tropical Storm Floyd on October10.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{classified}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful {{in the vicinity of}} pine plantations. It has been listed as vulnerable in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> of 19–21 individuals in 1998.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
