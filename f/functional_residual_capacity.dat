Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. Thinner persons tend to have a larger capacity, and capacity can be increased by physical training as much as 40%.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all the air}} in {{the lungs}} can be {{expelled}} during maximally forced exhalation. This is the residual volume of about 1.0-1.5liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> of about 2.5-3.0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} air that moves {{in or out}} (at the nose or mouth) during a single {{breathing}} cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human it is about 500ml per breath. At the end of exhalation the airways contain about 150ml of alveolar air {{which is the first}} air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350ml (500ml - 150ml = 350ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after normal exhalation (i.e. the <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> of about 2.5–3.0liters), {{it is clear that the}} composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14kPa (about 100mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3kPa (or 40mmHg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21kPa (or 160mmHg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04kPa (or 0.3mmHg).|$|E

500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} usually resolves itself {{without causing}} permanent complications; however {{it may also}} have long-term ill effects on respiratory function. Most contusions resolve in five to sevendays after the injury. [...] Signs detectable by radiography are usually gone within 10days after the injury—when they are not, other conditions, such as pneumonia, are the likely cause. [...] Chronic lung disease correlates {{with the size of}} the contusion and can interfere with an individual's ability to return to work. Fibrosis of the lungs can occur, resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath), low blood oxygenation, and reduced <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> for as long as six years after the injury. As late as four years post-injury, decreased <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> has been found in most pulmonary contusion patients studied. During the six months after pulmonary contusion, up to 90% of people suffer difficulty breathing. In some cases, dyspnea persists for an indefinite period. [...] Contusion can also permanently reduce the compliance of the lungs.|$|E
500|$|The lungs are {{not capable}} of {{expanding}} themselves, and will only do so {{when there is an}} increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This is achieved by the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram. During breathing out, at rest, the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a resting position determined by their anatomical elasticity. At this point the lungs contain the <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 litres.|$|E
500|$|During heavy {{breathing}} as, for instance, during exercise, {{a large number}} of accessory muscles in the neck and abdomen are recruited. Exhalation, instead of being passive, is now caused by the rib cage being actively pulled downwards at the front and sides by the abdominal muscles. This has the effect of decreasing the size of the rib cage, and of pushing the abdominal organs up against the diaphragm which bulges into the thorax. The lung volume of air at the end of exhalation is now less than the resting FRC. However, the lungs cannot be emptied completely and in an adult human there is always still at least one litre of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation. The FRC always remains in the alveoli after a normal out-breath. With each breath only about 350ml (i.e. less than 15%) of this alveolar air is expelled into the ambient air (with about 150ml [...] remaining behind in the airways, as [...] "dead space" [...] ventilation, as it is the first air to re-enter the alveoli on inhalation). This is immediately replaced with the same volume of fresh, but moistened, atmospheric air. It is therefore obvious that the 350ml inhaled fresh air is highly diluted by the 3litres of <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> air (i.e. the air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation), and that the composition of the alveolar air therefore changes very little under normal circumstances: the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen remains very close to 14kPa (105mmHg), and that of carbon dioxide varies minimally around 5.3kPa (40mmHg) throughout the respiratory cycle (of inhalation and exhalation).|$|E

The {{core of this}} method {{is based on the}} single path model (SPM) of airway gas exchange that simulates single breath CO 2 airway washout (SBCO 2) under a variety of conditions. We fix lung structure by matching the normalized phase III CO 2 slope (NS) vs. exhaled tidal volume between a given subject and the scaled Weibel lung. Using the SPM for this scaled lung, a database containing the volume of CO 2 evolved per breath (V 2 ̆ 6 dot;CO 2) and the NS over a range of CO and MVpCO 2 values for a variety of tidal volumes, breathing frequencies, and <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> is obtained.

2500|$|This marked {{difference}} between {{the composition of the}} alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined {{with the fact that the}} lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special [...] "portable atmosphere", whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air. It is this portable atmosphere (the <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacity)</b> to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed – not to the outside air.|$|E
2500|$|During {{exhalation}} {{the diaphragm}} and intercostal muscles relax. This returns {{the chest and}} abdomen to a position determined by their anatomical elasticity.

40|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} (BPD) is {{a chronic}} lung disease that predominantly affects prematurely born infants. Initially BPD {{was described in}} infants who had suffered severe respiratory failure and required high pressure, mechanical ventilation with high concentrations of supplementary oxygen. It now also occurs in very prematurely born infants who initially had minimal or even no signs of lung disease. These differences impact {{on the nature of}} the lung function abnormalities suffered by BPD infants, which is also influenced by the criteria used to diagnose BPD and the oxygen saturation level used to determine the supplementary oxygen requirement. Key also to interpreting lung function data in this population is whether appropriate lung function tests have been used and in an adequately sized population to make meaningful conclusions. It should also be emphasised that BPD is a poor predictor of long term respiratory morbidity. Bearing in mind those caveats, studies have consistently demonstrated that infants who develop BPD have low compliance and <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> and raised resistances in the neonatal period. There is, however, no agreement with regard to which early lung function measurement predicts the development of BPD, likely reflecting different techniques were used in different populations in often underpowered studies. During infancy, lung function generally improves, but importantly airflow limitation persists and small airway function appears to decline. Assessment of lung function has demonstrated that improvements in lung function following diuretics or bronchodilators have not translated into long term improvements in respiratory outcomes. In contrast, early differences in lung function related to different ventilation modes have led to investigation and demonstration that prophylactic, neonatal high frequency oscillation appears to protect small airway function...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Single lung {{function}} is usually assessed by radioisotopes or, more rarely, by bronchospirometry {{in which a}} double lumen catheter is used to separate ventilation of the two lungs. The latter is more precise but less comfortable. An alternative bronchoscopic method is described for determining the volume of a single lung. METHODS [...] One mainstem bronchus was temporarily occluded with an inflatable balloon during fibreoptic bronchoscopy in 12 healthy volunteers aged 18 - 29 years. The <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> <b>capacities</b> (FRC) of the right, left, and both lungs were measured in duplicate by closed circuit helium dilution. Supplementary vital capacity (VC) manoeuvres permitted calculation of single lung <b>capacities</b> (TLC) and <b>residual</b> volumes (RV). RESULTS [...] The standard deviation of a single determination of capacities of the right, left, and both lungs were: TLC, 80, 96, and 308 ml; VC, 56, 139, 171 ml; FRC, 131, 74, and 287 ml; RV, 112, 185, and 303 ml, respectively. The sum of {{the right and left}} unilateral TLC was not different from bilateral TLC (6. 12 v 5. 95 l) and the sum of the unilateral FRC was not different from the bilateral FRC (2. 60 v 2. 78 l). The sum of the unilateral VC was lower than bilateral VC (4. 52 v 4. 80 l), that of the unilateral RV was higher than bilateral RV (1. 60 v 1. 16 l). For all subdivisions of lung volume, the right lung was larger than the left. The most common complaint was substernal discomfort during complete exhalation. Oxygen saturation rarely fell below 90 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] Temporary occlusion of a mainstem bronchus in normal subjects is safe, relatively simple, and allows fairly precise and accurate measurements of unilateral static lung volumes. Occlusion at TLC, however, probably prevents proper emptying of the non-occluded lung...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} poorly reversible airflow limitation. The pathological hallmarks of COPD are inflammation of the peripheral airways and destruction of lung parenchyma or emphysema. The functional consequences of these abnormalities are expiratory airflow limitation and dynamic hyperinflation, which then increase the elastic load of the respiratory system and decrease {{the performance of the}} respiratory muscles. These pathophysiologic features contribute significantly to the development of dyspnea, exercise intolerance and ventilatory failure. Several treatments may palliate flow limitation, including interventions that modify the respiratory pattern (deeper, slower) such as pursed lip breathing, exercise training, oxygen, and some drugs. Other therapies are aimed at its amelioration, such as bronchodilators, lung volume reduction surgery or breathing mixtures of helium and oxygen. Finally some interventions, such as inspiratory pressure support, alleviate the threshold load associated to flow limitation. The degree of flow limitation can be assessed by certain spirometry indexes, such as vital capacity and inspiratory capacity, or by other more complexes indexes such as <b>residual</b> volume/total lung <b>capacity</b> or <b>functional</b> <b>residual</b> capacity/total lung <b>capacity.</b> Two of the best method...|$|R

Protective ventilation strategies can reduce the incidence of atelectasis (which still remains one of the principal causes of PDD) and pulmonary infections in surgical patients.
