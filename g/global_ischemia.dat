In {{this study we}} investigated the importance of oxygenation for protection with esmolol cardioplegia, compared it with that of St Thomas' Hospital cardioplegia, and determined the protective efficacy of multidose esmolol cardioplegia for extended ischemic durations. Methods: Isolated rat hearts (n = 6 /group) were perfused in the Langendorff mode at constant pressure (75 mm Hg) with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer at 37 Â°C. The {{first part of the}} first study had four groups: (i) multidose (every 15 minutes) oxygenated (95 % oxygen/ 5 % carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit buffer during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> (ii) multidose deoxygenated (95 % nitrogen/ 5 % carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit buffer during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> (iii) multidose oxygenated esmolol cardioplegia during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> and (iv) multidose deoxygenated esmolol cardioplegia during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia.</b> The second part of the first study had three groups: (v) multidose St Thomas' Hospital solution during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> (vi) multidose oxygenated St Thomas' Hospital solution during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> and (vii) multidose oxygenated esmolol cardioplegia during 60 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia.</b> In the second study, hearts were randomly assigned to 60, 75, 90, or 120 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and at each ischemic duration were subjected to multidose oxygenated constant flow or constant pressure infusion of (i) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (constant flow), (ii) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (constant pressure), (iii) esmolol cardioplegia (constant flow), or (iv) esmolol cardioplegia (constant pressure). All hearts were reperfused for 60 minutes, and recovery of function was measured. Results: Multidose infusion of oxygenated esmolol cardioplegia completely protected the hearts (97 % Â± 5 %) after 60 minutes of 37 Â°C <b>global</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Deoxygenated esmolol cardioplegia was significantly less protective (45 % Â± 8 %). Oxygenation of St Thomas' Hospital solution did not alter its protective efficacy in this study (70 % Â± 4 % vs 69 % Â± 7 %). Infusion of esmolol cardioplegia at constant pressure provided complete protection for 60, 75, and 90 minutes (104 % Â± 5 %, 95 % Â± 5 %, and 95 % Â± 3 %, respectively), whereas protection with constant-flow esmolol cardioplegic infusion was significantly decreased at ischemic durations longer than 60 minutes. This decrease in efficacy of constant-flow esmolol cardioplegia was associated with increasing coronary perfusion pressure leading to myocardial injury. Conclusions: Oxygenation of esmolol cardioplegia (Krebs-Henseleit buffer plus 1. 0 mmol/L esmolol) was essential for optimal myocardial protection. Multidose infusion of oxygenated esmolol cardioplegia provided good myocardial protection during extended periods of normothermic ischemia.

Methods: We compared cytosolic calcium accumulation before ischemia (control), during 30 minutes of ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion under <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> or after treatment with potassium (20 mmol/L), magnesium (20 mmol/L), or both. Results: Cytosolic calcium accumulation was increased during <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> in the mature heart (from 178. 7 Â± 24. 2 {{in the control group}} to 393. 6 Â± 25. 5 nmol/L; p < 0. 005) and in the aged heart (from 187. 4 Â± 18. 7 in the control group to 501. 0 Â± 46. 1 nmol/L; p < 0. 005). Potassium reduced cytosolic calcium accumulation during ischemia in both the mature and aged hearts (300. 9 Â± 23. 2 and 365. 2 Â± 27. 7 nmol/L, respectively; p < 0. 05 vs <b>global</b> <b>ischemia).</b> Magnesium and potassium/magnesium completely controlled cytosolic calcium accumulation in the mature heart (198. 7 Â± 27. 5 nmol/L; p < 0. 01 vs <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and p < 0. 05 vs potassium: 182. 3 Â± 22. 7 nmol/L; p < 0. 05 vs <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and potassium, respectively). Magnesium and potassium/magnesium attenuated cytosolic calcium accumulation in the aged heart (261. 3 Â± 26. 7, 262. 3 Â± 25. 2 nmol/L, respectively; p < 0. 01 vs <b>global</b> <b>ischemia).</b> These changes in cytosolic calcium accumulation correlated with improved postischemic ventricular function. To investigate the mechanism(s) of magnesium-supplemented cardioplegic inhibition of cytosolic calcium accumulation, we performed parallel studies (n = 43) using nifedipine, ryanodine, and dimethylthiourea. Nifedipine with or without ryanodine reduced cytosolic calcium accumulation. Dimethylthiourea did not alter cytosolic calcium accumulation during <b>global</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Our results suggest that cytosolic calcium accumulation during <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> was mainly increased via the sarcolemmal 1 -type calcium channel and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channel.

Conclusion: Senescent cardiac dysfunction correlates with increased ischemia-induced cytosolic calcium accumulation. Magnesium-supplemented potassium cardioplegia ameliorates this age-related phenomenon at normothermia and may have important implications in myocardial protection in the elderly population.

Control hearts were perfused at 37 Â° C for 180 minutes; global ischemic hearts received 30 minutes of <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and 120 minutes of reperfusion; magnesium-supplemented potassium cardioplegic hearts received cardioplegia 5 minutes before global ischemia; ischemic preconditioned hearts received 5 minutes of zero-flow <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and 5 minutes of reperfusion before global ischemia; adenosine-enhanced ischemic preconditioned hearts received a bolus injection of adenosine just before the preconditioning. To separate the effects of adenosine from adenosine-enhanced ischemic preconditioning, a control group received a bolus injection of adenosine 10 minutes before <b>global</b> <b>ischemia.</b> Results: Infarct volume in global ischemic hearts was 32. 9 % Â± 5. 1 % and 1. 03 % Â± 0. 3 % in control hearts. The infarct volume decreased (10. 23 % Â± 2. 6 % and 7. 0 % Â± 1. 6 %, respectively; pÂ < 0. 001 versus <b>global</b> <b>ischemia)</b> in the ischemic preconditioned group and control group, but this did not enhance postischemic functional recovery. Magnesium-supplemented potassium cardioplegia and adenosine-enhanced ischemic preconditioning significantly decreased infarct volume (2. 9 % Â± 0. 8 % and 2. 8 % Â± 0. 55 %, respectively; pÂ < 0. 001 versus <b>global</b> <b>ischemia,</b> pÂ = 0. 02 versus ischemic preconditioning and pÂ = 0. 05 versus control group) and significantly enhanced postischemic functional recovery. Conclusions: Adenosine-enhanced ischemic preconditioning is superior to ischemic preconditioning and provides equal protection to that afforded by magnesium-supplemented potassium cardioplegia.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{production}} by endothelial {{nitric oxide synthase}} (eNOS) plays a protective role in cerebral ischemia by maintaining vascular permeability, whereas NO derived from neuronal and inducible NOS is neurotoxic and can participate in neuronal damage occurring in ischemia. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are up-regulated by ischemic injury and degrade the basement membrane if brain vessels to promote cell death and tissue injury. We previously reported that agmatine, synthesized from L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) which is expressed in endothelial cells, has shown a direct increased eNOS expression and decreased MMPs expression in bEnd 3 cells. But, there are few reports about the regulation of eNOS by agmatine in ischemic animal model. In the present study, we examined the expression of eNOS and MMPs by agmatine treatment after transient <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> in vivo. <b>Global</b> <b>ischemia</b> was induced with four vessel occlusion (4 -VO) and agmatine (100 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally {{at the onset of}} reperfusion. The animals were euthanized at 6 and 24 hours after <b>global</b> <b>ischemia</b> and prepared for other analysis. <b>Global</b> <b>ischemia</b> led severe neuronal damage in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but agmatine treatment protected neurons from ischemic injury. Moreover, the level and expression of eNOS was increased by agmatine treatment, whereas inducible NOS (iNOS) and MMP- 9 protein expressions were decreased in the brain. These results suggest that agmatine protects microvessels in the brain by activation eNOS as well as reduces extracellular matrix degradation during the early phase of ischemic insult...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic postconditioning renders {{brain tissue}} {{tolerant}} to brain ischemia, thereby alleviating ischemic brain injury. However, the exact {{mechanism of action}} is still unclear. In this study, a rat model of <b>global</b> brain <b>ischemia</b> was subjected to ischemic postconditioning treatment using the vessel occlusion method. After 2 hours of ischemia, the bilateral common carotid arteries were blocked immediately for 10 seconds and then perfused for 10 seconds. This procedure was repeated six times. Ischemic postconditioning was found to mitigate hippocampal CA 1 neuronal damage in rats with brain ischemia, and up-regulate acid-sensing ion channel 2 a expression at the mRNA and protein level. These findings suggest that ischemic postconditioning up-regulates acid-sensing ion channel 2 a expression in the rat hippocampus after <b>global</b> brain <b>ischemia,</b> which promotes neuronal tolerance to ischemic brain injury...|$|R

METHODS: Based on the quantitative analysis of EEG using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), {{the effect of}} Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on rat EEG was surveyed in the model of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and <b>global</b> cerebral <b>ischemia.</b> RESULTS: In the <b>global</b> cerebral <b>ischemia,</b> GbE 8 and 16 mg/kg could accelerate the recovery of EEG after reperfusion, and GbE 4 mg/kg had the same effect but much weaker. In the MCA occlusion model, GbE 16 and 32 mg/kg greatly suppressed the drop of power spectrum of EEG. CONCLUSION: GbE could mitigate the cerebral damage caused by ischemia...|$|R
40|$|The third {{meeting of}} the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology working group was convened in Lund, Sweden, in June 2010 to {{consider}} the key clinical challenge of developing electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for identification of the <b>global</b> subendocardial <b>ischemia</b> that results from subtotal occlusion of either the left main coronary artery or its equivalent. The participants considered the specific abnormalities typical of <b>global</b> subendocardial <b>ischemia</b> on the presenting ECG and outlined further studies to establish the optimal quantitative ECG criteria. Subgroups on Electrocardiology, Myocardial Imaging, and Coronary Intervention met separately to establish priorities on their topic and then joined together in a final session of the entire working group. The principles for a retrospective and then a prospective study were identified, and a writing group was formed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
