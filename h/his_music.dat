5|$|Another major 20th-century {{composer}} {{who engaged}} Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised {{him as a}} fine conductor of <b>his</b> <b>music</b> (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted <b>his</b> <b>music).</b> In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.|$|E
5|$|Beck has an irreverent {{style of}} sampling, often using such sources as obscure films to splice {{together}} cuts of people {{talking in the}} background of <b>his</b> <b>music,</b> or various other found sounds to create sound collages {{in the background of}} <b>his</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} two decades of his life, Josquin's fame spread abroad along with <b>his</b> <b>music.</b> The newly {{developed}} technology of printing made wide dissemination of <b>his</b> <b>music</b> possible, and Josquin was the favorite of the first printers: one of Petrucci's first publications, and the earliest surviving print of music by a single composer, was a book of Josquin's masses which he printed in Venice in 1502. This publication was successful enough that Petrucci published two further volumes of Josquin's masses, in 1504 and 1514, and reissued them several times.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, {{and more like}} the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis.

50|$|Charles Dodge (b. Ames, Iowa, June 5, 1942) is an American {{composer}} {{best known}} for <b>his</b> electronic <b>music,</b> specifically <b>his</b> computer <b>music.</b> He is {{a former student of}} Darius Milhaud and Gunther Schuller.|$|R

50|$|Much of <b>his</b> <b>music's</b> lyrical content has {{revolved}} around the subject of romantic love, though themes of profound joy, reminiscence, gratitude and deeper spiritual aspects {{of the human condition}} have become predominant in recent years.|$|R
5|$|He found birdsong fascinating, notating bird songs {{worldwide}} and incorporating birdsong transcriptions into <b>his</b> <b>music.</b> His innovative use of colour, {{his conception of}} the relationship between time and music, and his use of birdsong are among the features that make Messiaen's music distinctive.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>music</b> became {{immensely popular}} in Italy and France {{for more than}} a hundred years, with his first book of madrigals being reprinted fifty-eight times by 1654, and <b>his</b> <b>music</b> {{appearing}} in innumerable intabulations for instruments such as the lute, guitar, and viol. Additional hints to his popularity are the frequency with which anonymous compositions were attributed to him, and the appearance of <b>his</b> <b>music</b> in several paintings of musicians from the time. Likely his popularity was due to his gift for capturing the Italian spirit and marrying it with the technical perfection of the Franco-Flemish harmonic and polyphonic style; in addition he wrote catchy tunes which were easy to sing. Unlike later generations of madrigal composers, Arcadelt did not expect professional singers to be the only consumers of his work; anyone who could read notes could sing his madrigals.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used <b>his</b> <b>music</b> in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize <b>his</b> <b>music</b> by word of mouth.|$|E

5000|$|In Mozart and his Operas (University of California Press, 2006) Cairns stated part of <b>his</b> <b>music's</b> {{appeal was}} its {{simultaneous}} embodiment of both [...] "the perfection our souls long {{for and the}} sensation of our longing".|$|R
5|$|Ketèlbey's {{popularity}} {{began to}} wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; {{many of his}} post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found <b>his</b> <b>music</b> ignored by the BBC. In 1949 {{he moved to the}} Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes, Bells Across the Meadows was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time and the last night of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death—the first time <b>his</b> <b>music</b> had been included in the festival's finale.|$|E
5|$|Olivier Messiaen {{often used}} birdsong as an {{inspiration}} for <b>his</b> <b>music,</b> and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie, Catalogue d'oiseaux, La fauvette des jardins and Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, appearing in four movements of the last piece.|$|E

50|$|He wrote constantly, as {{he could}} feel himself getting weaker.

Copernicus was a masterpiece of all <b>his</b> talents, <b>music,</b> composition, writing, comedy, love, life and death.|$|R

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for <b>his</b> <b>music.</b> This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated <b>his</b> <b>music</b> into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas early Brighter Death Now {{recordings}} {{tended to}} be largely instrumental and atmospherically oriented, present-day releases often feature screamed vocals, distorted beyond comprehension.
