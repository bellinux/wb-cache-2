50|$|John Sigismund's most {{significant}} action was his conversion from Lutheranism to Calvinism, {{after he had}} earlier equalized the rights of Catholics and Protestants in the Duchy of Prussia {{under pressure from the}} King of Poland.

The vast majority of his subjects in Brandenburg, <b>including</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Anna <b>of</b> Prussia, remained deeply Lutheran, however. After the Elector and his Calvinist court officials drew up plans for mass conversion of the population to the new faith in February 1614, as provided for by the rule of Cuius regio, eius religio within the Holy Roman Empire, there were serious protests, with <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> backing the Lutherans. Resistance was so strong that in 1615, John Sigismund backed down and relinquished all attempts at forcible conversion. Instead, he allowed his subjects to be either Lutheran or Calvinist according to the dictates of their own consciences. Henceforward, Brandenburg-Prussia would be a bi-confessional state.|$|R
