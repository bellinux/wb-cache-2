The statue of José de San Martín, in Parque de Mayo, the sculpture group of Lola Mora in the fountain at the front of Universidad del Sur, the memorial to Giuseppe Garibaldi, the statue of Isabel I of Castile in front of the bus station, donated by the Government of Spain (no such pieces are donated to non capital cities as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> case, enhancing the importance of the local Spanish descendants), the pieces which decorate the frontispieces of Banco de la Nación, Edificio Banco Provincia, {{to the side of the}} City Hall, Saint George and the Dragon of the former electrical power plant of Ingeniero White in the Port, the ones of the former building of La Nueva Provincia and those of the Cathedral are unique, as well as the modern art ones which form the group of Paseo de las Esculturas, indeed remarkable. Although not a sculpture, the mural mosaic of Colegio Don Bosco, on the corner of Vieytes and Moreno streets, by Aurelio Friedrich -a local plastic artist- is to be mentioned. All of them do enrich the architectural, artistic and cultural patrimony and heritage of the City.|$|E

500|$|The apocalyptic wartime {{setting and}} the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash {{of the atomic}} bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg {{powerful}} visual metaphors [...] "to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy's innocence {{and the death of}} the innocence of the entire world." [...] Spielberg reflected he [...] "was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an attenuation of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody's impression of me is what my life <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> <b>This</b> was the opposite of Peter Pan.

[...] Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in Empire of the Sun, include a child being separated from his parents (The Sugarland Express, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist) and World War II (1941, and Raiders of the Lost Ark).

500|$|The Independent places {{emphasis}} on the comparisons between the story that evolves in Quicksilver and Stephenson's earlier novel Cryptonomicon, with the former [...] "shaping {{up to be a}} far more impressive literary endeavour than most so-called 'serious' fiction. And it ends on a hell of a cliffhanger. No scholarly, and intellectually provocative, historical novel <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>this</b> much fun since The Name of the Rose". Patrick Ness considers Quicksilver to be [...] "entertaining over an impossible distance. This isn't a book; it's a place to move into and raise a family." [...] His review focuses on the scope of the material and humour inherent in Quicksilver. Mark Sanderson calls the novel an [...] "astonishing achievement", and compares Quicksilver to [...] "Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon and Lawrence Norfolk's Lempriere's Dictionary." [...] Although full of historical description and incredibly lengthy, Quicksilver is noticeably full of what Sanderson called [...] "more sex and violence... than any Tarantino movie". Stephenson balances his desire to respect the period with a need to develop a novel which entertains modern readers.|$|E
