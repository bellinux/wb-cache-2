A phosphorothioate antisense drug named <b>fomivirsen</b> has been introduced, used to treat opportunistic eye infections in AIDS patients caused by cytomegalovirus, and other antisense antivirals are in development.

5000|$|The {{antisense}} field {{anticipated that}} the approval of <b>fomivirsen</b> {{marked the beginning of}} a new age of antisense drug treatments, that would be similar to the uptake of monoclonal antibody therapy, but the next FDA approval of an antisense drug came in 2013. [...] Part of what held up Isis and other companies in the field, was the way that the oligomers were chemically treated to make them into drugs which prevented some hydrolysis but also reduced affinity to the antisense molecules' targets; around 2004 the field was shifting to second generation modifications. [...] Clinical trials of antisense therapeutics by Isis and others in the early 2000s were also plagued by lack of efficacy and immune reactions to drug candidates. Isis had to cut its workforce by 40% in 2005 due to weak sales of <b>fomivirsen</b> and lack of confidence by the market in antisense technology.|$|E

5000|$|Henk Buck never {{accepted}} {{the outcome of}} this controversy. Up to this day he persists in his opinion that he could produce sufficiently pure phosphate methylated DNA.

To this day, however, nobody produced pure phosphate methylated DNA strands in the quality Goudsmit required. All the efforts from Miller, Van Boeckel and Buck resulted in short instable fragments. Recent researches in this field are based on methyl phosphonate or phosphorothioate DNA. At present (2008) only one antisense medication exists, based on phosphorothioate oligonucleotide: <b>Fomivirsen.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Fomivirsen</b> is a 21 -nucleotide {{phosphorothioate}} oligonucleotide which, when {{injected into}} a human eye, {{is capable of}} inhibiting CMV retinitis. Its mode of action is consistent with an antisense mechanism. Prior to human trials, <b>fomivirsen</b> was tested {{in a number of}} in vitro cell lines and was found to inhibit CMV replication in a dose-dependent manner with a mean 50 % inhibitory concentration between 0. 03 and 0. 2 microM. Intravitreal drug clearance studies have revealed first-order kinetics with a half-life in the rabbit of 62 hours. In a clinical trial of patients with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis receiving 165 mg per injection, time to progression was interpolated to 71 days with 44 % of the patients remaining on treatment for over one year. In patients who failed other anti-CMV treatments, the interpolated time to progression was 91 days when receiving 330 mg per injection. No systemic absorption of the drug could be detected. Reported adverse events have been for the most part mild to moderate in intensity and either resolved spontaneously or were treatable with topical medications.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{infections are}} usually benign and self-limiting in the immunocompetent population; however, HCMV is a well-recognized problem among immunocompromised patients (in particular immunosuppressed patients with stem cell or solid organ transplantation, AIDS, or cancer). In {{this group of}} patients, HCMV infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, congenital HCMV infections are {{a leading cause of}} birth defects and infections in children, occurring in 1 to 2 % of all live births. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HCMV diseases in the immunocompromised host include ganciclovir (GCV), its oral prodrug valganciclovir (VGCV), cidofovir (CDV), foscavir (FOS), and <b>fomivirsen.</b> Except for <b>fomivirsen,</b> all these drugs are targeted at the viral DNA polymerase. Even if presently approved anti-HCMV drugs have considerable helped in the management of HCMV disease in the immunocompromised host, their use is limited due to questions of toxicity, poor oral bioavailability, modest efficacy, and development of virus-drug resistance. Furthermore, no drug has been licensed to treat congenital HCMV. For these reasons, there is a real need to develop new compounds active against HCMV. The search for novel inhibitors of HCMV replication has led to the identification of new molecular viral targets such as the protein kinase UL 97 and proteins involved in genome replication or in viral maturation and egress. Moreover, a new strategy based on the identification of specific cellular targets required for viral replication has been developed. This review will focus on new compounds that inhibit a specific viral process (viral targets) and on cell-based approaches (cellular targets) that result in selective inhibition of virus replication. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{infection is}} associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, in particular transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent congenital viral infection in humans.

Fortunately, there are several novel and potentially very effective new compounds which are under pre-clinical and clinical evaluation and may address these limitations.

40|$|The antiherpes drugs, {{aciclovir}} and ganciclovir, {{are considered}} the standard treatments and prophylactic agents for infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Until a decade ago, the impact of aciclovir on the control of severe and life-threatening herpesvirus infections was unprecedented. During the past few years, we have witnessed approval of new therapeutic drugs for infections caused by HSV and VZV (i. e. penciclovir and the oral prodrugs, valaciclovir and famciclovir), CMV (i. e. ganciclovir, cidofovir and <b>fomivirsen)</b> or HSV, VZV and CMV (i. e. foscarnet). A few agents, such as brivudin and benzimidavir, are in ongoing clinical development; others have been suspended because of safety concerns. New antiherpes agents are needed to face clinical issues such as drug resistance, increased use of antiherpes prophylaxis in transplantation and safety concerns in small children or pregnant women. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Under {{clinical}} development {{since the}} early 90 ’s and with two successfully approved drugs (<b>Fomivirsen</b> and Mipomersen), oligonucleotide-based therapeutics have not yet delivered a clinical drug to {{the market in the}} cancer field. Whilst many pre-clinical data has been generated, a lack of understanding still exists on how to efficiently tackle all the different challenges presented for cancer targeting in a clinical setting. Namely, effective drug vectorization, careful choice of target gene or synergistic multi-gene targeting are surely decisive, while caution must be exerted to avoid potential toxic, often misleading off-target-effects. Here a brief overview will be given on the nucleic acid chemistry advances that established oligonucleotide technologies as a promising therapeutic alternative and ongoing cancer related clinical trials. Special attention will be given towards a perspective on the hurdles encountered specifically in the cancer field by this class of therapeutic oligonucleotides and a view on possible avenues for success is presented, with particular focus on the contribution from nanotechnology to the field...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} intravitreal injections {{require the}} care and judgment of a medically trained physician experienced in diagnosing and treating retinal diseases as well as potential complications, which may necessitate surgical intervention. The Academy strongly supports the position that all intravitreal injections should be performed only by Eye M. D. s (licensed MDs or DOs). Background: Intravitreal injections of air were first used in 1911 {{for the purpose of}} repairing retinal detachments. 1 Since that time, intravitreal injections have been used for treatment of a variety of conditions, including endophthalmitis, intraocular lymphoma, cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, submacular hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The primary benefit of intravitreal injection is that the therapeutic agent is targeted in the eye while minimizing systemic absorption. In 1998, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the first agent for intravitreal injections, <b>fomivirsen</b> sodium (Vitravene; Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA), for the treatment of CMV retinitis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{infection}} {{is one of}} the most important infectious complications of solid-organ transplantation, a serious, life-threatining, opportunistic pathogen in HIV-infected patients, and may cause hearing defects and irreversible central nervous system disease in infants infected during gestation. Four drugs are currently licensed for prophylaxis, pre-emptive therapy, and treatment of CMV infection- ganciclovir, and its oral prodrug valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, and <b>fomivirsen.</b> All four drugs are effective against CMV infection. Toxicities, drug-drug interactions, poor bioaailibility, and the development of drug resistance, however, are clinically relevant and common limitations of these drugs. Novel compounds are on the horizon that possibly will become useful alternatives to currently licensed drugs. Maribavir, a benzimidazol, is the most promising novel drug and closest to clinical application. Several phase II clinical trials proved its good tolerability and effectivity. Other compounds are currently evaluated in pre-clinical and phase I trials with promising preliminary data. In addition, analogs of cidofovir posess significantly improved pharmacological and virological characteristics allowing their oral administration. This review summarizes the current status in drug development and will introduce the most recent patents on this line of research...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemotherapy}} {{of virus}} infections has definitely come of age. There are now 15 antiviral agents {{that have been}} formally licensed {{for the treatment of}} human immunodeficiency virus infections (zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir) and several others, such as tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine, capravirine, emivirine, T- 20 (pentafuside) and AMD 3100 (bicyclam) are under clinical development. Lamivudine has been approved, and several other compounds (such as adefovir dipivoxil, emtricitabine and entecavir) are under clinical development, for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infections. Among the anti-herpesvirus agents, aciclovir, valaciclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, idoxuridine, trifluridine and brivudin are used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections, and ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, <b>fomivirsen</b> and maribavir (the latter in the developmental stage) are used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infections. Following amantadine and rimantadine, the neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, have now become available for the therapy and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections, and so is ribavirin for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections and the combination of ribavirin with interferon-alpha for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infections. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The current armamentarium for the {{chemotherapy}} of viral infections {{consists of}} 37 licensed antiviral drugs. For {{the treatment of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, 19 compounds have been formally approved: (i) the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine; (ii) the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; (iii) the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz; (iv) the protease inhibitors saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir (combined with ritonavir at a 4 / 1 ratio) and atazanavir; and the viral entry inhibitor enfuvirtide. For the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, lamivudine as well as adefovir dipivoxil have been approved. Among the anti-herpesvirus agents, acyclovir, valaciclovir, penciclovir (when applied topically), famciclovir, idoxuridine and trifluridine (both applied topically) as well as brivudin {{are used in the}} treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and/or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections; and ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir and <b>fomivirsen</b> (the latter upon intravitreal injection) have proven useful in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in immunosuppressed patients (i. e.

40|$|Most viral diseases, {{with the}} {{exception}} of those caused by human immunodeficiency virus, are self-limited illnesses that do not require specific antiviral therapy. The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule <b>fomivirsen,</b> all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M 2 protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-α and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t) ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti–human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M 2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. This article provides an overview of clinically available antiviral drugs for the primary care physician, with a special focus on pharmacology, clinical uses, and adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is {{a significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in immunocompromised popula-tions (Alford & Britt, 1993). There are currently three nucleoside analogues available in the USA as drugs for the treatment of HCMV infection: ganciclovir (GCV), foscar-net and cidofovir (Crumpacker, 1996; Hitchcock et al., 1996, Chrisp & Clissold, 1991). In addition, the antisense oligonucleotide <b>fomivirsen</b> has been approved for direct treatment of HCMV retinitis (Mulamba et al., 1998; Perry & Balfour, 1999). However, use of these drugs is limited by low oral bioavailability, in vivo toxicity, inconvenient administration methods and the development of resistance (Field & Biron, 1994). These deficiencies demonstrate the need for new compounds to treat HCMV infections. We have reported that 2, 5, 6 -trichloro-(1 -β-D-ribofura-nosyl) benzimidazole (TCRB) and the 2 -bromo analogue, BDCRB, are potent and selective inhibitors of HCMV (Townsend et al., 1995). The benzimidazole ribonucleo-sides have a unique mode of action in that there is no effect on the synthesis of viral DNA (Underwood et al., 1998). Instead, these compounds inhibit the cleavage of high molecular weight, concatemeric viral DNA to monomeric genome-length units (Underwood et al., 1998). Benzimidazole ribonucleoside-resistant mutants of HCMV have been independently isolated from HCMV strains AD 169 and Towne. In studies with AD 169, 10 -fold resistance resulted from single mutations in the UL 89 open reading frame (ORF) (Asp 344 Glu or Ala 355 Thr), and 30 -fold resistance resulted from a combination of both the position 344 and 355 mutations in UL 89 (Underwood et al., 1998). In studies with Towne, a resistant mutant was identified (isolate C 4) that was ~ 30 -fold resistant to the benzimidazole ribonucleosides. This isolate had mutations in both the UL 89 and UL 56 ORFs (UL 89, Asp 344 Glu and UL 56, Gln 204 Arg) (Krosky et al., 1998). Either of these mutations alone caused 10 -fold resistance, but both were required for the higher level of resistance. The HSV- 1 homologues of UL 89 and UL 56 (UL 15 and UL 28, respectively) code for essential proteins that are required for viral DNA cleavage and packaging (Poon & Roizman...|$|E
