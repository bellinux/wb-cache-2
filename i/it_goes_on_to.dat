5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a discussion of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E

After an {{intersection}} with Old Creedmoor Road, NC 98 and NC 50 have a cloverleaf interchange. Continuing to the east, the road intersects Six Forks and New Light Roads, before once again crossing over Falls Lake. After passing by several neighborhoods and crossing over Falls Lake two more times, the road intersects Thompson Mill Road, where it widens from a two lane road to a four lane divided highway.

25|$|The Testament of Judah is {{primarily}} concerned with courage, monetary greed, and fornication.

25|$|Indeed, {{the very}} {{title of the}} Malleus Maleficarum is feminine, {{alluding}} {{to the idea that}} it was women who were the villains. Otherwise, it would be the Malleus Maleficorum (the masculine form of the Latin noun maleficus or malefica, 'witch'). In Latin, the feminine maleficarum would only be used for women, while the masculine maleficorum could be used for men alone or for both sexes if together. The Malleus Maleficarum accuses male and female witches of infanticide, cannibalism and casting evil spells to harm their enemies as well as having the power to steal a man's penis. <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> give accounts of witches committing these crimes.|$|E
25|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} is {{a mathematical}} system {{attributed to the}} Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the Elements. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid {{was the first to}} show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The Elements begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the Elements states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.|$|E
25|$|In the colony, {{the queen}} is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} foraging for the nest until workers mature. This includes foraging for wood to make into pulp for the nest as well as food for the larvae. Most workers begin to help with foraging the day after they emerge from the nest as adults. Almost immediately, they take over all foraging activity for the queen. The behavior of the workers who forage differs depending on their activity. Those trying to catch flies move quickly from one flower head to the next and pounce on prey when it is found. In comparison, wasps that forage for nectar move slower and spend more time at each flower. Other workers collect pulp from dead wood to use for nest construction. It appears that if the wasp is unable to quickly catch a fly <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> collect nectar suggesting one worker does not always collect the same type of material. Different amounts of time are given to each activity with the most time spent gathering fluid, then pulp, and then flies. Foraging takes place from roughly sunrise to sunset of each day in order {{to keep up with the}} resources needed for the colony.|$|E

500|$|In late 1847, Marx and Engels {{began writing}} {{what was to}} become their most famous work — a {{programme}} of action for the Communist League. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, The Communist Manifesto was first published on 21 February 1848. The Communist Manifesto laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing. The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: [...] "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy capitalist class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the Manifesto presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting {{in the interests of the}} proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.|$|E

An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion {{of the terms of}} a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were {{likely to be able to}} influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that [...] "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." [...] <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> say that Slavkov received [...] "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" [...] and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services.
