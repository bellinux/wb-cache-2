2500|$|The 13mm {{centerfire}} [...] Reffye mitrailleuse cartridges {{were loaded}} into interchangeable steel breech blocks (unlike the Montigny mitrailleuse whose ammunition {{was held by}} the cartridge base in plates). When firing the mitrailleuse, three breech blocks were kept in continuous use: one being fired, one being pressed down on the extractor and one being loaded from a single pre-packaged 25-round box. Adjusting the elevation of the mitrailleuse in accordance to {{the distance to the}} designated target was performed with an <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> identical to that on a regular artillery piece. The mitrailleuse's barrel could also be moved sideways while firing, to the right and left, in order to adjust for range and provide lateral sweeping fire if needed. The lateral sweep was narrow, however, thus most effective at far distances only. The weapon's field of fire was so narrow that Prussian soldiers were often hit by several bullets at once. During an early engagement of the Franco-Prussian War, at Forbach in Alsace on August 6, 1870, a Prussian general officer (General Bruno von François) was brought down by a very closely spaced volley of four bullets. According to the Prussian regimental record, those four mitrailleuse bullets had been fired from 600meters away. French artillery attempted to rectify this problem by developing special ammunition capable of firing three bullets from the same cartridge for short-range point-defence.|$|E

As the decks of contemporary ships curved upwards towards the stern and bows, he cut down the wheels on the [...] "up-slope" [...] side of each cannon's carriage in order that all guns were level with the horizon. He also introduced a system where bearings were incised into the deck next to each gun; fire could then be directed to any bearing independent of the ability of any particular gun crew to see the target. Fire from the whole battery could also be focused on any part of an enemy ship.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the lessons}} learned at the Battle of Austerlitz, where Russian {{artillery}} had performed poorly, Arakcheyev devised the [...] "System of 1805". Under this arrangement, 6- and 12-pounder guns were employed throughout the army, as well as 2-, 10-, and 18-pounder licornes. Under the new system, a single Russian division had as much artillery as an entire French corps. A foot artillery battalion was composed of two light and two heavy companies. A light foot artillery company consisted of four 10-pounder licornes, four light and four medium 6-pounder guns; a heavy artillery company had four light and four heavy 12-pounder guns and four 18- and two 2-pounder licornes. Six light 6-pounder guns and six 10-pounder licornes made a company of horse artillery. Licornes were usually deployed on the flanks of the batteries. All these guns used a <b>screw</b> <b>elevating</b> mechanism instead of the old system of wedges and had an improved sighting apparatus.|$|R
40|$|Multiscale {{materials}} modeling {{has emerged}} {{in recent years as}} a significant concept and the only viable approach to understand the mechanical response of materials by linking modeling research at different length scales and time scales, including quantum mechanics, atomistics modeling, mesoscale modeling and continuum modeling together. The role that atomistic modeling plays is important and indispensable in that it can generate understanding of the physics and pass this mechanistic understanding as well as important parameters to higher level simulations. This thesis presents theories and simulations of defect nucleation and mobility in BCC transition metal molybdenum using atomistic methods, with the two primary defects of interest being dislocations and deformation twinning, and emphasis on the atomistic mechanisms and measures. The contributions presented in the thesis may be regarded as advances in both methods development and mechanistic understanding of dislocation mobility and twinning nucleation. For atomistic studies of dislocations in a simulation cell of finite size, new methods have been derived to (1) calculate the atomic displacement field under PBC and generate atomic dislocation configuration from this displacement field; (2) quantify artificial image effect for a dislocation moving within the periodic cell and optimize geometry of simulation cell to minimize such effects. These methodological breakthroughs {{serve as the basis for}} atomistic studies of dislocations and are used repeatedly in this thesis. To understand the complex plasticity behavior of BCC metal molybdenum, we need to first understand the most fundamental problem of core structure(cont.) and lattice resistance of straight dislocations before considering more complicated structures including kinks, jogs, junctions, etc. In this thesis, we examine the two major types of dislocations that are of primary interest in BCC molybdenum: screw dislocations, which is the major plasticity carrier at low temperatures, and edge dislocations, which become important at <b>elevated</b> temperatures. For <b>screw</b> dislocations, the issue of whether core is polarized or not is explored by a static calculation of core structure for the first time by a tight-binding potential. The screw core structure is determined to be non-polarized; however, the magnitude of Peierls stress, which is a measure of the lattice resistance to dislocation motion and is calculated accurately using a local-driving-force method in this thesis, remains rather high despite of the non-polarized core, suggesting that core polarization is a secondary and less important effect compared to core planarity. For edge dislocations in molybdenum, the core structure and Peierls stress is calculated using a Finnis-Sinclair potential and it is shown that edge dislocation in Mo has a planar core structure and a core width of approximately 11 [angstroms], is indeed very mobile and has a Peierls stress of only 25 MPa, after correction for image effects due to boundary conditions. This new result is consistent with experimental observations of high mobility of edge dislocations and clearly rejects the proposal of kink mechanisms operating on edge dislocations that arose in the literature as a result of previous inaccurate Peierls stress calculations yielding an unrealistically high value of 700 MPa [...] . by Jinpeng Chang.

5000|$|Thirty-two-pounder gun of 4500 {{pounds and}} VIII-inch Dahlgren shell gun: 383 of the 32-pounders [...] and 355 of the VIII-inch Dahlgren were cast by Alger Builders, Fort Pitt Foundry, and Seyfert, McManus & Co. between 1864 and 1867. The 32-pounder had {{a crew of}} 10 and a powder-boy while the VIII-inch had a crew of 12 and a powder-boy. Some have argued that these guns are not Dahlgren designs, {{pointing}} out that while the guns generally resemble his designs, these guns used old-style breeching jaws instead of the breech loop found on other Dahlgrens {{and that there is}} no <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> running through the cascabel [...] It is also asserted that the guns would have to be elevated by quoins. This is not accurate, particularly for the VIII-inch Dahlgren, as a new iron carriage with an <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> beneath the breech of the gun was developed for VIII-inch [...] and other carriages with breech elevating screws were also used [...] It is also argued that the bores were too small for their late introduction and very few saw service during or after the American Civil War. These guns would most likely have been intended for small riverine and estuarine gunboats, which the navy scrapped as quickly as possible after the war. The documentary evidence also supports a conclusion that these two guns should be considered to be Dahlgen designs. In Mrs. Dahlgren’s petition to the national government for compensation for the use of Admiral Dahlgren's inventions, both the 32-pounder gun of 4500 pounds and VIII-inch shell gun are specifically described as designs of Admiral Dahlgren [...] Also, in February 1867, Cyrus Alger paid a royalty on the Dahlgren patent for production of “ten eight-inch guns weighing 64,270, $642.70.” [...] There {{can be little doubt that}} both of these guns should be credited as Dahlgren designs.|$|E
5000|$|The 4.2-inch (30-pounder) rifles {{were the}} most widely used of the Parrott siege guns. The tubes were mounted on a {{conventional}} siege carriage.

The 4.2-inch Parrott rifles did not have as great a propensity for bursting as found in the larger Parrott rifles. During the siege of Petersburg 44 4.2-inch Parrott rifles fired 12,209 rounds , but only one gun burst when a shell detonated before clearing the muzzle [...] One 4.2-inch Parrott rifle also burst during the campaign against Charleston harbor, but only after it had fired 4,606 rounds [...]|$|E
5000|$|During the Mexican-American War the U.S. {{found itself}} lacking in light guns {{that could be}} fired from ships’ boats and landed {{to be used as}} light {{artillery}} in support of landing parties [...] Light artillery borrowed from the army proved unsatisfactory. In 1849, then lieutenant, Dahlgren began to design a family of smoothbore muzzle-loading boat howitzers that could be mounted in ships’ launches and cutters as well as being mounted onto field carriages. The first boat howitzers to be designed were a light 12-pounder, a heavy 12-pounder (originally designated a medium), and a 24-pounder. Later a lighter 12-pounder (the small) and a rifled 12-pounder heavy howitzer were introduced. All of the boat howitzers were very similar in design, cast in bronze, with a mounting lug or loop {{on the bottom of the}} barrel instead of trunnions, and an <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> running through the cascabel. Having the single mounting lug expedited moving the howitzer from the launch to field carriage and back. In naval service the boat howitzers had gun crews of 10 in the boat and 11 ashore.|$|E

50|$|The SBBL 32 pounder was a smooth-bore breech loading gun made by {{converting}} older 32 pounder 42 cwt smooth-bore muzzle-loading guns. The guns {{chosen for}} conversion were Monk Pattern guns of 42 cwt, a lighter and shorter variant of muzzle loader. The cascabel {{of the gun}} was cut off and a double action breech block was fitted. A new vent was drilled {{in front of the}} breech mechanism, as the guns were designed to be fired with short friction tubes, the standard means of ignition for artillery pieces at the time.The conversion was first suggested in 1879 to enable guns fitted in the flank defence of fortifications to be fired much more rapidly. They were used in caponiers to provide flanking fire to fortifications. In this role their targets would have been personnel entering ditches, and the guns were designed to fire case shot only, with ranges of up to about 500 yards. Because {{of the nature of the}} conversion, and the type of ammunition, a service charge of 3lb of black powder was used, as opposed to around three times that amount for a conventional 32-pounder muzzle loading gun.The guns were only ever mounted on one type of carriage. It was an iron sliding carriage and platform, which enabled the gun to be traversed left and right, as well as run back for storage. The slide also acted to absorb recoil from the gun when it was fired. An <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> and wooden elevating wedge (or Quoin) was also provided, to enable the gun to be elevated or depressed.|$|E
50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the <b>elevating</b> <b>screw</b> housing by a clevis joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when firing zone charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|E
