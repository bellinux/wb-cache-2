25|$|Hungary's {{transition}} to a Western-style democracy {{was one of the}} smoothest among the former Soviet bloc. By late 1988, activists within the party and bureaucracy and Budapest-based intellectuals were increasing pressure for change. Some of these became reform socialists, while others began movements which were to develop into parties. Young liberals formed the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz); a core from the so-called Democratic Opposition formed the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), and the national opposition established the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum</b> (MDF). Civic activism intensified to a level not seen since the 1956 revolution.|$|E
25|$|Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, {{persuaded the}} regime to begin {{negotiations}} with the emergent non-Communist political forces. Round Table talks began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces Fidesz, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SzDSz), the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum</b> (MDF), the Independent Smallholders' Party, the Hungarian People's Party, the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) were invited. It was at the talks {{that a number of}} Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including László Sólyom, József Antall, György Szabad, Péter Tölgyessy and Viktor Orbán.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first free}} {{parliamentary}} election, held in May 1990, was effectively a plebiscite on communism. The revitalized and reformed Communists performed poorly despite {{having more than}} the usual advantages of an [...] "incumbent" [...] party. Populist, center-right, and liberal parties fared best, with the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum</b> (MDF) winning 43% of the vote and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) capturing 24%. Under Prime Minister József Antall, the MDF formed a center-right coalition government with the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) to command a 60% majority in the parliament. Parliamentary opposition parties included SZDSZ, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), and the Alliance of Young Democrats (Fidesz).|$|E
50|$|Bokros' {{nomination}} {{indicated a}} change of political position from conservative to liberal ideology. As a result, several prominent members left the party, including Péter Olajos, Kálmán Katona and former Prime Minister Péter Boross.

50|$|Tamás Katona (February 2, 1932 - June 28, 2013) was a Hungarian historian, academic, politician, {{who served}} as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1992 and as Mayor of Budavár (1st {{district}} of Budapest) between 1994 and 1998. Besides that he represented Vác (Pest County Constituency II) in the National Assembly of Hungary from 1990 to 1994, and functioned as MP from the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum's</b> Pest County Regional List between 1994 and 1998.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Hungary {{after the end}} of Communism in 1990. He was elected Member of Parliament from the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum's</b> Budapest Regional List in the 1990 parliamentary election. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Budget, Tax and Finance from May 3, 1990 and December 21, 1990. He was {{also a member of the}} Committee on European Community Affairs since June 23, 1992 and the Committee on Human Rights, Minorities and Religious Affairs since June 15, 1993.|$|R
2500|$|Hungary's {{transition}} from communism {{to democracy and}} capitalism (rendszerváltás, [...] "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other Warsaw Pact countries. Although the MSzMP began Round Table Talks with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held in May 1990, which saw the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum,</b> a major conservative opposition group, elected {{to the head of}} a coalition government. József Antall became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.|$|E
2500|$|People or {{parties that}} were rumoured to be {{possible}} partners in the new group included Law and Justice; Lega Nord; the Danish People's Party; For Fatherland and Freedom, Order and Justice, the Pensioners' Party; Order, Law and Justice; Libertas; Civic Union; Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, ChristianUnion-SGP; the independent Indrek Tarand; and Lijst Dedecker's Derk Jan Eppink; from member states such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Italy, Sweden, the Baltic and Balkan states, Belgium, and the Netherlands. [...] Speculation also considered {{the remnants of the}} Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) group, which was thought {{to be on the verge}} of collapse after the decision of Fianna Fáil to join the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and the Italian National Alliance merging with EPP member party Forza Italia. Lajos Bokros, elected on the list of the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum</b> (MDF) joined the group as the EPP did not want to accept him on pressure of the rival FIDESZ.|$|E

5000|$|Fidesz's {{position}} on the political spectrum has changed over time. At its inception as a student movement in the late-1980s, the party supported social and economic liberalism and European integration. As the Hungarian political landscape crystallized following {{the fall of communism}} and the first free elections, Fidesz began moving to the right. Although Fidesz was in opposition to the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum's</b> national-conservative coalition government from 1990 to 1994, by 1998 Fidesz was the most prominent conservative political force in Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|Although the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum’s</b> (MDF) {{national}} {{leadership of the}} MDF had reservations, Filep (supported by local Fidesz and MDF groups) recruited participants and searched for a suitable location. She wanted to include guests at the [...] "common destiny camp", a gathering of intellectuals and opposition activists from Central and Eastern European countries in Martonvásár (not far from Lake Balaton) scheduled to end date on 20 August. The site chosen for the picnic was on Bratislava Road in Sopron, a border crossing since 1922.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately after József Antall's death, Boross became acting Prime Minister of Hungary on 12 December 1993. On the {{following}} day, the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Forum's</b> national {{board and the}} parliamentary group jointly convened, where three candidates, Péter Boross, Iván Szabó and Lajos Für ran for the position of prime minister. In the first round, Boross received 89 votes {{and came to the}} first place, defeating Szabó (79 votes) and Für (62 votes). In the second round, Boross gained a two-thirds support against Szabó and was nominated the party's designated premier. On 21 December 1993, the National Assembly elected Boross as Prime Minister by a vote of 201-152, with 5 abstentions. The parliamentary group leader Imre Kónya succeeded him as Minister of Interior but apart from that the personal composition of the government remained unchanged, as a result journalistic and academic works often refer to the MDF government between 1990 and 1994 as the [...] "Antall-Boross cabinet".|$|R
