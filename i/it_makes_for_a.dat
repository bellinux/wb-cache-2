25|$|In the United States, {{competitive}} drifters {{are required}} to run US DOT-approved (road legal) tires similar to racing slicks in rubber composition, but with shallow treads included. This is permitted, {{with the exception of}} some major championships including D1GP and Formula Drift which only permits commercially available tires that are approved by the sanctioning body. Professional drifting has come to the point where grip is tuned into cars to be defeated. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> faster drift necessary in the current professional climate. Tires typically used by drifters are around the DOT treadwear rating of 200. Examples include the Hankook Ventus RS-3, Falken Azenis RT615K, Nitto NT05, Yokohama ADVAN Neova AD08R, and Achilles Radial 123s.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E

She ultimately gave the episode a C+ grade. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk called the entry [...] "borderline weird" [...] and used it as evidence that [...] "the ninth season [...] arguably the worst season of the series." [...] The A.V.

[...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E

[...] Sputnikmusic staff writer Mike Stagno awarded the album a [...] "great" [...] 3½ out of five grading. He explained that, [...] "Invented reins in Jimmy Eat World after Chase This Light. It still possesses the same inviting, feel-good sentiment, but it's expressed more personably, and in this regard <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very rewarding listen." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang! awarded an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! score and opined, [...] "Invented is a return to the creative peaks of yore.

Some of the comments regarding the Lexus LFA's V10 were [...] "A mix of road and racing engines: Lexus LFA's utterly intoxicating 4.8 Liter V10.", [...] "There is the noise <b>it</b> <b>makes,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> start, a dense shriek like a V10 F1 car's", [...] "Then there's the wall of torque from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm and a strong thrust even before that", [...] "Lighter than an average V6 and it even meets the Euro 5 emission standards", [...] "It is hard to imagine that such an engine's career will be over when all the LFAs are built, given the love that has gone into it.

2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first series of Life on Mars was extremely positive. Steve O'Brien, writing for SFX, declared, [...] "It looks like BBC One has... a monster hit on its hands... It's funny... and dramatic and exciting, and we're really not getting paid for saying this". Alison Graham, television editor for the Radio Times, described the series as [...] "a genuinely innovative and imaginative take on an old genre". James Walton of The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Theoretically, this should {{add up to a}} right old mess. In practice, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> thumpingly enjoyable piece of television — not least because everybody involved was obviously having such a great time". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote: [...] "Life on Mars {{was more than just a}} jolly, tongue-in-cheek romp into the past... Once there, in 1973, we find ourselves immersed in a reasonably gripping police drama — yes, The Sweeney, perhaps, with better production values... Or put another — undeniably laboured — way, as poor Sam Tyler walks through his sunken dream, I'm hooked to the silver screen". Although Peter Paterson of the Daily Mail reflected the views of many other commentators on the first episode when he wondered, [...] "Can its intriguing conceit be sustained over eight one-hour episodes?", Critical reaction remained generally positive throughout the programme's run. Of the second series, Alison Graham believed that [...] "Sam Tyler and Gene Hunt are shaping up nicely as one of the great TV detective partnerships... It's vastly enjoyable and manages to stay just about believable thanks to some strong writing and, of course, the two marvellous central performances".|$|E

[...] Chavez compares the manga to the television series, 24, where [...] "every hour of every day must be utilized to its fullest". He also compares VS to Nodame Cantabile, saying, [...] "Nodame uses comedy to bring life to music than can be considered dry to younger readers. VS uses angst to do much of same." [...] Mania.com's Jarred Pine criticises the manga for the [...] "SFX [...] are translated with overlays, only sometimes the underlying Japanese text is not removed. I've seen this with quite a few CMX titles and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very ugly looking job." [...] Pine also criticises the characters, saying [...] "The biggest strike against VS is the complete lack of any interesting, likeable, or memorable characters. The lead, Reiji, is a complete smug and arrogant fool right from the beginning. While creator Keiko Yamada does try to humanize him a bit with a back story of familial abuse, it's quickly shooed aside and has little effect on the reader." [...] Manga Life's Dan Polley {{comments that}} [...] "Reiji’s character — like most shōjo manga — is the focus, and deservedly so. The character is hot-tempered, yet is able to retain a bit of aloofness, especially in [...] Those types of personality traits are generally excellently fleshed out in shōjos, and particularly in this volume." ...|$|E
