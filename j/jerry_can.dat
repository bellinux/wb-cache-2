25|$|The book {{left the}} {{impression}} that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth in my daughter's case. The list apparently has developed a life of its own and for Today to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother <b>Jerry</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop {{was part}} of a screen for {{infantry}} advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting forward. Machine gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to splatter in his face, and his tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A <b>jerry</b> <b>can</b> of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet holes in it. For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the area}} of the Omarska mining complex that was used for the camp, the camp {{authorities}} generally confined the prisoners in three different buildings: the administration building, where interrogations and killings took place; the crammed hangar building; the [...] "white house", where the inmates were tortured; and on a cement courtyard area between the buildings known as the [...] "pista", an L-shaped strip of concrete land in between, also a scene of torture and mass killings. There was another small building, known as the [...] "red house", where prisoners were sometimes taken in order to be summarily executed. With the arrival of the first detainees, permanent guard posts and anti-personnel landmines were set up around the camp. The conditions in the camp were horrible. In the building known as the [...] "white house", the rooms were crowded with 45 people in a room no larger than [...] The faces of the detainees were distorted and bloodstained and the walls were covered with blood. From the beginning, the detainees were beaten with fists, rifle butts and wooden and metal sticks. The guards mostly hit the heart and kidneys whenever they decided to beat someone to death. In the [...] "garage", between 150 and 160 people were [...] "packed like sardines" [...] and the heat was unbearable. For the first few days, the detainees were not allowed out and were given only a <b>jerry</b> <b>can</b> of water and some bread. Men would suffocate during the night and their bodies would be taken out the following morning. The room behind the restaurant was known as [...] "Mujo’s Room". The dimensions of this room were about [...] and the average number of people detained there was 500, most of whom were Bosniaks. The women in the camp slept in the interrogations rooms, which they would have to clean each day as the rooms were covered in blood and pieces of skin and hair. In the camp one could hear the moaning and wailing of people who were being beaten.|$|E

30|$|The {{situations}} {{are similar in}} Oran, Abidjan, Nouakchott, Dakar, N’djamena, Libreville and in Djibouti; households use more tins, casks of water recovery, <b>jerry</b> <b>cans</b> and big plastic buckets because of their resistance to corrosion (D’hont 1988).|$|R

60|$|Then Jerry, {{whose name}} is Geraldine only in the family Bible, talked to her about the weather. <b>Jerry</b> <b>can</b> talk {{interestingly}} about anything. In five minutes she had performed a miracle--she had made Miss Ponsonby laugh. In five minutes more she was leaning half {{out of the window}} showing Miss Ponsonby a new, white, fluffy, frivolous, chiffony waist of hers, and Miss Ponsonby was leaning halfway out of hers looking at it eagerly. At the end of {{a quarter of an hour}} they were exchanging confidences about their favourite books. Jerry was a confirmed Kiplingomaniac, but Miss Ponsonby adored Laura Jean Libbey. She said sorrowfully she supposed she ought not to read novels at all since her father disapproved. We found out later on that Mr. Ponsonby's way of expressing disapproval was to burn any he got hold of, and storm at his daughter about them like the confirmed old crank he was. Poor Miss Ponsonby had to keep her Laura Jeans locked up in her trunk, and it wasn't often she got a new one.|$|E

These shortages are not due to drought or water scarcity, but to poor execution and lack of completion of works, poor maintenance and numerous illegal connections to the network. Residents store water in tanks or <b>jerry</b> <b>cans</b> in their houses, or fill up <b>jerry</b> <b>cans</b> at water towers particularly during the summer.
