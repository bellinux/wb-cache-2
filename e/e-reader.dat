5|$|Pokémon Channel was {{developed}} by Nintendo subsidiary Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It was created both {{to serve as a}} spiritual successor to Hey You, Pikachu!—a similar digital pet-type game wherein the player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the Nintendo <b>e-Reader</b> peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the <b>e-Reader</b> device itself. When scanned, the cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.|$|E

This subject has previously not been discussed, either in Czech Republic or abroad. A base for this research consisted of 10 <b>e-readers</b> that {{can be regarded as}} important. Comparison of these <b>e-readers</b> revealed that functions of the first commercially available type are very {{similar to those of the}} models released in 2011. Moreover, the <b>e-readers</b> from the late 1990 s had more functions than some of the latest contemporary models have. This article offers possible reasons leading to this situation and suggests possibilities for further research...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} mixed reviews about the {{potential}} of <b>e-readers</b> to enhance higher education. At first glance, <b>e-readers</b> appear to have significant potential {{to provide students with}} access to course content and learning materials. There are a number of considerations and obstacles to be addressed, however, before these devices are ready for widespread adoption. This paper reports on a pilot study using <b>e-readers</b> to provide students without internet access, with access to electronic course content. Course readings were converted into ePub format and were made available to a cohort of 16 incarcerated students via <b>e-readers.</b> This paper provides an overview of the steps undertaken as well the challenges and obstacles encountered in converting the readings to ePub format. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} rather quickly as {{a sequel to}} the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo <b>e-Reader</b> accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is mostly}} unchanged {{from the previous}} games; the player controls the main character from an overhead perspective, and the controls are largely {{the same as those}} of previous games. As with previous games, the main objectives are to catch all of the Pokémon in the games and defeat the Elite Four (a group of Pokémon trainers); also like their predecessors, the games' main subplot involves the main character defeating a criminal organization that attempts to take over the region. New features, such as double battles and Pokémon abilities along with 135 new Pokémon, have been added. As the Game Boy Advance is more powerful than its predecessors, four players may be connected at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can be connected to an <b>e-Reader</b> or other advanced generation Pokémon games.|$|E

5|$|Miyamoto {{created a}} greatly {{simplified}} version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Amiga, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1983 {{as one of}} the system's three launch titles; the same version was an early title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, the cement factory level is not included, nor are most of the cutscenes since Nintendo did not have large enough cartridge ROMs available in the beginning. This port includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen; an arrangement of the tune appears in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the <b>e-Reader</b> and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The Famicom version of the game sold 840,000 units in Japan.|$|E
