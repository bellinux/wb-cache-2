Production started in 1980 {{with the use of}} components from both the BMP-1 and BMP-2. Fifty IRMs were produced from 1986. However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one emergency hatch in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and steering and two cases with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable aiming circle, one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR <b>echo</b> <b>depth</b> <b>finder</b> with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 portable mine detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their operating position in under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds. In the west, the IRM was believed to be based on the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer until 1986 when its true origins became known.|$|E

50|$|Other serial {{signaling}} standards may not interoperate with standard-compliant RS-232 ports. For example, {{using the}} TTL levels of near +5 and 0 V puts the mark {{level in the}} undefined area of the standard.

50|$|This {{technique}} has been superseded by sonic <b>depth</b> <b>finders</b> for measuring mechanically {{the depth of}} water beneath a ship, one version {{of which is the}} Fathometer (trademark). The record made by such a device is a fathogram. A fathom line or fathom curve, a usually sinuous line on a nautical chart, joins all points having the same depth of water, thereby indicating the contour of the ocean floor.|$|R
50|$|All those {{mentioned}} {{were the}} traditional instruments used {{until well into}} {{the second half of the}} 20th century. After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and <b>depth</b> <b>finders</b> have totally replaced their older counterparts. Radar has become widespread even in small boats. Some Electronic aids to navigation like LORAN have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by GPS.|$|R

30|$|De-skilling insinuates that a {{sport is}} made easier to {{undertake}} {{as a result}} of the introduction of a technology or product (Sheridan 2006). For example, the sport of aeromodelling has suggested that performance enhancements made to the planes design and controls would reduce the technical skill required to fly the planes and perform complex manoeuvres (Norris 2011). Likewise, innovations such as <b>depth</b> <b>finders,</b> bait casting reels and sonar, has increased anglings popularity but deskilled the requirement of fish detection and landing. This ultimately required the introduction of ‘technologically-designed handicaps’ by the sport’s governing body to ensure fair play (Hummel and Foster 1986).|$|R
5000|$|In 1922 a {{historic}} moment in cartography and oceanography occurred. The USS Stewart used a Navy Sonic <b>Depth</b> <b>Finder</b> {{to draw a}} continuous map across {{the bed of the}} Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel. [...] The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, abyssal plains, trenches, seamounts, basins, plateaus, canyons, and some guyots. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.|$|R
25|$|To avoid {{electrical}} interference with her sensitive hydrographic surveying equipment, Explorer′s deck machinery and major auxiliary equipment all {{was driven by}} high-pressure steam. When commissioned, Explorer was considered to have the finest and most extensive hydrographic surveying equipment {{in the history of}} the Coast and Geodetic Survey′s fleet, all entirely electrically powered. The equipment included a fathometer, a Dorsey sonic <b>depth</b> <b>finder,</b> a Hughes automatic depth recorder system, a special taut-wire measuring gear with 120 nautical miles (138 statute miles; 222km) of fine wire and several tons of iron balls, and hydrophones. Electrolysis eliminators mounted to her hull ensured that she would be grounded so as to avoid interference with her electrical surveying equipment.|$|R

In July 1923 she joined [...] to serve as escort for President Warren G. Harding embarked in [...] for a cruise to Alaskan and Canadian waters (during which President Harding came down with his last illness). She rejoined her division to participate in the American Legion convention at San Francisco in October 1923. On 8-9 September 1924, she embarked Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur for a visit to Mare Island Navy Yard. From 28 August to 9 September 1925 she served as station ship during nonstop airplane flight from Hawaii to San Francisco.|$|R

A <b>depth</b> <b>finder</b> and map are provided telling the depths of the various portions of that area, which can be accessed from the menu, that also has an option of allowing the weather to be changed. Outside of the water can be seen various man made items such as buildings, docks, bridges, while in the water are weeds, lily pads, logs, brush, and tree stumps.

40|$|An {{echo sounder}} is {{adjusted}} for constant sound velocity, usually 1500 m/sec. Since {{the velocity of}} sound in the sea is varying with temperature, salinity and depth, a correction is necessary if accurate soundings are required. The present paper shows a practical method for the computation of this correction. 49 of the "G. Sars" stations, taken in the years 1951 - 55, are fairly well covering the Norwegian Sea (Fig. 3). These stations {{have been used as}} basic material for the computation of the depth correction presented in Figs. 4 - 10. The correction is given as percentage of measured <b>echo</b> <b>depth</b> for the following depths (meters) : 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of modest equipment and software revealed bottom contours and water column conditions of a dynamic water body. Classroom discussions of field techniques and equipment capabilities followed by exercises {{with the data}} sets in cause-and-effect analysis all contributed to participatory education {{in the process of}} science. This project is presented as a case study of the value of engaging secondary and collegiate level students in planning, executing and appraising a real world investigation which they can directly relate to. A 1 km wide bay, experiencing marsh inflow, along an 8 km long lake situated 120 km north of Ottawa, Canada, on the glaciated Canadian Precambrian Shield was mapped in midsummer for submerged topography, bottom composition, temperature profile, turbudity, dissolved oxygen and biota distribution. Low level aerial photographs scanned into image processing software are permitting spatial classification of bottom variations in biology and geology. Instrumentation consisted of a portable sport fishing SONAR <b>depth</b> <b>finder,</b> an electronic lead line multiprobe with photocell, thermistor and dissolved oxygen sensors, a selective depth water sampler, portable pH meter, an underwater camera mounted on a home-made platform with a bottom-contact trigger and a disposable underwater camera for shallow survey work.

50|$|A {{pulse of}} {{ultrasound}} from the transducer might travel nanoseconds or microseconds {{to reach an}} internal interface and be reflected back to the transducer. If there are several internal interfaces at different <b>depths,</b> the <b>echoes</b> will arrive at the transducer at different times. Planar acoustic images do not often use all return <b>echoes</b> from all <b>depths</b> to make the visible acoustic image. Instead, a time window is created that accepts only those return <b>echoes</b> from the <b>depth</b> of interest. This process is known as “gating” the return echoes.|$|R
40|$|Phased array techniques, {{providing}} an electronic {{control of the}} beam, are widely used in ultrasonic imaging. Such techniques, making use of array transducers with delayed transmission pulse on each element, allow to steer and focus the beam, enabling various testing configurations and imaging procedures : sector scanning and tomography, tracking <b>echoes,</b> <b>depth</b> focusing. In nuclear industry, various configurations of geometry and materials are encountered, which require many different testing configurations. The CEA (French Atomic Energy Commission) has developed an adaptive system based on phased array techniques dynamically controlled by a multi-channel acquisition system: theF. A. U. S. T. (Focusing Adaptive UltraSonic Tomography) system. This system aims at improving the performances of nondestructive testing, particularly for what concerns the adaptability to different control configurations and defect characterization. Previous works have described this system, its performances for beam forming and also its specific abilities for defect characterization using beam steering or spatial amplitude distribution at reception [1, 2]...|$|R
40|$|Correlation {{interpolation}} {{is introduced}} {{as a method}} to determine the displace-ment of moving biological tissue {{on the basis of}} a sequence of ultrasonic echo sig-nals. The echo signal is sampled along the <b>echo</b> <b>depth</b> with approximately 4 samples per average high frequency period. Sampling in time occurs with the pulse repetition frequency. The necessary information is extracted from a crosscorrelation function between successive signals, which is modelled using four parameters. The parameters are estimated from five calculated correlation sums and the shift with maximum correlation is determined. In contrast to existing techniques, the performance of this method is determined mainly by the number of samples used, while the ratio of the number of samples in depth and time is irrelevant. Using 64 samples at a signal-to-noise power ratio of 10, the standard deviation of the error in the determination of the shift in depth is 0. 08 sampling intervals. As in many other methods, the width of the aliasing interval equals the mean frequency period...|$|R

50|$|Hull {{technology}} is the innovation and R&D that the manufacturers put into their boats to ensure the best stock wake possible. Many boarders use aftermarket ballast and lead to further weigh down their boats for very large wakes or for sports such as wake surfing. Most wakeboat manufacturers have installed factory ballast but sometimes more weight is needed. Ballast can {{take the form of}} hard tanks or soft bags which are filled with water from the body of water the boat is being operated on. Wakeboard boats have a certain type of hull to allow for bigger wakes. The bigger the wake the more the stern is sitting in the water. These boats are not good for shallow waters considering their draft is roughly over 3 feet. There is a rudder propeller and shaft drive along with three fins directly under the boat. Shallow waters with that much instruments under the boat will call for disaster. These boats are not good substitutes for fishing boats for that reason. Most fishing boats have a flat bottom hull and an outboard motor which is completely retractable. They also have a plastic trolling motor in case they ever get into sticky situations. Wakeboard boats offer <b>depth</b> <b>finders</b> to keep out of the shallow stuff. People often think that if they ruin a prop on an inboard that it will be an easy fix. Inboard props do not come off without a special tool that can be costly.|$|R

40|$|Characterization is a {{critical}} step in the remediation of contaminated materials and facilities. Severe physical- and radiological-access restrictions made the task of characterizing the World War II-era underground radioactive storage tanks at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) particularly challenging. The innovative and inexpensive tank characterization system (TCS) developed to meet this challenge at ORNL is worthy of consideration for use in similar remediation projects. The TCS is a floating system that uses the existing water in the tank as a platform that supports instruments and samplers mounted on a floating boom. TCS operators feed the unit into an existing port of the tank to be characterized. Once inserted, the system`s position is controlled by rotation and by insertion and withdrawal of the boom. The major components of the TCS system include the following: (1) boom support system that consists of a boom support structure and a floating boom, (2) video camera and lights, (3) sludge grab sampler, (4) wall chip sampler, and (5) sonar <b>depth</b> <b>finder.</b> This simple design allows access to all parts of a tank. Moreover, the use of off-the-shelf components keeps the system inexpensive and minimizes maintenance costs. The TCS proved invaluable in negotiating the hazards of ORNL`s Gunite and Associated Tanks, which typically contain a layer of radioactive sludge, have only one to three access ports that are usually only 12 - or 24 -in. in diameter, and range from 12 to 50 ft in diameter. This paper reviews both the successes and the difficulties encountered in using the TCS for treatability studies at ORNL and discusses the prospects for its wider application in remediation activities...|$|R

40|$|Doppler radar {{measurements}} in {{a number}} of Hawaiian rain echoes indicated a vari-able amount of convection, with vertical air velocities ranging from unmeasurably small values in some cases to values of 7 m/sec in the more convective cases. The echoes exhibiting weak vertical motions usually had a stratiform appearance when plotted on coordinates of height versus time: contours of signal intensity and Doppler velocity tended to be approximately horizontal. The intensity decreased with altitude in these cases, and vertical gradients as strong as 20 db/km were not uncommon. In the echoes exhibiting strong vertical air motions, signal intensities, <b>echo</b> <b>depth,</b> and surface rainfall rate tended to be higher. Radar reflectivity factors as high as lo 6 mm 6 /m 3 were observed. Although height-time patterns revealed less order than in the echoes with weak updraft velocities, there was a tendency for the leading (upslope) portion of a convective echo to be more active than the trailing portion. As echoes progressed further upslope they tended to become more stratiform in character. The fact that moderate rain could at times fall from shallow, stratiform clouds, taken in conjunction with the strong vertical reflectivity gradients observed in these cases, indicates a high efficiency of the precipitation process in Hawaiian orographic clouds. The observations in convective echoes clearly demonstrate that convective motions erihance the process...|$|R

Blinded as a young child, Johnson was singing this song as a warning to those who had learned to read, but concerned themselves too much with earthly matters, but Johnson tries to point the way to salvation. He admits to having fault, and he blames himself for not taking advantage of the skill he has, reading, and saving himself. The context of this song is strictly religious.

The values of <b>echo</b> sounder <b>depth</b> can be plotted against the [...] "true" [...] depth of the bar.

40|$|Basin {{morphology}} and depositional stratigraphy of Lake Donggi Cona on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau {{has been}} studied with <b>echo</b> <b>depth</b> sounding and shallow seismic sub-bottom profiling. The basin is a pull-apart structure situated at the highly active Kunlun fault. It is characterised by a 92 m deep graben structure {{in the western part}} of the lake basin, and a shallow eastern lake part, the latter filled up with fluvial sediments from a large alluvial plain. Three prominent morphological levels were identified at 24 m, 39 m and 57 m below present lake level. They were partly created by basin subsidence, while the deposition of prograding delta sediments primarily formed the morphological steps. The inherited tectonic structures control on-going neotectonic activity, which seems to have only minor influence on present basin morphology. The basin is filled by sediments of at least 30 m thickness in the depocentre. Three major depositional units can be distinguished. In comparison with lithological changes in a sediment core, they give evidence of pronounced lake-level fluctuations and dramatic changes in lake volume. A numerical age datum of w 19 cal ka BP at the base of the sediment core allows a tentative reconstruction of Late Glacial to Holocene lake development. A very low base level preceded a time of delta formation during higher lake level, i. e. w 26 m lower than present during Last Glacial Maximum, creating a lake of only 18 % of its present size. At the transition to Holocene the lake-level rose very quickly changing to a deep lake environment. Thus, transgression may have promoted maximum lake stands...|$|R
