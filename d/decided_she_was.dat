5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, {{he decided that}} she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E
25|$|In March 1981, 22-year-old Keryn Barnes, an {{aspiring}} actress from Georgia {{who had been}} the Carsons' roommate in San Francisco, was found dead in their shared apartment. She had been stabbed thirteen times and her skull crushed before being wrapped in a blanket and hidden in the basement. Evidence suggested that Keryn had been killed by someone she knew, and the Carsons became the prime suspects. However, the family disappeared before the body was found. The Carsons later confessed to killing Keryn after Suzan had <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a witch.|$|E

25|$|HMS Nimrod was a brig-sloop of the British Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1812. She spent her war years in north American waters where she captured one small privateer, {{assisted in the}} capture of another, and captured or destroyed some 50 American vessels. After the war she captured smuggles and assisted the civil authorities in maintaining order in Tyne. She was wrecked in 1827 and so damaged that the Navy <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not worth repairing. A private ship-owner purchased Nimrod and repaired her. She {{then went on to}} spend some 20 years trading between Britain and Charleston, the Mediterranean, Australia, and India. She was last listed in 1851.|$|E
25|$|When he was 18 Duleep Singh {{wrote to}} his mother in Kathmandu, {{suggesting}} that she should join him in England, but his letter was intercepted by the British in India and did not reach her. He then sent a courier, Pundit Nehemiah Goreh, who was also intercepted and forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself. Under cover of a letter from Login he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, who reported that the Rani had 'much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.' The British <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no longer a threat and she was allowed to join her son on 16 January 1861 at Spence’s Hotel in Calcutta and return with him to England.|$|E

500|$|Baird {{met with}} Biden twice, both times leaving {{his office in}} tears, {{although}} Biden publicly stated {{that he did not}} think the matter would prevent her nomination. [...] Baird actually had more immediate support from ranking member Orrin Hatch, who called it [...] "no big deal." [...] This reflected a considerable degree of Republican support for Baird, as they <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more in tune with their stance on some issues than a replacement would likely be.|$|E
500|$|Howard Gordon, the {{executive}} producer of 24, said that, during character development, they [...] "wanted an actress that had the strength and intelligence to be a first lady, yet have the unpredictability of never knowing when she might snap." [...] Jean Smart was their first choice. [...] Smart later told The New York Times that she <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> eager to play the role after reading the character's introductory scene, and commented that in her almost 30years of acting she had come across few roles that offered the possibilities that this one did: a character that is sexy, mysterious, and powerful, yet is mentally unstable and has lost her trust and respect for her husband.|$|E
500|$|Carmella's exit storyline was devised {{months prior}} to Blair's departure. Producers had planned to reunite Carmella and Oliver and have them leave together, however Hoflin decided to go travelling, meaning he was {{unavailable}} for filming. Prior to Hoflin's departure, he and Balir filmed scenes showing their reunion. Scripts were quickly rewritten to portray Oliver in Portugal, where Hoflin was in real life, instead of New York where Oliver left for upon his exit. Describing her reaction to Carmella's scripts towards the end, Blair commented: [...] "After a while I'd open my script and say, 'Please give me one scene where I'm smiling'. And then I'd read the script and think, 'Damn - no smiling scenes again'." [...] Blair had originally hoped that Carmella would be killed on-screen, as she felt a dramatic send off would have been fitting. After the [...] "tragic" [...] final year Carmella underwent, Blair <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> happy with the exit because [...] "something finally goes right for her". Blair also opined: [...] "It's a really lovely story and I think the fans will be happy with it." [...] Carmella's [...] "happy exit storyline" [...] saw her leaving in a taxi surrounded by all of her friends waving her off, after they convinced her {{to start a new}} life with Oliver.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{original}} draft, {{the second act}} would have portrayed Lisa travelling on the short school bus and meeting children with amusing disabilities, but it was deemed [...] "too radical" [...] at the time.

Lister and Stein had worked together {{before and the}} Jacksons approved her. A few days afterwards Field told her that Jackie wanted his girlfriend, who he said was a dancer herself, {{to be in the}} video. She auditioned and Lister <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sufficiently talented to hire, putting her in a group of similarly-built women so her short stature and plumpness would be less noticeable.|$|E

2500|$|After {{more than}} 60 actresses had been auditioned, {{the first choice}} {{to play the role}} was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, [...] "The Town of No Return", and part of [...] "The Murder Market"), Shepherd was released. Her {{on-screen}} personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman's Gale and it was <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg (she had earlier guested in an episode of The Sentimental Agent that Clemens had written). Her screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.|$|E

After an audition, Abdel Wahab <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the one he was looking for. After her role in the film, people called her [...] "Egypt's own Shirley Temple". The director liked her acting and was impressed with her so much that he signed a contract with her father. Four years later, she was chosen by Kareem for another role with Abdel Wahab in the film Rossassa Fel Qalb (رصاصة في القلب, Bullet in the Heart, 1944) and in another film two years later, Dunya (دنيا, Universe, 1946).

2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her?
