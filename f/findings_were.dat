5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} out why the committee's <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> never made public.|$|E
5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E

The Spitzer Space Telescope was also used. Kepler-11's planetary system became the first discovered extrasolar system with more than three transiting planets, as well as the most compact and flattest system yet discovered, according to NASA. The planets of Kepler-11, including Kepler-11e, were announced jointly at a press conference on February 2, 2011. The <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> published in the journal Nature on February 3.|$|E

On March 31, 1952 (exactly 21 years after the death of Knute Rockne), McMillin died of a heart attack; his funeral was attended by many fellow coaches and former players.|$|E
5|$|In 1610, Galileo Galilei {{discovered}} the four largest moons of Jupiter (now {{known as the}} Galilean moons) using a telescope; {{thought to be the}} first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. One day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614. It was Marius's names for the four major moons, however, that stuck—Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> also the first discovery of celestial motion not apparently centered on Earth. The discovery was a major point in favor of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the Inquisition.|$|E

[...] However: [...] "Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds," [...] which means that *new* discoveries will come from research that, when that research started, had low or very low odds (a low or very low chance) of succeeding. Hence, if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge, research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield most new discoveries.|$|R

5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found.

5|$|In central Europe, {{this species}} has been {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} Austrian Danube, where it was first recorded in Tulln, Lower Austria in 2001. In the Czech Republic, it is now extinct in Bohemia; the only <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> in the Elbe river near Litoměřice in 1917, {{and the most recent}} findings of empty shells took place in 1943. Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland, in Slovakia where it is non-indigenous since 2002, and in Hungary. Zettler (2008) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution of T. fluviatilis in Germany. The indigenous distribution of T. fluviatilis included all of the large rivers: Rhine, Main, Moselle, Neckar, Weser, Elbe and Oder. However, this species is now highly endangered in Germany (Stark gefährdet).|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
