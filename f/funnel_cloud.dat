5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} funnel clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} funnel clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible funnel is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> and a tornado from a distance.|$|E
500|$|The {{winds of}} the tornado vortex and of {{constituent}} turbulent eddies, {{as well as}} airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. <b>Funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> also produce sounds. <b>Funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or the buzzing of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of [...] "noise".|$|R
40|$|During the 12 years 1949 through 1960, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were {{observed}} over {{or near the}} Hawaiian Islands on 31 days. About half of these occurrences mere waterspouts, {{but most of the}} other funnels remained aloft. Although none of the <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> which reached or occurred over land during this period, or previously, appears to have attained the intensity or destructiveness of the major tornadoes of the continental United States, a number of them did minor damage. The climatology and synoptic concomitants of <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> in Hawaii are compared with those of similar events elsewhere, and the associated air mass properties illustrated by several proximity soundings. Among the questions considered is whether the Hawaiian Islands serve merely as a vantage point from which to observe <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> occurring over the nearby open seas, or whether through topography or otherwise they contribute to their formation. A close study of the pertinent circumstances suggests that mhile certain of the funnels may with some confidence be ascribed primarily to local or to synoptic efYects, most of them appear to have involved the interaction of both 1...|$|R
50|$|Shortly thereafter, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were {{reported}} {{within the same}} supercell in Fauquier County, Virginia and Prince William County, Virginia.|$|R
5|$|In Virginia, a large band of {{thunderstorms}} {{associated with}} the hurricane brought strong winds and spawned three tornadoes. A <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> formed in Albemarle County evolved into an F3 tornado after crossing into Greene County. It destroyed two houses and uprooted several trees, inflicting $250,000 in damage (1985USD, $470,000 2006USD). F0 tornadoes were also generated in Goochland County and Hanover County; the two tornadoes damaged a total of ten houses. Funnel clouds were sighted throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> drops from the sky, taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
50|$|Numerous <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> {{were also}} spotted in Alberta with a {{separate}} family of thunderstorms over the Canadian Prairies which also brought tornadoes in the Dakotas the following two days.|$|R
500|$|<b>Funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were {{reported}} along the Northern Neck. The hurricane produced a strong storm surge across northern Virginia, reaching [...] in Alexandria. Rainfall was light across the region, with amounts varying between 1–3inches (25–75mm).|$|R
50|$|Cold-air <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> (vortices) {{are usually}} {{short-lived}} and generally much weaker than the vortices produced by supercells. Although cold-air funnels rarely make ground contact, they may touch down briefly and become weak tornadoes or waterspouts.|$|R
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions to raising the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
25|$|A tuba {{feature is}} a cloud column that may {{hang from the}} bottom of a cumulus or cumulonimbus. A newly formed or poorly {{organized}} column might be comparatively benign, but can quickly intensify into a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> or tornado.|$|E
50|$|<b>Funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were {{reported}} along the Northern Neck. The hurricane produced a strong storm surge across northern Virginia, reaching 9.5 ft in Alexandria. Rainfall was light across the region, with amounts varying between 1-3 inches (25-75 mm).|$|R
50|$|After {{crossing}} lower Michigan, the derecho {{moved into}} the Windsor area of Ontario around 9:30pm EDT. Many electrical lines were blown down {{and a number of}} roofs were damaged. A tornado touched down near Stratford and numerous <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were reported.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to tornadoes, severe thunderstorms produced strong wind gusts that damaged {{at least three}} homes near Lehigh Acres. Multiple <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> occurred over at least two counties in southern Florida, {{and at least one}} waterspout touched down near West Palm Beach.|$|R
25|$|In Pittsburgh, a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> {{was spotted}} {{downtown}} near the Carnegie Science Center, shattering windows and evacuating the 1000 patrons {{to the lower}} level. The museum was closed until August 13. Over 90,000 homes and businesses were without power, some not receiving it until August 12.|$|E
25|$|Preparedness {{involves}} knowing the major dangers to avoid. Some tornadoes {{are the most}} violent storms in nature. Tornadoes have varied in strength, and some tornadoes have been mostly invisible {{due to a lack}} of loose dirt or debris in the <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud.</b> Spawned from severe thunderstorms, tornadoes have caused fatalities and devastated neighborhoods within seconds of arrival.|$|E
25|$|Significant waterspouts, <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> sightings, dense fog, dense smoke, dust storms, dust devils, debris flows (such as landslides), avalanches, tsunami {{and other}} surf and tide events, {{volcanic}} ash, {{as well as}} other extreme or unusual weather may also be listed. Annual summaries of selected event types are listed in the December issue for older years and in a separate issue for recent years.|$|E
40|$|While {{the northeastern}} portion of Colorado is more infamously {{known for the}} {{occurrence}} of frequent hail, the incidence of tornadoes is not as widespread. The U. S. Weather Bureau [3] statistics indicate an annual average of only 2. 23 tornadoes; however, during the 6 -year period 1960 - 65, this average has increased to 12. 5 observed tornadoes per year. This figure does not include, of course, observations of <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds.</b> This higher average probably reflects the increased number of "weather conscious " observers. Data gathered by the Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, reveal a total of seven confirmed tornadoes and nine <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> reported {{in the area of}} Colorado north and east of Denver to the State lines during the period June 1 to July 30, 1965...|$|R
50|$|The second tornado, also an F2, was {{associated}} {{by the same}} supercell that had ravaged Fayette County, Pennsylvania; Preston County, West Virginia; and Garrett County, Maryland. While the tornado lifted over eastern Garrett County, numerous <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> were sighted over Bloomington in Garrett County, {{and one of the}} <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> touched down {{on the east side of}} Green Mountain (along the Alleghany Front) in Mineral County, 5 miles southwest of Keyser, at 10:33 pm EDT. A car was blown over and many trees were uprooted, some thrown onto houses. The twister crossed New Creek Mountain before destroying a mobile home, crossing US Route 220, and causing major damage to forested areas and more structural damage. Another mobile home was rolled near Ridgeville near U.S. Route 50, and a barn was destroyed near Mill Creek Country Club, just west of Burlington.|$|R
50|$|The SKYWARN program, which trains {{citizens}} {{on how to}} spot tornadoes, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds,</b> wall clouds, {{and other}} severe weather phenomena, is offered by the National Weather Service. Used in tandem with Doppler radar information, eyewitness reports can be very helpful for warning the public of an impending tornado, especially when used for ground truthing.|$|R
25|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds are the visual {{manifestation of a}} mesocyclone. Barring a {{low-level}} boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a corner of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters monitor all areas of a storm and their surroundings.|$|E
500|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a storm surge and heavy rainfall wrought by Debra led to widespread flooding on highways, including that on Highway75 northwest of Galveston on July25 which caused the detachment of Galveston Island from the mainland for several hours. Other major roadways flooded were Highway6 between Hitchcock and Galveston; Highway146 from Kemah to Seabrook; and Farm Road518 extending from Kemah through League City. An unconfirmed report indicated that a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> briefly touched down roughly [...] northwest of Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport at approximately 0027UTC, though no damage occurred.|$|E
500|$|A {{thunderstorm}} is classed {{as severe}} if winds reach at least , hail is [...] in diameter or larger, or if funnel clouds or tornadoes are reported. Although a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> or tornado indicates a severe thunderstorm, a tornado warning is issued {{in place of}} a severe thunderstorm warning. A severe thunderstorm warning is issued if a thunderstorm becomes severe, or will soon turn severe. In Canada, a rainfall rate greater than [...] in one hour, or [...] in three hours, is also used to indicate severe thunderstorms. [...] Severe thunderstorms can occur from any type of storm cell. However, multicell, supercell, and squall lines represent the most common forms of thunderstorms that produce severe weather.|$|E
5000|$|Gusty winds {{produce a}} dust storm in Kansas, while Missouri is hit with hail and heavy rain, {{and a series}} of <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> move across Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana. The number of tornadoes range from six to twelve, but at least six strike the Midwest, killing {{approximately}} 221 people and injuring 761.|$|R
5000|$|Tornado Watch - Issued when {{conditions}} are favourable {{for the development}} of severe thunderstorms with one or more tornadoes. Tornado Watches are also issued when the possibility of cold core <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds</b> is likely, and poses a threat to people on the ground. If there is a landspout on the ground, a Tornado Warning will be issued.|$|R
500|$|Cumulonimbus {{clouds are}} the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when cumulus {{congestus}} clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops {{higher and higher}} into the atmosphere until they reach the tropopause at [...] in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds,</b> and tornadoes. They commonly have anvil clouds.|$|R
500|$|July 26, 2008 [...] The {{well-defined}} {{circulation of}} former Hurricane Dolly crossed Texas and eastern Mexico into southeastern New Mexico. Rainfall totals included a statewide peak of [...] in Sunspot, {{and more than}} 6in (150mm) Ruidoso. The high totals caused the Rio Ruidoso and Rio Bonito to overflow near Rudioso, which resulted in flooding {{in and around the}} city. One person died after being swept away by the Rio Ruidoso. Flooding near Mescalero caused two dams to fail at Mud Canyon. The system also spawned a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> near Las Cruces. Across the region, the flooding caused about $25million in damage after damaging about 500structures, including 47destroyed houses. The floods also washed out at least 13bridges.|$|E
500|$|Rough seas {{from the}} storm {{resulted}} in minor coastal flooding and beach erosion in North Carolina. Small craft advisories were issued along the Virginia and North Carolina coastlines as waves up to [...] affected the region. Several beaches were closed due to the rough conditions. By July2, the small craft advisories were discontinued as Amy tracked away from land. Tides up to [...] in Virginia resulted in some beach erosion and coastal flooding due to the prolonged duration of the event. Although no warnings were issued, boaters in Newfoundland were advised to closely monitor the storm. In Hampton, Virginia, a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> spawned by a squall line associated with Amy formed just offshore.|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Arthur was the {{earliest}} recorded landfalling North Carolina hurricane, coming onshore at 03:15UTC on July4. At Cape Lookout, a peak wind gust of [...] and 1-minute maximum sustained winds of [...] were recorded. A United States Coast Guard station in Cape Hatteras observed a peak gust of [...] An EF1 tornado touched down in Duplin County, damaging two structures and many trees, while a <b>funnel</b> <b>cloud</b> was sighted within {{the vicinity of}} Elm City. Another EF1 tornado was reported in Martin County, which knocked a tree onto a house. The highest rainfall total measured {{as a result of}} Arthur in North Carolina, , was recorded at Kinston. High tides were reported along the coast, with a peak storm surge of [...] at Oregon Inlet.|$|E
50|$|A {{slight risk}} of Severe Weather was issued across two areas on May 1, {{with the first}} {{encompassing}} portions of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and the second covering portions of Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia. Across Minnesota, a brief tornado touchdown was recorded, while numerous tornado touchdowns, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds,</b> and wall clouds were reported across Indiana and Illinois.|$|R
50|$|Cumulonimbus {{clouds are}} the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when cumulus {{congestus}} clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops {{higher and higher}} into the atmosphere until they reach the tropopause at 18000 m in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, <b>funnel</b> <b>clouds,</b> and tornadoes.
