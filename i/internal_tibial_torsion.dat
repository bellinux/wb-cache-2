40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{review the}} {{aetiology}} {{and management of}} intoeing. DATA SOURCES. Medline and non-Medline literature search, and personal experience. STUDY SELECTION. Studies that provided evidence-based information about the aetiology and management of paediatric intoeing gait were selected. DATA EXTRACTION. Data were extracted and reviewed independently by both authors. DATA SYNTHESIS. An intoeing gait affects many children and, as with flexible flatfoot, bowleg, and knock-knee, it {{falls into the category}} of physiological problems that occur in normal children. The usual causes are excessive femoral anteversion, <b>internal</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion,</b> and metatarsus adductus. Management is based on understanding the causes and the natural course of the condition and the effectiveness of various treatment modalities. Unfortunately, due to poor understanding of the condition, intoeing is commonly overtreated with braces or special footwear. CONCLUSIONS. Intoeing {{is one of the most}} common conditions encountered in paediatric orthopaedic practice. It is important to make an early diagnosis of pathological causes of intoeing such as cerebral palsy and developmental dysplasia of the hips so that treatment can be commenced as soon as possible. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

30|$|Femoral {{anteversion}} and/or outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> have {{a dramatic}} effect upon the kinematics of the knee, most notably {{of which may be}} seen at the patellofemoral join [11]. Eckhoff stated that “the patella is a passive component of the extensor mechanism, where the static and dynamic relationships of the underlying tibia and femur determine the patellar tracking pattern” [2]. Turner and Smillie in their measurements of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in over 800 patients found that patients with patellofemoral instability had a significant increase in outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> [16]. Increased femoral anteversion, external <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion,</b> pan genu torsion, and knee version (external rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur) have all been shown to be associated with anterior knee pain in various studies. Therefore, while patellar instability and/or persistent patellofemoral pain may require prompt and sometimes aggressive management, the possibility that there is a proximate cause of the problem should be kept in mind [1, 2, 8, 16].

Measurements on transverse CT images by two independent readers served as the reference standard. Intermethod and interreader agreement was calculated using descriptive statistics, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS Femoral and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> were - 6 °- 65 ° and 6 °- 51 ° for 3 D models based on biplanar radiography and - 13 °- 59 ° and 4 °- 52 ° for CT measurements. The average difference (±SD) between the two methods was 4. 9 °± 3. 8 ° and 5. 5 °± 4. 1 °, respectively. The intermethod ICC for biplanar radiography was 0. 90 (95 % CI, 0. 87 - 0. 92) for femoral torsion and 0. 75 (0. 68 - 0. 80) for <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion.</b> The interreader ICC was 0. 93 - 0. 97.

30|$|Infantile tibia vara is a {{deformity}} of abrupt angulation into varus {{due to an}} affection of the postromedial {{aspect of}} the proximal tibial physis. The deformity often includes <b>internal</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> and limb length discrepancy. Gradual correction of the deformity is currently the treatment of choice for these challenging cases as it requires less invasive surgery, allows progressive and adjustable correction, permits bone lengthening if needed and achieves a more accurate correction compared to acute correction. Elevation of the depressed medial tibial condyle allows restoration of the joint architecture. Different techniques described to elevate the depressed medial tibial plateau are all technically demanding and carry potential risks of unsalvageable intra-operative complications. The {{aim of this study}} is to report the results of a safer technique for the double elevation osteotomy combined with gradual correction using the Ilizarov frame, allowing it to be more reproducible, less technically demanding and avoid those potential complications. This study included 12 limbs in 8 patients (mean age 9  years), all were classified as stage V or VI according to the Langenskiold classification. All osteotomies healed completely in all patients. The mean time in the frame was 23  weeks. The mean preoperative femoral shaft-tibial shaft angle was 36 ° of varus. This improved to 5 ° of varus. The mean preoperative femoral condyle-tibial shaft angle was 58 °. This improved to 84 °. The mean preoperative angle of depressed medial tibial plateau was 63 °. This improved to 8 °. All patients were maintaining full extension of the knee at the final follow-up, and all patients noticed a significant improvement in their gait pattern. We believe that this technique is safer and less invasive compared to traditional and even newly described techniques for elevating the depressed medial tibial plateau and correcting the deformity in severe infantile tibia vara, which will allow it to be more reproducible.|$|E

The EOS System is a new biplanar low-dose radiographic device that allows 3 -dimensional lower-limb modelling with automated measurements of femoral and <b>tibial</b> rotational alignment (<b>torsion).</b> HypothesisFemoral and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> measurements provided by the EOS System are equivalent to those obtained using CT. Materials and methodsIn a retrospective analysis of 43 lower limbs in 30 patients, three senior radiologists measured femoral and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> on both CT and EOS images. Agreement between CT and EOS values was assessed by computing Pearson's correlation coefficient and interobserver reproducibility by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). ResultsFemoral torsion was 13. 4 ° by EOS vs. 13. 7 ° by CT (P= 0. 5) and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> was 30. 8 ° by EOS vs. 30. 3 ° by CT (P= 0. 4). Strong associations were found between EOS and CT values for both femoral torsion (P= 0. 93) and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> (P= 0. 89). With EOS, the ICC was 0. 93 for femoral torsion and 0. 86 for tibial torsion; corresponding values with CT were 0. 90 and 0. 92.

40|$|BACKGROUND Rotational {{deformities}} of {{the lower}} limbs are very common. There is increasing evidence that abnormal torsion in the tibia is associated with severe knee and ankle arthritis. Primary knee osteoarthritis is {{a leading cause of}} disability in older persons. Varus or valgus alignment increases the risk of osteoarthritis. Coexistence of tibial torsional deformity may increase the risk further. Variability in the <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> has been reported and is due to the torsional forces applied on tibia during development. The aim of the study is to estimate the angle of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> on both sides and both sexes. The present study was an attempt to provide baseline data of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in the East and South Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted mechanically on 100 dry adult unpaired human tibia, i. e. 50 male and 50 female bones. The measurements were recorded and statistically analysed using Student’s unpaired t-test using GraphPad Prism 5. 0 (free trial version). RESULTS Out of the 100 tibia undertaken, mean value of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> angle obtained is 25. 8 °. In males, it is 23. 68 ° and in females it is about 27. 86 °. Statistical analysis revealed significant greater average angle of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in female bones. The angle of the right-sided bones was more and this was statistically significant. CONCLUSION The gender variation for the angle could be the result of the difference in lifestyle in day-to-day activities.

Conclusion: There is no significant correlation between foot pronation and pelvic inclination, femoral anteversion, Q-angle and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion.</b> However, the correlation between these factors cannot be completely ignored, and thus, further studies and literature are required to prove the same...|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} examination included measurement of limb lengths, frontal knee alignment (varus/valgus), {{observation of the}} gait pattern and prone torsional profile, noting the degrees of inward and outward hip rotation and the thigh/foot axis. We did not recommend surgery unless the degree of excessive femoral torsion (beyond the normal 11 °) measured greater than 20 °. The gait pattern was observed with attention to both the foot progression angle and the knee progression angle. The foot progression angle may appear normal in patients with concomitant outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion.</b> However, the effects of inward femoral and outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> are cumulative, not compensatory, {{with respect to the}} patella and knee. For example, a patient with 30 ° of femoral anteversion and 30 ° outward thigh–foot axis (<b>tibial</b> <b>torsion)</b> is subject to 60 ° of torsional stress on the knee. For these patients, simultaneous femoral and tibial osteotomies are justified. We elected not to employ PROMs (patient-reported outcomes) because we did not have an adequate tool to apply for this retrospective series.|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) frequently is used {{to determine}} torsional abnormalities. However, its use in clinical practice may be limited. We present a new method for measuring <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> using conventional radiographs. We compared the method with several clinical methods and with CT measurement in 44 lower extremities of 25 subjects. The radiographic method agreed well {{with all of the}} clinical methods, and this agreement was better than agreement between CT and clinical examination. The best agreement was between thigh-foot angle and the radiographic method. The proposed radiographic measurement is a practical method for evaluation of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in outpatient clinics without the need for specialized equipment...|$|R
40|$|Majority of {{paediatric}} flat {{feet are}} flexible and asymptomatic; less than 0. 1 % of all flat feet are rigid. If {{these can be}} diagnosed and managed early, then various complications can be prevented and they will remain asymptomatic. This {{study was conducted to}} analyse the ankle rotational mal-alignments in the natural course of flexible flat foot in children. Seventy-six patients of flexible flat foot and one hundred controls were included in this study. The height of foot arches was judged clinically by inspecting the height of the medial arch and by measuring the arch index on weight-bearing podograms. <b>Tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> and bimalleolar angle were assessed in all subjects. <b>Tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> was assessed in the first twenty subjects (ten cases and ten controls) both by clinical methods (foot-thigh angle) and CT. As no statistical difference in the two methods was observed, <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> was measured by clinical methods only in the remaining subjects. Bimalleolar angle was measured on weight-bearing podograms in all subjects. For a minimum of two years, cases were followed up regularly with a standard conservative protocol and the height of the arches observed. Majority of cases of flexible flat foot were found to have increased <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> and increased foot-bimalleolar angle (high talar spin). The severity of collapse of the medial arch and the response to conservative treatment was found to correlate with these rotational mal-alignments of the ankle. Ankle rotational mal-alignments were seen to make these flexible flat foot deformities more complex and less responsive to conservative treatment...|$|R
30|$|A careful {{clinical}} assessment is most revealing and is paramount to successful clinical management. When the patient stands {{with their feet}} parallel, the patella should be facing forward. The “foot progression angle” should be neutral when walking [12, 17]. When presenting individually, femoral anteversion is manifest by in-toeing and outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> by out-toeing. However, if there is concomitant femoral anteversion and outward <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion,</b> also known as pan genu torsion or “miserable malalignment” [7], the footprint will be neutral and this combined long bone deformity may be concealed to the unwary observer [7]. It is therefore important to have the patient appropriately unclad and note the knee progression angle as well [7, 10, 11].|$|R
40|$|Physical {{examinations}} of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> {{are used for}} preoperative planning and to assess outcomes of tibial osteomy in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). The thigh-foot angle (TFA) and transmalleolar axis (TMA) are commonly used, and the second toe test recently was introduced. However, the validity and reliability of the three methods have not been clarified. This study was performed to evaluate the validity and reliability of these physical measures. We recruited 18 patients (36 limbs) with CP. During reliability sessions, three raters with various levels of orthopaedic experience independently measured <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> using the three different methods during one day before surgery. Validity was assessed by performing a correlation study between physical examination and two-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) findings. Interobserver reliability was greatest for the TMA followed by TFA {{and then by the}} second toe test with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 92, 0. 74, and 0. 57, respectively. In terms of the concurrent validity, the correlation coefficients (r) for the CT measurements were 0. 62, 0. 52, and 0. 55. When depicting <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> by physical examination, all three methods had substantial validity, but test reliability and validity were highest for TMA measurements...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> is an {{important}} anatomical parameter in clinical practice and displays variability among individuals. These variations are extremely significant in view of alignment guides such as those related to rotational landmarks of tibia in total knee arthroplasty. Further, precise knowledge and information pertaining to angle of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> also helps in correction of traumatic malunion or congenital maltorsion of tibia. Methods: The present study was carried out to determine the angle of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in 100 adult dry tibia bones in the Department of Anatomy, Government Medical College, Amritsar. The study group comprised 50 males and 50 females with equal number of right- and left-sided bones. The measurements were meticulously recorded and the data were subjected to statistical analysis. The results were analyzed and discussed {{in the light of}} existing literature. Results: On the right side, it was found to be 29. 84 ° ± 4. 86 °° (range = 22. 00 ° - 38. 00 °) in males and 28. 92 ° ± 5. 10 °° (range = 15. 00 °- 38. 00 °) in females. On the left side, it was found to be 28. 00 ° ± 4. 94 °° (range = 20. 00 °- 40. 00 °°) in males and 28. 12 ° ± 4. 28 °° (range = 20. 00 °- 37. 00 °°) in females. Conclusion: The present study is an endeavor to provide baseline data with reference to the angle of <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> in the Indian population. The results of the study assume special importance in view of the technical advancements in reconstructive surgical procedures in orthopedic practice...|$|R
30|$|All three {{patients}} with six double osteotomies {{were available for}} a follow-up. Subjectively and clinically, all of the patients were reviewed {{at an average of}} 16.3 (range 20 – 12) years after surgery. The following parameters were checked: patient satisfaction, reported knee or hip symptoms, gait, clinical femoral anteversion and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion,</b> return to sport activity. In all patients radiological (CT) femoral anteversion and <b>tibial</b> <b>torsion</b> were studied after surgery. The need for informed consent was waived by the ethical committee since rights and interests of the patients would not be violated and their privacy and anonymity would be assured by this study design. The study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.|$|R
