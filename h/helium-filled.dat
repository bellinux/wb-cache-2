500|$|This {{enabled the}} United States {{to become the}} world's leading {{supplier}} of helium. Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I. The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable, lighter-than-air gas. A total of [...] of 92% helium was produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had previously been obtained. Some of this gas {{was used in the}} world's first <b>helium-filled</b> airship, the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1921, nearly two years before the Navy's first rigid <b>helium-filled</b> airship, the Naval Aircraft Factory-built USS Shenandoah, flew in September 1923.|$|E

500|$|Vindictives {{aircraft}} {{continued to}} support British operations against the Bolsheviks until {{they left the}} Baltic in December, although no further missions were flown from the carrier. They shot down a <b>helium-filled</b> observation balloon and spotted for ships conducted shore bombardments. Most importantly, nine of them attacked Kronstadt during the night of 17/18 August 1919 to provide a diversion for an attack by the CMBs on ships in Kronstadt harbour. As a result, the torpedo boats damaged the battleship [...] and sank Pamiat Azova. In subsequent attacks on Kronstadt, they nearly hit Andrei Pervozvanny {{while she was in}} drydock, nearly hit a minesweeper, killing one crewman from the explosion, and hit two auxiliary ships. By December {{it was clear that the}} Whites' offensive against Petrograd had failed and the British began withdrawing; Vindictive left three Camels in Latvia, embarked the rest of her aircraft and sailed for home on 22 December.|$|E
500|$|Bart was {{described}} as [...] "television's king of 1990", [...] "television's brightest new star" [...] and an [...] "undiminished smash". Entertainment Weekly named Bart the [...] "entertainer of the year" [...] for 1990, writing that [...] "Bart {{has proved to be}} a rebel who's also a good kid, a terror who's easily terrorized, and a flake who astonishes us, and himself, with serious displays of fortitude." [...] In the United States congressional, senatorial and gubernatorial elections of 1990, Bart was one of the most popular write-in candidates, and in many areas was second only to Mickey Mouse amongst fictional characters. In the 1990 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Bart made his debut as one of the giant <b>helium-filled</b> balloons for which the parade is known. The Bart Simpson balloon has appeared at every parade since. This was referenced in The Simpsons in the episode [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", which aired the same day as the parade, where Homer tells Bart, [...] "If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you turn the parade into a farce!" [...] Meanwhile, behind and unbeknownst to him, the television briefly shows a Bart Simpson balloon.|$|E
500|$|Astatine {{is known}} to react with its lighter homologs iodine, bromine, and {{chlorine}} in the vapor state; these reactions produce diatomic interhalogen compounds with formulas AtI, AtBr, and AtCl. The first two compounds may also be produced in water– astatine reacts with iodine/iodide solution to form AtI, whereas AtBr requires (aside from astatine) an iodine/iodine monobromide/bromide solution. The excess of iodides or bromides may lead to [...] and [...] ions, or in a chloride solution, they may produce species like [...] or [...] via equilibrium reactions with the chlorides. Oxidation of the element with dichromate (in nitric acid solution) showed that adding chloride turned the astatine into a molecule likely to be either AtCl or AtOCl.

In a plasma ion source mass spectrometer, the ions +, +, and + have been formed by introducing lighter halogen vapors into a <b>helium-filled</b> cell containing astatine, supporting the existence of stable neutral molecules in the plasma ion state. No astatine fluorides have been discovered yet. Their absence has been speculatively attributed to the extreme reactivity of such compounds, including the reaction of an initially formed fluoride with {{the walls of the}} glass container to form a non-volatile product. Thus, although the synthesis of an astatine fluoride is thought to be possible, it may require a liquid halogen fluoride solvent, as has already been used for the characterization of radon fluoride.|$|E
500|$|The show {{features}} classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, {{in combination}} with atypical elements. Much of the series {{is devoted to the}} science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode [...] "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a <b>helium-filled</b> zeppelin. Campbell told Starlog magazine, [...] "It's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West." [...] The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; {{it is one of the}} few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though [...] "technology-out-of-time" [...] frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.|$|E

Along {{with a group}} of his students, who were known as [...] "McWilliams's Pranksters," [...] he became a well-known presence on the city's avant-garde scene. In 1968, in Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, he presented an event called A Balloon Dance for Children, in which he debuted his composition Sky Kiss—an attempt to levitate while hanging from a bunch of <b>helium-filled</b> balloons. (He did not succeed.) Charlotte Moorman accompanied him by playing a cello that was suspended from a second bunch of balloons.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 a {{distinctive}} method of exploration was invented. In a dome area [...] above the Big Room floor {{not far from}} the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite leaned out. Using a balsa wood loop with <b>helium-filled</b> balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a climbing rope into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World. [...] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.|$|E

The main rotor blades have titanium spars and incorporate a ten degree twist to give an even loading when hovering, while they use a non-symmetrical airfoil section with a drooped leading edge. The rotor tips are tapered and swept back. Flight controls are servo-assisted, with a Stability Augmentation System fitted. A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, which gives the S-76A a [...] increase in cruising speed; emergency flotation gear can be fitted using <b>helium-filled</b> bags to increase buoyancy {{in the event of a}} forced landing on water.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Navy's first <b>helium-filled</b> rigid airship [...] crashing in a storm in September 1925, killing 14 of the crew, {{and the loss of}} three seaplanes on a flight from the West Coast to Hawaii, Mitchell issued a statement accusing senior leaders in the Army and Navy of incompetence and [...] "almost treasonable administration of the national defense." [...] In October 1925, a charge with eight specifications was proffered against Mitchell on the direct order of President Calvin Coolidge, accusing him of violation of the 96th Article of War, an omnibus article that Mitchell's chief counsel, Congressman Frank Reid, declared to be [...] "unconstitutional" [...] as a violation of free speech. The court martial began in early November and lasted for seven weeks.|$|E
2500|$|At Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Hiram {{to operate}} the toy Queen, while the real one is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan's pet cat. The toy Queen {{declares}} Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his tyrannical plans for his new [...] "subjects". After Basil, Dawson and Olivia save Hiram and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget and Ratigan's other henchmen. Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud and tyrant while breaking it into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's treason, start climbing on him and defeating his guards. Ratigan frees himself and escapes on his dirigible with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson and Hiram create their own craft with a matchbox, and some small <b>helium-filled</b> balloons, held together by the Union Jack. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the load, and he attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into the Big Ben clocktower.|$|E
