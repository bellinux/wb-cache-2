5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that <b>electroconvulsive</b> <b>therapy</b> (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since {{the past}} 2 decades, new {{evidence}} for brain plasticity {{has caused a}} shift in both preclinical and clinical ECT research from falsifying the "brain damage hypothesis" toward exploring ECT's enabling brain (neuro) plasticity effects. METHODS: By reviewing the available animal and human literature, we examined the theory that seizure-induced structural changes are crucial for the therapeutic efficacy of ECT. RESULTS: Both animal and human studies suggest <b>electroconvulsive</b> stimulation/electroconvulsive <b>therapy</b> (ECT) -related neuroplasticity (neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis, or gliogenesis). CONCLUSION: It remains unclear whether structural changes might explain the therapeutic efficacy and/or {{be related to the}} (transient) learning and memory impairment after ECT. Methods to assess in vivo brain plasticity of patients treated with ECT will be of particular importance for future longitudinal studies to give support to the currently available correlational data.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the implications of <b>electroconvulsive</b> shock <b>therapy</b> (ECl) for the self and for family relationships. The perspective is interactionist, stressing the meanings of ECT to thos: who have undergone it: their interpretations of its purposes and effects, and its impact on their lives. This viewpoint, which has similarities to a "consumer " view of medical treatment,. contrasts with the medical-model orientation of the psychiatrist ordering shock, and with the organizationai perspective of the nurse administering it. The data for the analysis are intensive interviews with ten women diagnosed as schizophrenic, and with their husbands, during the patient and expatient phases of their moral careers as mental patients (I). These ten women were among 17. admissions to California's Napa State Hospital In 1957 - 1961 who were the focus of a large-scale study of mental hospitalization and the family, the "Bay Area " study (2) ...|$|R
5000|$|To date, {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CBT) is {{the best}} established treatment {{for a variety of}} somatoform disorders including somatization disorder. CBT aims to help patients realize their ailments are not catastrophic and to enable them to gradually return to activities they previously engaged in, without fear of [...] "worsening their symptoms". Consultation and collaboration with the primary care physician also demonstrated some effectiveness. The use of antidepressants is preliminary but does not yet show conclusive evidence. <b>Electroconvulsive</b> shock <b>therapy</b> (ECT) has been used in treating somatization disorder among the elderly; however, the results were still debatable with some concerns around the side effects of using ECT. Overall, psychologists recommend addressing a common difficulty in patients with somatization disorder in the reading of their own emotions. This may be a central feature of treatment; as well as developing a close collaboration between the GP, the patient and the mental health practitioner.|$|R

50|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} supports the predictions of Ribot's Law. The theory concerns the relative strength of memories over time, which is not directly testable. Instead, scientists investigate the processes of forgetting (amnesia), and recollection. Ribot's law states that following a disruptive event, patients will show a temporally graded retrograde amnesia that preferentially spares more distant memories. Experimental evidence largely confirms these predictions. In a study of <b>electroconvulsive</b> shock <b>therapy</b> patients, memories formed at least four years prior to treatment were unaffected, while more recent ones were impaired. An experiment with rats showed similar results. Rats were conditioned to fear stimuli in two different contexts: one 50 days before receiving hippocampal brain lesions, and the other 1 day before lesioning. Subsequently, they only showed fear memory in the 50-day-old context. Many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are also associated with a temporally graded retrograde amnesia, indicating that older memories are somehow strengthened against degeneration while newer memories are not. Although the mechanism for this strengthening is unclear, some models exist to explain the effects.|$|R

50|$|But {{after leaving}} Hollywood for New York City and {{appearing}} in the Group Theatre play, Golden Boy, Frances learns, much to her chagrin, that the Group Theatre exploited her fame only to draw in more customers, replacing her with a wealthy actress for her family's needed financial backing for the play's London tour, and Odets ends their affair upon his wife's (Luise Rainer) upcoming return from Europe. Her desperate attempts to restart her film career upon returning to Hollywood results in being cast in unchallenging roles in forgettable B-films. Her increased dependence on alcohol and amphetamines in the 1940s and the pressures brought on her by her wannabe mother, who becomes her legal guardian after her multiple legal problems, result in a complete nervous breakdown. After her first hospitalization at Kimball Sanitarium in La Crescenta, she tells her mother that she doesn't {{want to return to}} Hollywood but instead wants to live alone in the countryside, assaulting and threatening her in the resulting argument. While institutionalized at Western State Hospital, Frances is abused by the powers-that-be: she is forced to undergo insulin and <b>electroconvulsive</b> shock <b>therapy,</b> is cruelly beaten, periodically raped by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily lobotomized before her release in 1950.|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{stress or}} {{an excess of}} {{glucocorticoids}} can exacerbate neuronal damage in response to insults and, in severe cases, can lead to neuronal atrophy and death. These effects {{are thought to be}} related to the actions of stress and glucocorticoids on glutamate function, neuronal metabolism, and the generation of cytotoxic free radicals. Recent studies demonstrate that the regulation of neurotrophic factors may contribute to the actions of stress on neuronal function. Acute or chronic stress decreases the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor, the most abundant neurotrophin in the brain, in specific regions of the hippocampus, and other forebrain regions. In addition, chronic stress increases the expression of neurotrophin- 3 in certain regions of the hippocampus and may, thereby, help to protect these regions from the neurotoxic effects of chronic stress. The deleterious effects of stress may contribute to psy-chiatric illnesses, such as depression, that can be precipitated or worsened by stress and that are often characterized by hypercortisolism. <b>Electroconvulsive</b> seizure <b>therapy,</b> as well as antidepressant drugs, increase the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor, trkB, in the brain, demon-strating that neurotrophins are a target of antidepressant treatments.

5000|$|In {{a chapter}} titled [...] "Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences" [...] {{of his book}} Psychodiagnosis: Selected Papers (1973), {{psychologist}} Paul Meehl describes several logical fallacies that may arise {{in the context of}} medical case conferences, including hidden decisions that health professionals (and people in general) tend to make about others. Meehl discusses YAVIS among the biases that lead to hidden decisions, and he specifically points to the fact that research has shown that clients of a lower socioeconomic status are more likely to receive medication or <b>electroconvulsive</b> or supportive <b>therapy.</b> Middle and upper class clients (or those seen as more “successful”), on the other hand, are more likely to receive intensive, long-term psychotherapy. Meehl outlines that the latter types of treatments are generally more in line with the interests and theoretical frameworks of most practicing psychologists. Meehl uses this example to illustrate that psychotherapists may unknowingly give preferential treatment to clients of higher SES, or individuals with other YAVIS characteristics.|$|R
40|$|<b>Electroconvulsive</b> seizure <b>therapy</b> (ECS) is a {{clinically}} proven {{treatment for}} depression {{and is often}} effective even in patients resistant to chemical antidepressants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of ECS are not fully understood. One theory that has gained attention is that ECS and other antidepressants increase the expression of select neurotrophic factors that could reverse or block the atrophy and cell loss resulting from stress and depression. To further address this topic, we examined the expression of other neurotrophic – growth factors and related signaling pathways in the hippocampus in response to ECS using a custom growth factor microarray chip. We report the regulation of several genes {{that are involved in}} growth factor and angiogenic – endothelial signaling, including neuritin, stem cell factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VGF (nonacronymic), cyclooxygenase- 2, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase- 1. Some of these, as well as other growth factors identified, including VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have roles in mediating neurogenesis and cell proliferation in the adult brain. We also examined gene expression in the choroid plexus and found several growth factors that are enriched in this vascular tissue as well as regulated by ECS. These data suggest that an amplification of growth factor signaling combined with angiogenic mechanisms could have {{an important role in the}} molecular action of ECS. This study demonstrates the applicability of custom-focused microarray technology in addressing hypothesis-driven questions regarding the action of antidepressants.
