50|$|Contagion default {{modeling}} can {{be viewed}} as a variation of CID modeling. As discussed in section 2.3, in the CID framework, correlation is modeled by conditioning on a common market factor M, which impacts all entities to the same degree. The lower the random drawing for M, the higher is the <b>default</b> intensity <b>of</b> all entities (unless ρ = 0). Hence CID modeling can elucidate default clustering. In contrast, contagion approaches model the <b>default</b> intensity <b>of</b> an entity as a function <b>of</b> the <b>default</b> <b>of</b> another entity. Hence contagion default modeling incorporates counterparty risk, i.e. the direct impact <b>of</b> a <b>defaulting</b> entity on the <b>default</b> intensity <b>of</b> another entity. In particular, after a <b>default</b> <b>of</b> a particular entity, the <b>default</b> intensity <b>of</b> all assets in the portfolio increases. This default contagion then typically fades exponentially to non-contagious default intensity levels. See the papers of Davis and Lo (2001) and Jarrow and Yu (2001), who pioneered contagion default modeling.|$|R

40|$|Given the {{criticality}} of {{the supplier}} {{network and the}} increasing number <b>of</b> supplier <b>defaults,</b> automotive OEMs are well advised to actively manage their supplier networks, consider supply risks, and avoid negative and exploit positive consequences <b>of</b> supplier <b>defaults.</b> We aim to extend the research on supplier defaults along two dimensions: First, with a few exceptions, previous {{studies have focused on}} the <b>default</b> consequences <b>of</b> individual suppliers. However, since suppliers do not operate in isolation, their financial situation is often interlinked. We argue that default dependence (also default correlation) exists in supplier networks and that OEMs should manage the entire network as a group and consider interdependencies among suppliers. Second, all studies that have considered default dependencies have exclusively modeled positive dependence, i. e., they have assumed that, given two suppliers 1 and 2, the <b>default</b> <b>of</b> supplier 2 is positively related to the <b>default</b> <b>of</b> supplier 1.
