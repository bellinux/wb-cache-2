50|$|The {{nerve damage}} {{associated}} with the disease was first thought {{to be caused by}} metabolic changes such as endoneurial microvessel disease, which is the degeneration of pericytes due to hyperglycemia, and the reproduction of basement membranes when the pericytes are no longer regulating their cell cycle. The decreased size of the lumen plus the absence of the pericyte, which regulate capillary blood flow and phagocytosis of cellular debris, leads to ischemia. Nerve biopsies have shifted the view toward an <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism</b> that causes Micro Vasculitis, which could eventually lead to ischemia. Experimental treatments using immunosuppressive proteins have provided further corroborative evidence to the <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism</b> theory. Although this disease does occur in patients without diabetes the prevalence is much greater in the diabetic indicating that although hyperglycemia does not directly cause the nerve damage it may play a role.|$|E

50|$|Most {{children}} will experience a relapsing form of OMS, though a minority {{will have a}} monophasic course and {{may be more likely}} to recover without residual deficits. Viral infection may play a role in the reactivation of disease in some patients who had previously experienced remission, possibly by expanding the memory B cell population. Studies have generally asserted that 70-80% of children with OMS will have long-term neurologic, cognitive, behavioral, developmental, and academic impairment. Since neurologic and developmental difficulties have not been reported as a consequence of neuroblastoma or its treatment, it is thought that these are exclusively due to the <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism</b> underlying OMS.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which {{determine}} the infection duration induced by pathogens targeting pulmonary macrophages are poorly known. To explore {{the impact of}} such pathogens, it is indispensable to integrate the various <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and {{to take into account}} the variability in pathogen virulence and host susceptibility. In this context, mathematical models complement experimentation and are powerful tools to represent and explore the complex mechanisms involved in the infection and immune dynamics. We developed an original mathematical model in which we detailed the interactions between the macrophages and the pathogen, the orientation of the adaptive response and the cytokine regulations. We applied our model to the Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome virus (PRRSv), a major concern for the swine industry. We extracted value ranges for the model parameters from modelling and experimental studies on respiratory pathogens. We identified the most influential parameters through a sensitivity analysis. We defined a parameter set, the reference scenario, resulting in a realistic and representative immune response to PRRSv infection. We then defined scenarios corresponding to graduated levels of strain virulence and host susceptibility around the reference scenario. We observed that high levels of antiviral cytokines and a dominant cellular response were associated with either short, the usual assumption, or long infection durations, depending on the <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms</b> involved. To identify these mechanisms, we need to combine the levels of antiviral cytokines, including IFN c, and IL 10. The latter is a good indicator of the infected macrophage level, both combined provide the adaptive response orientation. Available PRRSv vaccines lack efficiency. By integrating the main interactions between the complex <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> this modelling framework could be used to help designing more efficient vaccination strategies...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the ability}} of {{mosquitoes}} to limit Plasmodium infection is well documented, many questions remain as to how malaria parasites are recognized and killed by the mosquito host. Recent evidence suggests that anti-Plasmodium immunity is multimodal, with different <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms</b> regulating ookinete and oocyst survival. However, most experiments {{determine the number of}} mature oocysts, without considering that different <b>immune</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may target different developmental stages of the parasite. Complement-like proteins have emerged as important determinants of early immunity targeting the ookinete stage, yet the mechanisms by which the mosquito late-phase immune response limits oocyst survival are less understood. Here, we describe the known components of the mosquito immune system that limit oocyst development, and provide insight into their possible mechanisms of action...|$|R

50|$|Aspirin {{and other}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAID) can cause NSAID-exacerbated diseases (N-ERD). These have been recently classified into 5 groups 3 {{of which are}} not caused by a classical <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism</b> and {{are relevant to the}} function of ALOX5: 1) NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD), i.e. symptoms of bronchial airways obstruction, shortness of breath, and/or nasal congestion/rhinorrhea occurring shortly after NSAID ingestion in patients with a history of asthma and/or rhinosinusitis; 2) NSAIDs-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD), i.e. wheal responses and/or angioedema responses occurring shortly after NSAID ingestion in patients with a history of chronic urticaria; and 3) NSAIDs-induced urticaria/angioedema (NIUA) (i.e. wheals and/or angioedema symptoms occurring shortly after NSAID ingestion in patients with no history of chronic urticaria). The genetic polymorphism Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant in the ALOX5 gene, ALOX5-1708 G>A is associated with NSAID-induced asthma in Korean patients and three SNP ALOX5 variants, rs4948672, rs1565096, and rs7894352, are associated with NSAID-induced cutaneous reactions in Spanish patients.|$|E

"Blood-induced icterus" [...] {{produced}} by the release of massive amounts of a coloring material from blood cells followed by the formation of bile was recognized and described by Vanlair and Voltaire Masius' in 1871. About 20 years later, Hayem distinguished between congenital hemolytic anemia and an acquired type of infectious icterus associated with chronic splenomegaly. In 1904, Donath and Landsteiner suggested a serum factor was responsible for hemolysis in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. French investigators led by Chauffard {{stressed the importance of}} red-cell autoagglutination in patients with acquired hemolytic anemia. In 1930, Lederer and Brill described cases of acute hemolysis with rapid onset of anemia and rapid recovery after transfusion therapy. These hemolytic episodes were thought to be due to infectious agents. A clear distinction between congenital and acquired hemolytic anemia was not drawn, however, until Dameshek and Schwartz in 1938, and, in 1940, they demonstrated the presence of abnormal hemolysins in the sera of patients with acquired hemolytic anemia and postulated an <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Studies to {{determine}} the evolutionary origins of vertebrates have led to understanding the development of immune system processes and furthermore answer the questions {{of how and why}} pathogens have learned to evade and shut down these selectable genetic traits. Eight functional and four pseudo IRG genes have been identified in the invertebrate Branchiostoma floridiae. [...] Li et al. determined expression patterns of functional IFN-inducible GTPase genes in Branchiostoma japonicum at various immunologic sites when induced by pathogens and pathogenic substances. This evidence suggests that IRGs may function in an immune-related capacity in cephalochordates. The paradox remains that these IRGs function without induction by IFN activation pathways, since B. japonicum and other amphioxus species do not possess IFN and IFN receptor genes. [...] It is possible that IRGs may have existed prior to the Cambrian Explosion as an innate <b>immune</b> <b>mechanism</b> and with the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, IFN evolved to modulate IRG function. Vertebrates have evolved an array of IRG genes as a whole, potentially due to the evolution between variable pathogen interactions. The C57BL/6 mouse has 23 IRG genes of which 21 may be functional in resistance to pathogens (6 are well characterized), whereas humans have evolved only 1 functional IRG gene (IRGM) and one pseudogene.
