According to the three-dimension finite difference method and regulating calculation method, the excavation seepage analysis of anchorage circular foundation at Huangpu bridge south {{and the influence of}} different depth rock-socketed on foundation seepage are discussed. With the experience in similar projects at home and abroad, the depth of diaphragm wall embedded in weak weathered rock is not less than 3 meters, <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> consists of 10 meters, and the waterproof curtain outside the foundation is canceled from preliminary design. The stress, strain and water level are monitored during the excavation process, and the deformation of the supporting structure is within the control. The structure is under reasonable force and the sealing effect is obvious when the foundation is excavated.

A 20 ft (1.86 m) deep low pressure consolidation <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> was installed on the upstream side of the dame and extending into both abutments to improve {{the strength of the}} rock under the dam and prevent leaks. Drainage holes were constructed just downstream of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> as well as under the power house with 40 pressure gauges installed to record the up pressure on the structure.|$|R
50|$|As {{the lake}} {{began to fill}} {{increasing}} levels of water began to flow from the drainage channels behind the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> in the right abutment, which indicated that the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> was faulty. Investigations concluded that further grouting {{would have to be}} performed (which took about a fortnight) before the lake could be raised it its final level. The decision was made to allow the lake to fill to no further than the crest of the spillway while the contractors began drilling and inserting more grout.|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} the authors {{considered}} {{the technique of}} evaluating {{the performance of a}} <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> basing on the analysis of mathematical forecasting and regular measurements of water temperature in the reservoir and in the rock mass behind the dam. The initial data for the solution of heat transfer problem are the rate of filtration, obtained from the solution of the stationary problem of filtration, and the experimental factor, generalizing thermophysical properties of rocks. For calculating the period of time from to the change of the water temperature in the reservoir till the change of water temperature at the reference point of the rock mass a computer program was designed, which allows defining the path and time of filtration from the reservoir to the reference point in the rock mass {{with the help of the}} reverse conversion on flow lines. The calculation was carried out from the point in question in the rock mass till the crossing paths of filtration with the bottom boundary of the reservoir. As an example, we present the results of computational studies of filtration and temperature regimes in the rock foundation of a concrete dam at the design work of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> and in case of the presence of pervious area. The calculations were performed with a time step dt = 2 days. At each time step, with account of water motion along the lines of the current through the rock mass, the previous position of the reference points in space has been determined, for which the value of the velocity vector of filtration field was corrected. In the first case, the motion of water from the reservoir was carried out in the circumvention of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain.</b> In the second case, the motion of water took place from the reservoir through the permeable portion of the <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain.</b> The change of the water temperature during its seepage from the water reservoir through permeable area of <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> because of conductive heat transmission in all the checkpoints in permeable area of <b>grouting</b> <b>curtain</b> is 0. 5 - 1. 0 °C at measurement accuracy of water temperature 0. 1 °C.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} widely used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems. Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. The state of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system, the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. It is recommended that the certificates of a <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system should show the frame ratio that was applied during testing or the accurate Ucw value considering actual frame ratio should be submitted for more reasonable building energy simulation...|$|R

40|$|A {{sustained}} pace {{of construction}} of dams and dikes using water resources and intensive development of underground {{space in the}} construction of buildings and structures require ensuring anti-seepage measures. For efficient stoppage of fluid flow a variety of methods are applied such as cement and <b>grout</b> <b>curtains,</b> teeth, core <b>walls</b> including ones made of soil-cement mixtures performed by the method of diaphragm wall. The following characteristics are the main selection criteria of the material composition for a diaphragm wall : permeability, strength, deformability, efficiency. Clay-cement-concrete (CCC) is one of the materials satisfying all the above characteristics. The influence of the components used to prepare CCC mixtures on its strength and deformation characteristics was the main objective of the performed study. In order to solve the task, the formulas of CCC used at the objects of hydroengineering construction have been considered. For analyzing the influence of the components of CCC on its characteristics, the dependences of compression strength and deformation modulus of CCC on water-cement and water-astringent ratios have been built. The dependence of compression strength of CCC on the cement/bentonite ratio was built as well. The analysis of the dependences defined that the compression strength of CCC depends primarily on water-cement ratio and the amount of cement used in the composition. The increase in the value of water-cement ratio and water-astringent ratio leads to monotone decrease of the compression strength of CCC and the deformation modulus of CCC. Change of the quantitative content of one or more components of CCC composition allows controlling physical-mechanical characteristics of the anti-seepage element which is an important advantage of clay-cement-concrete. The performed analysis of the influence of CCC formula on its physical and mechanical properties can be used to select the optimal composition of CCC when solving specific hydroengineering tasks...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} facing dam is the repair of their structures to prevent the seepage under them. In previous years, many existing dams have been treated by grouting, but {{with varying degrees of}} success. One {{of the major}} reasons for this erratic performance is the unsuitable selection of the grouting materials to reduce the seepage. Grouting is an effective way to strengthen of the permeability of the soil to reduce the seepage. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on the efficiency of current available grouting materials and techniques from construction, environmental and economical point of view. The seepage reduction usually accomplished by either chemical grouting or cementious grouting using ultrafine cement. In addition, the study shows a comparison between grouting materials according to their degree of permeability reduction and cost. The application of seepage reduction is based on the permeation <b>grouting</b> using <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> installation. The computer program (SEEP/W) is employed to model a dam rested on sandy soil, using <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> to reduce seepage quantity and hydraulic gradient by different grouting materials.

40|$|The {{permeability}} of the rockmass is {{an important}} parameter for a dam. Mostly, an underground sealing is required to reduce seepage, which originates from a high permeability to an admissible amount. Further purposes of an underground sealing are to obtain sufficient stability against piping and to limit the uplift under the downstream located shell. The success of an underground sealing depends on geological conditions and technical parameters. These relations were investigated for the Bigge dam which presents an excellently documented example. The data of Lugeon tests and groutings are correlated by means of statistical measures with the geological conditions. Furthermore the long-term stability of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> is checked by {{an evaluation of the}} seepage records since impounding. At the Bigg dam, completed in 1965, the underground sealing consists of a concrete sealing up to 10 - 15 m depth in the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass. At the bottom of the concrete sealing the accessible control gallery is integrated. From this gallery the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> was drilled into the bedrock up to a maximum depth of 85 m below ground level. The results of the investigations can be summarised as follows: - By the concrete sealing in the upper section the total grouting work was considerably reduced and an optimum sealing in the critical weathering and disintegration zone was obtained. - According to the concrete sealing of the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass the solid take of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> came to an average values of only 30 kg per running meter of borehole with extreme variations between the different sections of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> (max. in the A-row about 3800 kg/m). The water take in the Lugeon tests decreased from 4 Lugeon in the A-row (max. about 60 Lugeon), before grouting, up to 0. 45 Lugeon in the control borings, after grouting. This means a reduction of 89 %. - The average seepage through the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> comes only to 4. 28 l/s. - The hydrostatic pressure in the foundation was completely lowered below the downstream shell, or it was reduced to 6 % of the upstream head, respectively. - The results indicate that effectiveness of the <b>grout</b> <b>curtain</b> was completely preserved during the 30 years of operation. The seepage is about 16 % lower than at the time of impounding in 1965. Due to these favourable results of the inspection, longer intervals of monitoring and a {{reduction in the number of}} measuring points of the current extensive monitoring system can be recommended. In addition, supplementary sealing is not necessary. (orig.)
