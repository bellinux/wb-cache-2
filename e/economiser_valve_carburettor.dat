50|$|The now-oversquare {{modified}} engine used the 650 Bonneville twin-carb cylinder head having bigger <b>valves,</b> ports and <b>carburettors</b> than a standard Triumph 500, allowing for efficient air-fuel intake at racing speeds. The 650-size crank journals and main bearings were {{larger than a}} 500 which allowed for greater reliability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) {{is the most}} {{successful}} and widely used alternative fuel for vehicles in the market today. Petrol fuelled vehicles are fitted with natural gas vehicle (NGV) conversion kit to enable bi-fuel operation between CNG and petrol. This experimental approach {{is focused on the}} fuel consumption, exhaust emission and fuel cost between natural gas and petrol operations. The specially constructed test rig comprises of the bi-fuel fuel system employed in the 1500 cc 12 <b>valves</b> <b>carburettor</b> engine NGV taxis. The inherent fuel consumption and corresponding exhaust emission are acquired at different engine revolution per minute (rpm) during petrol and CNG operation separately. The engine rpm operating without load is varied from idle to more than 5000 rpm to acquire the fuel consumption and exhaust emission profile. These two acquired data are then used to calculate the engine’s air fuel ratio. All three parameters acquired are used to conduct comparisons between petrol and natural gas operation. It is seen that the bi-fuel system operates with air fuel ratio ranging from 19 to 16. 3 for petrol operation and ranges from 40 to 18. 7 for natural gas operations. The emission during CNG operation clearly shows significant decrease in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) over the use of petrol. In terms of cost, the use of CNG provides savings exceeding 50 % through all engine rpm compared to petrol non-loaded operations...|$|R
50|$|Cox {{reed valve}} engines are nearly indestructible. The needle <b>valve</b> and <b>carburettor</b> {{are behind the}} {{cylinder}} where they are protected, and the crank case, cylinder and fuel tank are all machined from forgings, rather than weaker castings. The tank back plate/carburettor is a zinc alloy casting, or later a plastic casting, but crash stresses are already well distributed {{by the time they}} reach it. The claim of dimensional tolerance, in the advertisement shown above, is justified by the facts that the high production volume engines need no break-in, except for a one-minute rich run, and any piston will fit into any cylinder that is the same size.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that the}} float <b>valve</b> of a <b>carburettor</b> (controlling {{the fuel level}} within the carburettor) is not a needle valve, {{although}} it is commonly described as one. It uses a bluntly conical needle, but it seats against a square-edged seat rather than a matching cone. The intention here is to obtain a well-defined seat between two narrow mating surfaces, giving firm shutoff of the flow from only a light float pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The Aston Martin V8 Vantage {{was hailed}} at its 1977 {{introduction}} as [...] "Britain's First Supercar" [...] for its 170 mi/h km/h top speed. Its engine was {{shared with the}} Lagonda, but it used high-performance camshafts, increased compression ratio, larger inlet <b>valves</b> and bigger <b>carburettors</b> mounted on new manifolds for increased output. Straight-line performance {{was the best of}} the day, with acceleration from 0-60 mi/h km/h in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the Ferrari Daytona.|$|R
50|$|By 1889, de Dion was {{becoming}} convinced the future {{lay in the}} internal combustion engine, and the company had built a ten-cylinder two-row rotary. After Trépardoux resigned in 1894, the company became De Dion, Bouton et Compagnie. For 1895, Bouton created a new 137 cc (8.4 in3) one-cylinder engine with trembler coil ignition. Proving troublesome at its designed speed of 900 rpm (throwing bearings and running rough), when Bouton increased the revs, the problems vanished. In trials, it achieved an unprecedented 3500 rpm, and was usually run at 2,000 rpm, a limit imposed by its atmospheric <b>valves</b> and surface <b>carburettor.</b> Inlet and exhaust valves were overhead, and a flywheel was fitted to {{each end of the}} crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|Negative G {{commonly}} {{occurs when}} manoeuvring to fire on an enemy aircraft in a dogfight. Moving the stick forward would starve {{the engine of}} fuel, producing a sudden loss of power. This would let the enemy get away, and if continued the manoeuvre would cause the <b>carburettor</b> <b>valve</b> to open, provide far too rich a mixture and stop the engine. During the Battles of France and Britain, the German fighter aeroplanes had fuel injected engines and therefore did not suffer from this problem as the fuel injection pumps kept the fuel at a constant pressure whatever manoeuvres were made. The German pilots could exploit this by pitching steeply forward while pushing the throttle wide open, the pursuing British aircraft being left flat footed since trying to emulate the manoeuvre would result in loss of power, or fuel flooding and engine shutdown. The British countermeasure, a half roll so the aircraft would only be subjected to positive G as they followed German aircraft into a dive, could take enough time to let the enemy escape.|$|R
5000|$|The {{category}} {{was introduced by}} the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport to take effect from January 1960. Prior {{to the introduction of}} Appendix J, there had been no national regulations for touring car racing in Australia with individual race promoters applying differing rules regarding eligibility and modification of the cars being raced. Under Appendix J, eligibility was restricted to closed cars with seating for four persons and at least one hundred examples of the model had to have been produced. [...] Bodywork and interior trim had to remain virtually standard; however, engines and suspensions could be modified to improve performance and handling. Modifications were permitted in the areas of <b>carburettors,</b> <b>valves,</b> pistons, camshafts, inlet systems, exhaust systems, springs and shock absorbers. Cars competed in numerous classes based on engine capacity with the regulations allowing an increase in capacity up to the limit of the relevant class. Many highly modified cars which were no longer eligible to compete as Touring Cars found a home in another new CAMS category, Appendix K. [...] This was ostensibly for GT cars but in reality allowed virtually any form of closed vehicle to participate ...|$|R
50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly <b>valve</b> in the <b>carburettor</b> (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|R
