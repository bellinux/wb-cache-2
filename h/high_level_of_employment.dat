From a policy perspective, we provide support for the findings of previous Australian researchers that <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> specialisation are associated with better labour market outcomes in a region, and that when policymakers assess different regional-development policies, they should give some consideration {{as to whether or not}} the implementation of their preferred policy will have an impact upon employment specialisation in the particular region. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{consequences}} of {{an increase in}} the minimum wage for foreign workers in the construction sector, implied by the EU Posted Workers Directive, are analyzed. Due to the rising price of construction services, the factor demand for both construction services and capital in the tradeable good sector falls, and the wage rate in this sector declines. While the share of domestic workers increases with respect to both foreign workers and capital in the construction sector, this need not suffice to reduce unemployment.

In this regard, the main challenge would be to find a labour market regulation able {{at the same time}} to eliminate the disincentive to hire and to motivate firms and workers towards more stable and productive job relationships.|$|R
50|$|The dialect of the Scots {{language}} spoken in Lossiemouth was {{closely related to}} the Doric dialect that was prevalent in Aberdeenshire. Many variations of this dialect can be heard along the Grampian coast, identifiable dialects from towns as close as 5 miles apart (i.e. Lossiemouth and Hopeman) is not unheard of. Just as the Doric is in decline, however, so it is in Lossiemouth. The reasons for this include the demise of Lossiemouth as a fishing port where its fishermen used Scots extensively. In fishing towns such as Peterhead and Fraserburgh, Scots is still widely spoken. In Lossiemouth, though, the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at the RAF station and a large population of non-Scots (nearly 25%) has hastened this decline. Quite a lot of the words still remain in use but on the whole, Scottish English is increasingly spoken among the indigenous population.|$|E
50|$|First, a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{protection}} regulations causes {{employers to}} be cautious about hiring more than a minimum number of workers, since they cannot easily be laid off during a downturn, or fired if a new employee should {{turn out to be}} unmotivated or incompetent. Second, the development of temporary forms of work such as internships, seasonal jobs and short term contracts have left young workers in precarious situations. Because their jobs are temporary contracts, youth are often the first to be laid off when a company downsizes. If they are laid off, youth are typically not eligible for redundancy payments because they only worked with the company {{for a short period of}} time. Once this work ends, many find themselves unemployed and disadvantaged in the job search. However, some youth are entering work on a part-time basis during tertiary education. This rate is low in countries like Italy, Spain and France but in the United States almost one-third of students combine education and work.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{conditions}} of [...] "taut planning", {{the economy was}} expected to produce a volume of output higher than the reported capacity of enterprises {{and there was no}} [...] "slack" [...] in the system. Enterprises faced a resource constraint and hoarded labour and other inputs and avoided sub-contracting intermediate production activities, preferring to retain the work in-house. The enterprise, according to the theory promulgated by János Kornai, was constrained by its resources not by the demand for its goods and services; nor was it constrained by its finances since the government was not likely to shut it down if it failed to meet its financial targets. Enterprises in socialist planned economies operated within a [...] "soft" [...] budget constraint, unlike enterprises in capitalist market economies which are demand-constrained and operate within [...] "hard" [...] budget constraints, as they face bankruptcy if their costs exceed their sales. As all producers were working in a resource-constrained economy they were perpetually in short supply and the shortages could never be eliminated, leading to chronic disruption of production schedules. The effect of this was to preserve a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] As in all market economies, wage {{bargaining}} in the European Union Member States {{is fundamental to}} enabling labour as a factor of production to obtain {{its fair share of}} the production output (and thereby participate in prosperity) and to securing a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the economy (thereby supporting aggregate demand and contributing to social inclusion). In the EU, around two-thirds of workers are covered by some form of collective agreement, which demonstrates the importance of {{wage bargaining}} to macroeconomic outcomes in the European social model. This report provides a quantitative analysis of how the features of national wage-bargaining regimes affect pay outcomes. The analysis builds on the theoretical propositions that both highly centralised and highly decentralised regimes align wages and productivity, ensuring a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> and that a high degree of coordination of wage bargaining can moderate wage increases, leading to macroeconomic stability...|$|E
