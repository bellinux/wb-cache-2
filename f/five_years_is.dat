5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E

25|$|GERD {{may lead}} to Barrett's esophagus, a type of {{intestinal}} metaplasia, which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer.

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of {{pancreatic}} cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which affects the exocrine part of the pancreas, {{is by far the}} most common form. [...] The many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have varied outlooks. [...] However the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply; it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection, especially through medical imaging, of tumors that would be very slow to develop. Insulinomas (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types. In the United States pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer. The disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new cases in 2012. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively. In localized disease where the cancer is small (< 2nbsp&cm) the number alive at <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> approximately 20%. For those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>is</b> much better at 65%, varying considerably with type.|$|E
