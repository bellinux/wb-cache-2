40|$|This article {{examines}} the professional development of new Higher Education teachers using the analytical framework of communities of practice theory. Contextualized within the embryonic Higher Education national framework of professional teaching standards (NFPTS), it compares and contrasts centralized professional development approaches with those decentralized in what Malcolm and Zukas refer to as departmental ‘situated pedagogy’. The discussion then problematizes such situated approaches by highlighting the difficulties of ‘accounting for change’ in localized departmental communities of practice. By employing a formative taxonomy of professional development practice for new Higher Education teachers, the paper concludes by emphasizing {{the need to maintain}} ‘cross-sector’ learning between centralized and <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities</b> of practice in the pursuit of teaching and learning improvement and innovation...|$|R

50|$|Treated as a {{separate}} and elite community by the Tsar, the Cossacks rewarded his government with strong loyalty. His administration frequently used Cossack units to suppress domestic disorder, especially during the Russian Revolution of 1905. The Imperial Government depended heavily on the perceived reliability of the Cossacks. By the early 20th century, their <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities</b> and semi-feudal military service were coming {{to be seen as}} obsolete. The Russian Army Command, which had worked to professionalize its forces, considered the Cossacks as less well disciplined, trained and mounted than the hussars, dragoons, and lancers of the regular cavalry. The Cossack qualities of initiative and rough-riding skills were not always fully appreciated. As a result, Cossack units were frequently broken up into small detachments for use as scouts, messengers or picturesque escorts.|$|R
40|$|The global {{information}} {{service in the}} Internet is a heterogeneous and rapidly evolving environment. Users ’ interests and demands for {{information service}}s are rapidly changing.

Therefore, an Autonomous <b>Decentralized</b> <b>Community</b> Information Systems (ADCIS) [1] was proposed to meet the rapidly changing users ’ requirements for services and cope with the extreme dynamism of the operating environment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a logical {{framework}} for modelling obligations and permissions regulating <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities</b> of heterogeneous agents. Since there is no central design in such virtual communities, it is necessary to express global policies concerning the local policies regulating the local resources. We address this problem in a logical framework for normative multiagent systems which is based on three ideas. First, we distinguish between agents whose behavior is governed by norms and autonomous normative agents who establish and enforce the policies. Second, we distinguish some of the usual mental attitudes for all agents, including the normative agents. Third, we distinguish between behavior that counts as a violation and sanctions. To formalize decision making we use a qualitative game theory. n-player games are based on recursive modelling: the bearer of a norm models the behavior of local normative authorities as agents who are in turn subject to other norms and thus model global normative agents...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{information}} services {{in accordance with}} users ' preference, utilization place and time are required more and more. Autonomous <b>Decentralized</b> <b>Community</b> System (ADCS) has been proposed to provide services for a Local Majority, which consists of users who have similar preferences or are in a similar situation. ADCS network consists of many autonomous stationary nodes that support wireless communication to users ’ mobile terminals and the network covers lands. Cooperation among nodes achieves flexibility {{of the system and}} allows users in a Local Majority to cooperate mutually and share information. In ADCS various services, which are created by users or service providers (SP), are allocated on the network and their positions are unpredictable. To utilize services, the distributive service discovery technology, which limits request forwarding with TTL, is available. However, it has problem on response time. This paper proposes the service discovery technology that does not limit query forwards but make reply messages as cancel massages that stop request forwarding follow and catch up with request messages by cooperation among nodes based on Autonomous <b>Decentralized</b> <b>Community</b> System concept. The effectiveness of proposal on response time is shown by simulation. 1...|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} methodologies that enable direct {{comparison}} of centralized and decentralized sewage treatment systems, both in economical and ecological view.

LCA is largely quantitative in nature and thus can help in selecting strategies that solve environmental problems rather than merely shifting them back and forth. In the present study, an LCA comparison of several treatment processes for small and <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities</b> is made.

40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of democracy in}} many sub-Saharan African countries in the early 1990 s ushered in a new local governance perspective that is hinged on decentralization, emphasizing people-centred and participatory approaches within the Humanist development paradigm. At community level, the implementation of this development approach posed a challenge of synergizing enduring indigenous local governance institutions and the formal institutions. Using the case of Sinyala community forest management in rural Malawi, the paper argues that the {{introduction of}} <b>decentralized</b> <b>community</b> based forest management in Sinyala was undermined seriously {{because it did not}} adequately engage with and incorporate indigenous community governance institutions and community members’ expectations. As a result, there have been institutional incompatibilities and discontinuities hence disequilibrium between the formal and indigenous local institutions. The paper also shows that community development activities, including the community based forest management, are not properly synergized in Sinyala community because of disjointed initiatives by formal meso-level actors. Given the exogenous nature of the <b>decentralized</b> <b>community</b> based forest management regime, much as its introduction was participatory, the paper notes the increasing levels of dependency and need for incentives in participation among community members in community forest management and indeed many community development activities. To improve community collective action and development within a decentralized framework therefore, this research paper argues that community development efforts need to engage with and build on existing indigenous institutions, provide relevant and appropriate incentives to boost community participation, build and strengthen cross-community governance institutions where a common property resource overlaps two or more communities, and implement a coherent community development policy that will synergize community development efforts from different actors at all levels of governance...|$|E

We show that this approach decreases complexity and can substantially improve performance. We compare the performance, generality and complexity of our algorithms with non-economic algorithms. To validate the usefulness of our approach, we present economies that solve three distinct resource management problems encountered in large, distributed systems. The first economy performs CPU load balancing and demonstrates how our approach limits complexity and effectively allocates resources when compared to non-economic algorithms. We show that the economy achieves better performance than a representative non-economic algorithm. The load balancing economy spa [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{has become}} one of the main development agendas of the twenty first century worldwide. But, the identification targeting of poor has been facing fundamental problems due to the lack of required information. Using the micro-level estimation technique we estimate household expenditure for the census households using 1995 / 96 and 2003 / 04 household surveys, and estimate different measures of poverty and inequality using the estimated expenditure for those two years at the country level as well as at the regional, districts and village levels, and for the different caste/ethnic households. The public good aspects of this research is that these measures can be used as a guide for formulating decentralization and fiscal policies for <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities</b> across Nepal. Despite the indication that the aggregate level of poverty went down by 10 percentage points during the past eight years (1995 / 96 – 2003 / 04), our findings indicate that the reduction is not uniform in the first place, and the level of poverty actually went up in the significant part of the country. The increased poverty accompanied by the accelerating inequality throughout the country has compounded the divide between the haves and the have-nots and provided a suitable atmosphere for the conflict. As the foremost contributors of rising inequality are enterprise income and remittance, and agriculture income, high school and college level education help to reduce it, there are some clear policy implications of our findings that focusing on agricultural sector, high school and college education along with fiscal policy-mix (tax-transfer) could address the rising inequality and poverty...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{historical}} {{analysis of a}} public housing project built in Greenbelt, Maryland in 1937, this dissertation investigates how federal housing policies attempted to impose middle-class gender roles and relations on members of the working-class as a central means to alleviate class tensions heightened during the Great Depression. Informed by recent developments in Women's History and the Social History of Architecture, this project examines how attempts to rehabilitate working-class families and communities necessitated removing them from cities and imposing paradigmatic gender norms. A new form of housing and town-planning became a critical means to achieve these ends. This federal housing project in Greenbelt has long been celebrated as the first successful example of federal support for progressive urban planning. The planners of Greenbelt drew from existing progressive ideologies that understood <b>decentralized</b> <b>communities,</b> or suburbs, {{as the answer to}} the decay and squalor of urban centers. Viewing Greenbelt solely in terms of its progressive legacy is limiting, however, unless that legacy is investigated using class, race, and gender analysis. With the planning, design, and administration of the new community in Greenbelt, New Deal planners envisioned a new form of architecture, town-planning and administration that would provide a social and physical environment conducive to the formation of viable, stable, working-class families. These planners assumed that if working-class residents adopted the gender relations that were normative in the middle-class, long term problems of poverty and social disorder would disappear. The built environment of Greenbelt, contemporary photographs, and federal administrative records provide significant evidence to study the relationship between "class rehabilitation" and gender norms. This project offers a new approach to understanding the New Deal housing policies and the construction of a domestic ideal...|$|R
