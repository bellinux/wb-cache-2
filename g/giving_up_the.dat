5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open escape route, and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E

California-based Indian filmmaker Jag Mundhra was keen on remaking Dil Ek Mandir in English and Hindi, effecting some {{marginal}} changes in the film treatment. Mundhra met Sridhar {{to ask for the}} rights to the film's script only to learn that Sridhar had assigned it to a film financier for a paltry sum, for eternity.

5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared {{was an attempt to}} take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to the monks.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{performed}} in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, Mumbai, {{was cut short}} when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage. Narayan pondered <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sarangi and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial.|$|E

He had wins at North Carolina Motor Speedway (Rockingham), Atlanta, Darlington, Martinsville, Talladega, Dover, Michigan, second Daytona race, second Atlanta race, second Dover race, and the second Rockingham race. The remaining seven races contained four Did Not Finishes (DNFs), two-second-place finishes and one third place.

5|$|Orca, {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery, is a {{mercenary}} {{employed by the}} private military company Shoreline. During Uncharted 4: A Thief's End he is a lieutenant {{under the command of}} Nadine Ross. After their client Rafe Adler finds Captain Avery's treasure on-board his booby-trapped pirate ship, Orca draws his gun on Ross after she protests Adler on risking further danger in boarding the ship, betraying her command by siding with treasure hunter in seizing the lucrative treasure. Orca later appears in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, taking command of Shoreline after Ross departs from the company, and has struck a deal with an Indian insurgency force headed by Asav. He purchases the Tusk of Ganesh from Asav in exchanging him a bomb that the insurgent leader plans to detonate in a nearby city to ignite a revolution. Orca later gets attacked by Ross and her associate Chloe Frazer inside his helicopter before it crashes to the ground, severely injuring him. After implying that he sold a bomb to Asav and <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Tusk, he quickly tries to shoot Ross but gets killed in return fire after she is saved by Sam Drake.|$|E

5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As {{no one else could}} see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that she was out of reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
