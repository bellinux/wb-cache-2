With the given <b>investment</b> <b>policy</b> <b>statements</b> (IPS) of the SIAS fund, this study {{will focus on the}} large-cap Canadian equity markets. The methodology of the practice was driven by the study conducted by Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton where the research identified Geometric Mean Dividend Yield, Real Dividend Growth Rate, Expansion in the P/D Ratio, and Change in Real Exchange Rate to determine general U. S. equity market return. The findings from this thesis research had determined three additional factors that can impact on the Canadian equity market return, which included Crude Oil Price Return, Global PMI Return, and US CPI Growth. In addition, similar practices were attempted for the major three sectors of the Canadian equity market, namely energy, material, and financial sectors; and the factors that impact these sectors varies. We have demonstrated an ERP of 3. 57 % for S&P TSX 60 Index from our own model; where we have 1. 66 %, 1. 70 %, 0. 79 % of ERPs for the energy sector, material sector, and financial sector, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{actively}} managed investments generally carry more risk and lower returns than globally diversifi ed, risk-calibrated index portfolios. Despite this fact, governing boards of retirement plans, foundations and endowments frequently fall prey to manager picking consultants and the allure of past winners, hiring the hottest new fund managers only to fi re them later because their past performance doesn’t persist in the subsequent periods. A recent study conducted by Amit Goyal of Emory University and Sunil Wahal of Arizona State University found that manager hiring and fi ring decisions made by consultants and board members of retirement plans, endowments, and foundations was a complete waste of money and the board members precious time. “The Selection and Termination of Investment Management Firms by Plan Sponsors ” reveals the negative impact of manager chasing. The results, as set forth in Figures 5 -A and 5 -B, demonstrate that during the ten-year period from 1994 through 2003, consultants and boards which based their fund manager hiring decisions on consistent above benchmark past performance were largely disappointed with subsequent results. They often then fi red their managers in favor of another recent top performer, only to fi nd that the one they fi red actually outperformed the ones they hired. This cyclical motion undermines objectives set forth in <b>investment</b> <b>policy</b> <b>statements</b> and devastates the opportunity to achieve optimal returns, the kind of returns that are available by simply buying, holding and rebalancing a passively managed portfolio of index funds that keeps costs low and controls risk...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we attempt to expand the limited {{framework}} of single-objective optimisation and broaden Markowitz's market standard, within which the problem of portfolio selection is conventionally addressed. The decision maker's <b>Investment</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Statement</b> (IPS) is formulated through a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model. The model is then solved through the augmented e-constrained (AUGMECON) method, a novel a posteriori Multiobjective Mathematical Programming (MMP) technique. Our purpose for transforming the traditional two-dimension portfolio selection problem into a mixed-integer multiobjective optimisation problem in space is twofold: 1) to incorporate three objective functions in the decision process beyond the mean-variance approach, i. e., an additional measure of return, the portfolio's relative dividend yield, 2) to model even the most complex preferences that the investor may express, regarding specific cardinal constraints.

Strict guidelines were set {{in place by the}} <b>Investment</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Statement</b> and followed accordingly.

Emphasis was placed on historical asset returns as well as the current economic market structure when applying the investment process and asset allocation concepts. The investment process included four major steps: determining investment objectives, developing asset allocation strategies, portfolio construction and implementation, and ongoing portfolio management. Using the steps highlighted in the Portfolio Management Process resulted in a "top down" method for asset and sector selections and a "bottom up” method for individual security selections. Several relative and absolute valuation methods were learned and applied to both the fixed income and equity markets.

This makes plans in higher education, in particular, DC plans, models for consideration by public policy analysts. But plan designs in higher education are not static and unchanging. Colleges {{and universities}} must ensure that their plans are not only effective in providing retirement income security, but that they are cost-effective in doing so. In addition, sponsored plans must be competitive in the labor market.
