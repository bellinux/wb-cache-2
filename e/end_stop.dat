2500|$|Moving mirrors are {{faster than}} moving head fixtures. However moving heads are {{visually}} {{more interesting and}} have a far larger range of movement. The movement from mirror lights tends to be rectilinear, because the center of movement for both axes is usually in the same place, while one axis of a moving head luminaire describes a circle (usually called [...] "pan") and the other (the [...] "tilt") changes {{the diameter of the}} circular movement. In early luminaires a pseudo rotating gobo effect could be achieved by moving the tilt in line with the other axis and then moving the pan from <b>end</b> <b>stop</b> to <b>end</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E

50|$|If {{the wave}} height (the {{difference}} between wave crest and wave trough) {{is larger than}} the stroke length, the translator will reach a standstill at the lower <b>end</b> <b>stop.</b> At the upper <b>end</b> <b>stop</b> the wave flushes over the buoy and at the lower the line slackens. In both of these cases no power is produced (voltage induced) until the translator starts to move again. This happens when the wave is lower than the buoy’s top position in the upper state, and in the lower state when the wave has risen so much that the buoy once again starts to pull the translator upwards. It has been found that most of the energy is transmitted through wave heights of 1.2-2.7 m in the research area.|$|E

40|$|Uncontrolled {{magnetically driven}} dosing pumps cause noise when the {{armature}} reaches the mechanical <b>end</b> <b>stops.</b> The {{reason for this}} is the impulse of the armature, which depends on the armature speed. A speed reduction before reaching the <b>end</b> <b>stops</b> could reduce the noise level. This requires a special modification of the time-dependent armature motion using variable energy supply. In order to control the armature motion independently from various inputs such as supply voltage, outlet pressure and liquid properties, the position has to be known. Sensorless position estimation is used, since it offers the determination of the armature position without modifying the simple pump design. The estimation is based on the evaluation of electrical values. In order to show feasibility of position estimation in dosing pumps considering different control strategies, simulation based preliminary investigations are performed and validated with experimental results. For this purpose, a co-simulation of controller, electrical and mechanical system simulation and magnetic FEM simulation is used...|$|R
