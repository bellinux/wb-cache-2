5000|$|The bodywork, {{designed}} by Peugeot Style Centre, was praised as graceful and imaginative, and has influenced subsequent Peugeot cars. The diesel Diamond {{was quoted as}} capable of a fuel economy of 57 mpg (4.1 L/100 km), a very impressive figure for any car with sporting ambitions. The television show BBC Top <b>Gear,</b> <b>not</b> <b>known</b> for its love of diesels, reviewed the Peugeot RC Diamond in 2002 and presenter Richard Hammond remarked that it was [...] "possibly the first proper diesel sports car." ...|$|R

In 2009, another Times article reiterated that only a few production staff, the show's presenters and other BBC journalists knew the Stig's true identity.|$|R

50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, a {{clogged filter}} in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that {{rises and falls}} in synch with engine RPM. It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon <b>gears</b> <b>not</b> quite meshing correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Each side is {{permitted}} to turn in only 180° increments or half turns. Due to the <b>gears</b> <b>not</b> making a full rotation along with the side it's attached to, it prohibits 90° turns. This {{is the reason why}} all of the algorithms involve either half turns or a full rotation.|$|R

50|$|As {{well as the}} Whatsit, in 1930 Waterman {{produced}} another innovative {{design with}} a low-wing monoplane that could change the dihedral of its wings during flight for shorter takeoffs, increased flight speed, and slower landing speeds according to the designer in its debut at the National Air races in Chicago. In addition to the wing design, he also placed the landing <b>gears</b> <b>not</b> under the fuselage but outwards under the wings.|$|R

5000|$|The {{outermost}} loop, {{the main}} loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback {{of the actual}} load position is presented by a Rotary encoder that produces a binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP). Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by <b>gears</b> (<b>not</b> shown) between the motor and the telescope ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{rotation}} of the planet gears can in turn drive the ring <b>gear</b> (<b>not</b> depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If the ring gear has N teeth, then the ring will rotate by N/N turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the ring gear has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the ring gear. Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|R

5000|$|Nymphs of many fulgoroids produce wax {{from special}} glands on the {{abdominal}} terga {{and other parts}} of the body. These are hydrophobic and help conceal the insects. Adult females of many families also produce wax which may be used to protect eggs. [...] Fulgoroid nymphs also possess a biological gear mechanism at the base of the hind legs, which keeps the legs in synchrony when the insects jump. The <b>gears,</b> <b>not</b> present in the adults, were known for decades before the recent description of their function.|$|R
