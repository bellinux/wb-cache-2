5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible for <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted {{of a number of}} fixed guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as the threat to Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible for <b>developing</b> <b>and</b> manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports. These defences consisted of fixed anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as the threat to Australia increased. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.|$|E
