5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Finally news of {{sightings}} filtered back to France {{and spread}} around Europe and the United States. As {{was reported in}} The New York Times the following day, the Patrie had been observed {{on the morning of}} Sunday, 1December 1907, over Cardigan (Wales). On the afternoon of the same day she made landfall at Ballysallagh, near Holywood, County Down in northern Ireland, where a propeller and bevel <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> were broken off (see photo). With the loss of this weight the Patrie once more ascended and was spotted by a Lloyd's signal station at Torr Head on the Antrim coast. The next sighting came soon after, over islands in St. Patrick's Channel, between Ireland and Scotland. The Patrie continued northwards, where the last sighting was reported by Captain Buchanan of the steamship Olivine at latitude 58°N near the Hebrides, [...] after which she was lost without a trace.|$|E
500|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} locomotive was the high-set Nclass boiler, which was pitched [...] above the frames to accommodate the inside cylinder assembly, potentially exposing the conjugation mechanism to the elements. To prevent corrosion, Maunsell incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the inside cylinder and valve <b>gear</b> <b>assembly,</b> the main visual difference from the Nclass. Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard Nclass chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders. To mitigate this, a wider-diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide-diameter cast chimney. The rest of the construction process followed the 1919 N1 specification, and the final {{three members of the}} order for 15 Nclass locomotives were built as intended. The N1 prototype was completed in December 1922 and attached to a standard Maunsell [...] flat-sided Ashford Nclass tender. It entered service on 24 March 1923 and the boiler pressure was reduced from [...] to [...] for No.822's fuel consumption to be compared with that of the 2-cylinder Nclass during trials.|$|E

2500|$|A spur-gear {{differential}} has two equal-sized spur gears, one {{for each}} half-shaft, with a space between them. Instead of the Bevel gear, {{also known as a}} miter <b>gear,</b> <b>assembly</b> (the [...] "spider") at the centre of the differential, there is a rotating carrier on the same axis as the two shafts. Torque from a [...] or transmission, such as the drive shaft of a car, rotates this carrier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rebuilding}} process {{involved the}} removal of the side water tanks, the rear coal bunker and the trailing axles. [...] In featuring similar components to the U class, the U1 was similar in profile, although a slab-front was incorporated above the front buffer beam to house the third cylinder and associated valve <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> between the frames. Nevertheless, the U1 retained the [...] driving wheels and general cab layout of the U class, and the Maunsell [...] tender previously used on the N class locomotives, with No. A890 entering revenue-earning service in June 1928.|$|E
2500|$|The valve <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> {{originally}} designed by Holcroft {{for use on}} the N1 class regulated {{the timing of the}} valve events that admitted steam into the cylinder, increasing efficiency whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effects of hammerblow on the track. Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight. This was achieved by using the combination lever assembly that controlled the fore and aft movement of the valve spindle, which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam through the ports.|$|E

2500|$|When such a hub is pedaled forwards, the {{sprocket}} {{drives a}} screw which forces a clutch to move along the axle, driving the hub shell or <b>gear</b> <b>assembly.</b> [...] When pedaling is reversed, the screw drives the clutch {{in the opposite}} direction, forcing it either between two brake shoes and pressing them against the brake mantle (which is a steel liner within the hub shell), or into a split collar and expanding it against the mantle. [...] The braking surface is often steel, and the braking element brass or phosphor-bronze, as in the Birmingham-made Perry Coaster Hub. [...] Crude coaster brakes also exist, usually on children's bicycles, where a serrated steel brake cone grips {{the inside of the}} hub shell directly, with no separate brake pads or mantle. [...] These offer a less progressive action {{and are more likely to}} lock the rear wheel unintentionally.|$|E
50|$|In first gear, {{power flow}} {{was through the}} forward {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> (either 1.45:1 or 1.55:1 reduction, depending on the model), then the fluid coupling, followed by the rear <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> (2.63:1 reduction) and through the reverse <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> (normally locked) to the output shaft. That is, the input torus of the fluid coupling ran at a lower speed than the engine, due to {{the reduction of the}} forward <b>gear</b> <b>assembly.</b> This produced an exceptionally smooth startup because of the relatively large amount of slippage initially produced in the fluid coupling. This slippage quickly diminished as engine RPM increased.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{shifting}} to third, the forward <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> {{went back into}} reduction and the rear <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> locked. Due to {{the manner in which}} the rear <b>gear</b> <b>assembly</b> was arranged, the coupling went from handling 100 percent of the engine torque to about 40 percent, with the balance being handled solely by the gear train. This greatly reduced slippage, which fact was audible by the substantial reduction that occurred in engine RPM when the shift occurred.|$|E
