Base on the generalized uncertainty principle, we investigate {{the influence of}} quantum gravity and the result {{tell us that the}} quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>correction</b> accelerates the evaporation of black hole. Using corrected Dirac equation in curved spacetime and Hamilton-Jacobi method, we address the tunnelling of fermions in a 4 -dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime. After solving the equation of motion of the spin 1 / 2 field, we obtain the corrected Hawking temperature. It turns out that the correction depends not only on the mass of black hole but aslo on the mass of emitted fermions. In our calculation, the quantum <b>gravity</b> <b>correction</b> accelerates the increasing of Hawking temperature during the radiation explicitly.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} mean intraindividual {{biological}} variation in urinary concentrations of cadmium and retinol binding protein (RBP) in untimed, random urine samples {{and the influence}} of creatinine or specific <b>gravity</b> <b>correction</b> on reducing this variation. The relation between biological variation and analytical variation in defining uncertainty in a single measurement and significant differences between successive measurements was explored.

Standard statistical tools used in clinical laboratory medicine were applied to define intraindividual biological and analytical variation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Both creatinine and specific <b>gravity</b> <b>correction</b> of urinary cadmium measurements in random urine samples seem to reduce the intraindividual variability compared with uncorrected values. With a standard definition, acceptable long term analytical precision for measurements of cadmium and RBP combined with creatinine analyses should be 54 % and > 110 % respectively.

Although the classical actions are very different, quantum corrections to the equation of state are remarkably similar.
