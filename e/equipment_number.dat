The fate of Werknummer 290 060 is unknown. Following testing, He 219 A-2 Werknummer 290 202 was then moved to Orchard Place Airport in Park Ridge, Illinois in 1946. It was stored in a vacant aircraft factory and then transferred to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum on 3 January 1949. Finally, the He 219 was crated and shipped to the Smithsonian's Silver Hill, Maryland storage facility in early 1955.|$|E
50|$|A {{problem was}} {{discovered}} very {{late in the}} development of the TXE4 in that an <b>equipment</b> <b>number</b> could be threaded with the wrong directory number by mistake on the cyclic stores. Even worse it could be the directory number of another <b>equipment</b> <b>number</b> leading to multiple directory numbers. This would cause Number Unobtainable (NU) tone when the incorrectly threaded number was dialled and the double threading number received incorrect calls. The exchange had no way of detecting this but the programming of one of the MCUs allowed a separate programme to run to detect this problem and print out the locations of the duplicates. This had to be done on a regular basis. Eventually, after many more diagnostic routines had been added, this became known as Tester 299A, even though it was only software.|$|E

The car was purchased by the Alaska Railroad in 1923 from the Great Northern Railroad, and was used in its service until 1945. At the urging of the Fairbanks chapter ("igloo") of the Pioneers of Alaska, the car was restored in 1959-60 and given to the city of Fairbanks. It was placed in Alaskaland in 1967, created to mark the centennial of the Alaska Purchase. It was used for some years as the park's visitor center.|$|E

50|$|Subscriber {{information}} was programmed into the exchange in racks called cyclic stores which used PTFE wire threaded through magnetic cores known as 'Dimond ring' (see TXE2 section for more information). The information stored was the Class of Service (COS) i.e. PBX, CCB (payphone) or single line, {{followed by the}} directory number. The subscribers derived an <b>equipment</b> <b>number</b> from the position on the cyclic store rack. This was a six-digit number and {{referred to as the}} MUCKBL, which describes to the exchange where this is. In some parts of the exchange equipment was in the format of BUMCLK and this was used by engineers as a pseudo swear word. When a subscriber lifted their handset it sent a pulse down this wire, which was picked up by a 156 ms scanner, which initiated a path to be set up through the reed relays so the subscriber could be connected to a Register. This Register then returned dialling tone to the subscriber and dialling could commence.|$|E
50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling <b>equipment</b> <b>number</b> in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the transverter connector (TVC) to seize a transverter (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} flat spring relays that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of ferrite ring cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold cathode tube amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the transverter which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the tandem office.|$|E
50|$|A novel but {{subsequently}} disastrous feature {{designed by}} Bell Antwerp {{was used to}} hold the subscriber’s class of service information i.e. PBX, shared service, incoming calls barred (ICB), temporary out of service (TOS) etc. This was a capacitor store, and it held information on a thin plastic strip, into which could be inserted up to 10 little copper squares which had a capacitance of 10 pico farad. The thin plastic strips were then inserted into the Data Store rack, one at the position representing the directory number and another at the position representing the <b>equipment</b> <b>number.</b> This {{can be seen in}} the photograph together with some plastic strips hanging by wire. Hanging the strips by wire was a common practice for subscribers who were constantly changing their Class of Service, i.e. being made TOS. This information was then pulsed by the STC common control translator and appropriate action taken. STC had enormous trouble getting it to work, which caused a delay to the opening of the exchange. In the end the problem turned out to be cable interference requiring substantial re-cabling at the rear of the rack. This system was not used again and was replaced by a threaded-core store called Dimond Rings in TXE3, TXE4 and TXE2, which were extremely reliable.|$|E

5000|$|Five Me 163s were {{originally}} {{brought to the}} United States in 1945, receiving the Foreign Equipment numbers FE-495 and FE-500 to 503. An Me 163 B-1a, Werknummer (serial number) 191301, arrived at Freeman Field, Indiana, during mid-1945, and received the foreign <b>equipment</b> <b>number</b> FE-500. On 12 April 1946, it was flown aboard a cargo aircraft to the U.S. Army Air Forces facility at Muroc dry lake in California for flight testing. Testing began on 3 May 1946 {{in the presence of}} Dr. Alexander Lippisch and involved towing the unfueled Komet behind a Boeing B-29 Superfortress to an altitude of 9000 - 10500 m before it was released for a glide back to earth under the control of test pilot Major Gus Lundquist. Powered tests were planned, but not carried out after delamination of the aircraft's wooden wings was discovered. It was then stored at Norton AFB, California until 1954, when it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. The aircraft remained on display in an unrestored condition at the museum's Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland, until 1996, when it was lent to the Mighty Eighth Air Force Museum in Pooler, Georgia for restoration and display but has since been returned to the Smithsonian and as of 2011 is on display unrestored at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington D.C..|$|E

To address this situation, a user-friendly computer program was developed {{which can be used}} to design a composting operation based on current scientific and regulatory recommendations. The program uses critical user-inputs such as types of feedstocks, types of <b>equipment,</b> <b>number</b> of workers and location of the facility, to develop a preliminary design of the composting process and facility, and an estimate of capital and operating costs.

30|$|In mining literature, {{most of the}} {{research}} focused on optimizing mining subsystems individually. In such an approach, the cost can convey to the subsequent subsystems. In other words, while the cost of one subsystem is minimized, the cost of following subsystems may increase. In fact, focusing on an individual subsystem may cause missing the relationship between the subsystems. This paper proposes a novel system-wide approach to optimize the mining cost by considering the relationship among interrelated subsystems. Since the costs of activities forming mining cycle are expressed regarding fragmentation size to be obtained and blast-hole diameter, these two parameters are used as common ground in the calculations. Once the optimum fragmentation size is obtained, the other sections of a specific mining subsystem (such as the size of the mining <b>equipment,</b> <b>number</b> of trucks, flow rate, etc.) can be optimized individually. Moreover, the approach includes a sensitivity analysis to quantify the relative effect of the cost components.|$|E
