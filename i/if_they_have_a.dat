5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have perforations in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stalk.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> superior intellect.|$|E

In a first study, 86 subjects could assess their performance after a motor test. The results showed that ego-oriented subjects chose normative information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> high perceived ability, and rejected information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> low one; task-oriented subjects chose objective information regardless of their perceived ability. In a second study, 108 subjects could use information during a training period. Data confirmed the prior results for ego-oriented subjects, and showed that task-oriented subjects preferred task information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> low perceived ability and objective information <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> high one...|$|R

5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms {{are associated with}} potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH {{were more likely to}} bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> proper license.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{far more}} massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways. In {{the core of}} the star, {{hydrogen}} is fused into helium, releasing thermal energy that heats the sun's core and provides outward pressure that supports the sun's layers against collapse in a process known as stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium. The helium produced in the core accumulates there since temperatures in the core are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, fusion starts to slow down, and gravity causes the core to contract. This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion, which accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with fewer than eight solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse, and the star gradually cools to become a white dwarf. White dwarf stars, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> near companion, may then become Type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E
