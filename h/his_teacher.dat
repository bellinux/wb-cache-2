5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring <b>his</b> <b>teacher,</b> which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring <b>his</b> <b>teacher</b> as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E

The younger Symeon was extremely zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to {{such an extent that}} the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave after only a few months.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that he was {{becoming}} increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and orality in Greece concerned the nature of the historical Socrates, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of Xenophon and Aristophanes as well as Plato himself, was that Plato's presentation of <b>his</b> <b>teacher</b> was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with John Burnet, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the theory of forms originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the Athens of his youth, when Socrates was <b>his</b> <b>teacher.</b> Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.|$|E
