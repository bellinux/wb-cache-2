40|$|A {{hybrid of}} a {{microfabricated}} planar preconcentrator and a four element chemiresistor array chip has been fabricated {{and the performance}} as a chemical sensor system has been demonstrated. The close proximity of the chemiresistor sensor to the preconcentrator absorbent layer allows for fast transfer of the preconcentrated molecules during the heating and resorption step. The hybrid {{can be used in}} a conventional flow sampling system for detection of low concentrations of analyte molecules or in a pumpless/valveless mode with a <b>grooved</b> <b>lid</b> to confine the desorption plume from the preconcentrator during heating...|$|E
5000|$|The tombs are {{of various}} forms, partly {{chambers}} with frescoes on the walls, partly cubical blocks of peperino, hollowed out, with <b>grooved</b> <b>lids.</b> The objects found within them consist mainly of vases of bronze (many of them without feet, and with incised designs of Etruscan style) and of clay, some of Greek, some of local manufacture, and of paintings. On {{the east of}} the town, in the Patturelli property, a temple has been discovered with Oscan votive inscriptions originally thought to be Oscan, now recognized as Etruscan, some of them inscribed upon terracotta tablets, the most famous of which is the Tabula Capuana, conserved in Berlin, still, after more than a century of searching, the second-longest Etruscan text. Other brief inscriptions are on cippi. A group of 150 tuff statuettes represent a matron holding one or more children in her lap: three bore Latin inscriptions of the early Imperial period.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1964 model year, the GT {{saw some}} {{extensive}} design changes. Tooling money was finally appropriated {{to eliminate the}} <b>grooved</b> trunk <b>lid</b> that had required the 1962-63 Hawks' faux rear [...] "grille." [...] The new, smooth trunklid bore a script [...] "Studebaker Hawk" [...] nameplate. Another grille change was made, this time with two new features: A Hawk emblem was centered in the grille, and a circle-S hood ornament (shared with the regular '64 Studebaker passenger cars) graced {{the top of the}} grille shell.|$|R
50|$|Typically, half-fare tickets (e.g. for children, dogs, and bicycles) {{would be}} created by cutting the ticket in half vertically, return tickets by having a {{diagonal}} cut across the ticket, having the value of half the adult fare. The remaining part was placed in <b>groove</b> in the <b>lid</b> of the ticket rack above its tube. It could then be used as another child ticket, or counted as a credit.|$|R
50|$|On January 5, 1875, Charles de Quillfeldt of New York City {{invented a}} wire-bail closure {{known as the}} Lightning closure. Within a short time he sold the patent rights to several individuals, {{including}} Henry Putnam and Karl Hutter. The stopper or lid was typically made from metal, porcelain, or ceramic, while a rubber gasket was used to seal the container. Putnam modified de Quillfeldt's design so that the lid was secured by centering the wire bail between two raised dots or in a <b>groove</b> along the <b>lid's</b> center. Putnam's closure was patented 1882 (U.S. Patent #256,857).|$|R
5000|$|In 1852, Edward Robinson noted here: [...] "We {{came upon}} an ancient {{sarcophagus}} {{at the foot}} of the hill, and saw others on the way up. On the top near the village are two very large ones. One of the lids measured 7 1/2 feet long by 2 feet broad, with nearly the same thickness. In a field below our tent, about midway of the hill-side, were others of an unusual character. In a large isolated rock were excavated no less than three sarcophagi, side by side and then the exterior of the rock was hewn away, and the corners rounded oft. Around each sarcophagus a ledge was left for a corresponding <b>groove</b> in the <b>lid.</b> The whole is a striking monument of antiquity." ...|$|R
5000|$|They further noted: [...] "This is evidently {{an ancient}} site the rock {{to the south}} of the village is cut into cisterns tombs with side and end on kokim loculi; sarcophagi or tombs covered with flat lid on the surface; birkets for holding rainwater; olive-presses and wine-presses in {{considerable}} numbers, all cutin the rock. There is no ancient masonry in the village, except at the mouth of an enormous cistern, where the round arches that support the wheel for drawing up the water may be ancient. A little down the hill on the south-east there are some sarcophagi cut out of the rock on pedestals steps lead up on the west side to one of them there are <b>grooves</b> for the <b>lids</b> to fit into, but these are in all cases wanting they had probably a ridge and knobs at the four corners, as frequently observed elsewhere." ...|$|R
