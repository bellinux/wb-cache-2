500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent Republican {{politicians}} {{reacted to}} the speech as well. Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have to just say, I probably would too." [...] Huckabee suggested that he was [...] "probably the only conservative in America who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> like this." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'If--' began Harold, {{clenching}} his fists--and Alfred raised himself {{upon his}} bed with flashing eyes to watch, {{as the boy}} had moved nearer, and looked {{for a moment as}} if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grin, or <b>say</b> <b>something</b> impudent; but the quiet childish form stepping on so simply and steadily seemed to disarm him, and he shrunk back, left her to trip across the road unmolested, and stood leaning over the rail of the bridge, gazing after her as she crossed the hay-field.|$|R

60|$|He held it a moment, {{as if he}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more. But he {{only looked}} at her; then he took his departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know as {{much about}} her after all that {{as if we had}} lived in two {{different}} hemispheres and couldn't speak a word of each other's language. There isn't a thought or a feeling in common between us. I ask after her husband and her children, and then tell her it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rain. She <b>says</b> <b>something</b> about the old General's health, and then there is an end of everything between us. When next we meet we do it all over again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Miers {{met with}} the Senate Judiciary Committee after her {{nomination}} and in those meetings she was ill-prepared and uninformed on the law. Senator Tom Coburn told her privately that she [...] "flunked" [...] and [...] " [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> next time." [...] Miers had difficulty expressing her views and explaining basic constitutional law concepts. Miers had no experience in constitutional law {{and did not have}} extensive litigation experience; at her Texas law firm, she had been more of a manager. In addition, Miers had rarely handled appeals and did not understand the complicated constitutional questions senators asked of her. To White House lawyers, Miers was [...] "less an attorney than a law firm manager and bar association president." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it now?" [...] she remarked quickly, {{colouring}} as she met his gaze. [...] "Do stop a minute, Clym, and let {{me speak}} first, for oddly enough, I have been wanting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about law {{being the}} worst {{wilderness}} of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Floyd Allen's defense attorney, David Winton Bolen, [...] "Floyd {{hesitated a}} moment, {{and then he}} arose...He {{looked to me like}} a man who was about <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}},</b> and had hardly made up his mind what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but as he got straight, he moved off to my left, I would say five or six feet, and he seemed to gain his speech, and he said something like this, 'I just tell you, I ain't a'going.'" [...] At this point, shots broke out in the courtroom.|$|R

"I--I--" [...] Rachel was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> of her {{change of}} opinion {{with regard to}} {{military}} society, but a sudden consciousness set her cheeks in a flame and checked her tongue; while Bessie Keith, with ease and readiness, filled up the blank.|$|E
