The spirit of liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements <b>is</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{folklore}} {{features a}} rich variety of ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural creatures. According to traditional beliefs a ghost <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> {{form of a}} person who has died. Ghosts are typically malevolent and will cause harm to the living if provoked. Many Chinese folk beliefs about ghosts have been adopted into the mythologies and folklore of neighboring cultures, notably Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. Beliefs about ghosts are closely associated with Chinese ancestor worship, where much have been incorporated into Taoism. Later beliefs were influenced by Buddhism and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs about the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since the Father is the God of the Old Testament. The Father is the origin of all things {{and this is the}} basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what the Father is). In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of the uncreated Father (God).|$|E

500|$|Zwingli {{approached}} the eucharist {{in a similar}} manner to baptism. During the first Zurich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was [...] "a memorial of the sacrifice". Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the [...] "signifies" [...] interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against transubstantiation as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> who gives life, the flesh is of no avail". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.|$|E

We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, {{a certain amount of}} thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..."

500|$|Marvel {{trusted the}} {{producers}} of S.H.I.E.L.D. with creating and using Ghost Rider how they wanted to, but did ask them [...] "to be true to what it is" [...] in the comics. They looked to do this by taking the original elements from the comic, but putting their own spin on them. This included Reyes' uncle Eli, who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> possessing Reyes in the comic, appearing as an external villain. Reyes' is instead possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance, which is passed to him by Blaze; in the comics, multiple Ghost Riders exist at once, but for the series this was changed so the power can only be used by one at a time, and they {{pass it on to}} the next Ghost Rider. Beyond briefly depicting Blaze doing this, and including a poster of the Quentin Carnival in the background of a scene to hint at the character's comic book history, the producers did not intend to feature or explore that character further.|$|E

[...] Steevens, under the name [...] "Philo Johnson" [...] claimed in the European Magazine: [...] "the great solid principle that secures its condemnation, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of malevolence to the dead, which breathes all through it. Sir John Hawkins, with all the humanity and very little of the dexterity of a Clare-Market butcher, has raised his blunt axe to deface the image of his friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Zwingli {{credited}} the Dutch humanist, Cornelius Henrici Hoen (Honius), {{for first}} suggesting the [...] "is" [...] {{in the institution}} words [...] "This is my body" [...] meant [...] "signifies". Hoen {{sent a letter to}} Zwingli in 1524 with this interpretation along with biblical examples to support it. It is impossible to say how the letter impacted Zwingli's theology although Zwingli claimed that he already held the symbolic view when he read the letter. He first mentioned the [...] "signifies" [...] interpretation in a letter to Matthäus Alber, an associate of Luther. Zwingli denies transubstantiation using John 6:63, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> who gives life, the flesh is of no avail", as support. He commended Andreas Karlstadt's understanding of the significance of faith, but rejected Karlstadt's view that the word [...] "this" [...] refers to Christ's body rather than the bread. Using other biblical passages and patristic sources, he defended the [...] "signifies" [...] interpretation. In The Eucharist (1525), following the introduction of his communion liturgy, he laid out the details of his theology where he argues against the view that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ and that they are eaten bodily.|$|E
