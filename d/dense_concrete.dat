30|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature review}} {{was conducted in}} this study on the distinctive features of UHPC. The unique properties of UHPC have several advantages over normal-strength concrete (NSC) owing to its material ingredients and composition. The key factor in producing UHPC {{is to improve the}} micro and macro properties of its mixture constituents to ensure mechanical homogeneity and denser particle packing. UHPC yields high compressive strength (i.e. > 150  MPa (22  ksi)) due to its improved internal micro- and macro-structure, leading to <b>denser</b> <b>concrete.</b> The application of thermal curing further densifies UHPC, which results in higher compressive strength properties. The typical heat treatment applied for UHPC is 90 – 400  °C (194 – 752  °F) for 2 – 6  days. The specimen size significantly affects the measured compressive strength of UHPC. Smaller size specimens can be used if the test machine capacity is limited. Furthermore, it was observed that the loading rate did not significantly affect the measured compressive strength of UHPC. The compressive stress–strain response of UHPC shows a linear elastic behavior up to 80 – 90  % of the maximum stress value.|$|R

40|$|Owing to the {{shortage}} of space for land reclamation in Hong Kong, {{it is difficult to}} dispose of tons of masonry waste generated daily from construction activities. Adoption of recycled aggregate from concrete waste thus becomes a burning issue. The Hong Kong SAR Government has set up a recycling plant in Tuen Mun Area 38 aiming at turning concrete waste into recycled aggregate with a practice note and specifications issued for controlling the quality of recycled aggregate. However, the use of recycled aggregate concrete to high grade applications is rarely reported because of its poorer compressive strength and high variability in mechanical behavior. This paper proposes a new approach in mixing concrete, namely "two-stage mixing approach (TSMA) ", intended to improve the compressive strength for recycled aggregate concrete and hence lower its strength variability. Based upon experimental works, improvements in strength to recycled aggregate concrete were achieved. The effect can be attributable to the porous nature of the recycled aggregate and hence the pre-mix process can fill up some pores and cracks, resulting in a <b>denser</b> <b>concrete,</b> an improved interfacial zone around recycled aggregate and thus a higher strength when compared with the traditional mixing approach.

Nineteen bridges that were resurfaced with either low slump <b>dense</b> <b>concrete</b> (LSDC) or latex-modified concrete were analyzed for chloride content, electrical corrosion potential, delaminations or debonding, and deck surface condition. The resurfacing ages of these bridges range from 5 to 13 years. None of the bridges showed {{any evidence of}} surface distress and the chloride penetration into the resurfacing concrete is relatively low. There are delaminations in the original decks below the resurfacing on the majority of bridges examined.

The active corrosion of the reinforcing steel is predominately in the gutter line on the majority of bridges evaluated. Recommendations for future deck repairs include removal of concrete to the top layer of reinforcing steel in areas where an electrical corrosion potential of - 0. 35 V or more is detected, providing more positive methods of locating delaminated concrete, and treating the curb and gutter line to reduce the potential damage from salt water...|$|E
