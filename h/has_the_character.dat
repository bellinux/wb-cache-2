25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of a contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} of the issues {{surrounding}} Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on a few specific occasions. Plato’s Apology <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Socrates describe one such instance. He says that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon.|$|E

500|$|Most of the game's {{missions}} {{take place}} in third-person shooting format, combined {{with the use of}} a cover system. When a character is behind a low object like a crate, or at the edge of a corner or doorframe, they can press a button to use the object or edge as cover. Another button will allow the character to peer around and enter a targeting mode, while releasing the button will quickly return them to cover. There is also a stealth mode which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> stoop, walk silently (unless running), duck behind any low obstacles they can hide behind and be less detectable by sound. A character can sneak up behind an enemy using stealth mode and perform a silent [...] "stealth takedown" [...] by breaking his neck.|$|E

Nesbit's children's books feature the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures coming to life, including The Enchanted Castle (1907). The 1932 novel Have His Carcase, by Dorothy L. Sayers, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> Lord Peter Wimsey mention the [...] "antediluvian monsters" [...] of the Crystal Palace. Ann Coates's 1970 children's book Dinosaurs Don't Die, illustrated by John Vernon Lord, tells the story of a young boy who lives near Crystal Palace Park and discovers that Hawkins' models come to life; he befriends one of the Iguanodon and names it 'Rock' and they visit the Natural History Museum.|$|E
500|$|At certain {{locations}} in the game, characters can engage in cooking various recipes: cooking them between battles restores health points. If the recipe is cooked enough times, a character masters it. Upon mastery, a character is granted experience points each time the meal is prepared. Characters are also given [...] "rations", helpings of restorative food, at selected locations across the game world. While initial rations are fairly small, a special [...] "meal ticket" [...] is made available later in the game, which provides larger rations. There are multiple difficulty levels. Mini-games are also available to play, with three types in the game. The first <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> Veigue on a raft navigating a river, with the goal being to avoid dangerous obstacles. The second is a tarot game with the character Hilda, where the player answers questions given by Hilda and has their fortune told. In the third, the player becomes a waiter at an inn, with the goal being to provide good service to the customers: poor service results in the player being dismissed, while good service earns a reward.|$|E
