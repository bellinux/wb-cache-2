It was discovered in petunia as a post-transcriptional gene silencing measure. It is the resultant product when a long <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> of 20 -25 nucleotides length was processed in the cells by the enzyme DICER. The newly synthesized siRNA assemble into endoribonuclease-containing complexes known as RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), unwinding in the process. The activated RISC then binds to the complementary RNA molecules by base pairing interactions between the siRNA strand and the mRNA, which is then cleaved. This mechanism is known as RNA interference or RNAi.|$|E

The results indicate that the parental <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> is conserved as the original duplex molecule within a subviral particle throughout the viral replicative cycle.

40|$|Repeat {{sequences}} {{that are}} expanded in copy number {{are the basis}} for ~ 20 dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s Disease. Despite some of the responsible genes being identified as long as 20 years ago, the identity {{and nature of the}} disease-causing pathogenic pathway remains a gap in knowledge for these diseases. This understanding is essential for rational approaches to delay onset, slow progression or ultimately effect cure. We have previously hypothesized that an RNA-based pathogenic pathway has a causal role in the dominantly inherited unstable expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases. In support of this hypothesis we, and others, have characterized rCAG. rCUG 100 repeat <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> (dsRNA) as a previously unidentified agent capable of causing pathogenesis in a Drosophila model of neurodegenerative disease. Dicer, Toll and autophagy pathways have distinct roles in this Drosophila dsRNA pathology. Dicer-dependence is accompanied by cleavage of rCAG. rCUG 100 repeat <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> down to r(CAG) 7 21 -mers. Among the ‘molecular hallmarks’ of this pathway that have been identified in Drosophila, some [i. e. r(CAG) 7 and elevated TNF] correlate with observations in affected people (e. g. HD, ALS) or in related animal models [i. e. autophagy]. The Toll pathway is activated in the presence of repeat-containing double-stranded RNA and toxicity is also dependent on this pathway. How might the endogenously expressed dsRNA mediate Toll-dependent toxicity in neuronal cells? Endogenous RNAs are normally shielded from Toll pathway activation as part of the mechanism to distinguish ‘self’ from ‘non-self’ RNAs. This typically involves post-transcriptional modification of the RNA. Therefore, it is likely that rCAG. rCUG 100 repeat <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> has a characteristic property that interferes with or evades this normal mechanism of shielding. We predict that repeat expansion leads to an alteration in RNA structure and/or form that perturbs RNA mo...|$|E

To further examine the role of ApC/EBP as a molecular switch of a stable form of long-term memory, we cloned the full-length coding regions of two alternatively spliced forms, the short and long form of ApC/EBP. Overexpression of each isoform by DNA microinjection resulted in a l 6 -fold increase in {{the expression of the}} coinjected luciferase reporter gene driven by an ERE promoter. In addition, when we overexpressed ApC/EBP in Aplysia sensory neurons, we found that the application of a single pulse of 5 -HT that normally induced only short-term facilitation now induced long-term facilitation. Conversely, when we attempted to block the synthesis of native ApC/EBP by microinjecting <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> or antisense RNA, we blocked long-term facilitation in a sequence-specific manner. These data support the idea that ApC/EBP is both necessary and sufficient to consolidate short-term memory into long-term memory. Furthermore, our results suggest that this <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> interference provides a powerful tool {{in the study of the}} genes functioning in learning and memory in Aplysia by specifically inhibiting both the constitutive and induced expression of the genes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> induces a post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} process, termed RNAi, in diverse organisms. It is shown here that transcriptional {{gene silencing}} accompanied by de novo methylation of a target promoter in plants can be triggered by a <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> containing promoter sequences. Similar to the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> involved in RNAi, this promoter <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> which is synthesized in the nucleus, is partially cleaved into small RNAs ∼ 23 nucleotides in length. Both transcriptional and {{post-transcriptional gene silencing}} can thus be initiated by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> that enter the same degradation pathway.

The discovery that this cellular mechanism is also highly conserved though somewhat impaired in mammals has stimulated debate about the evolution of antiviral systems.

In addition, we emphasize the opportunities presented by RNA silencing and the deeper understanding of vertebrate antiviral systems that is needed...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new vector, named pDECAP, to express long <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> (ds-RNA) from an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter. Because the transcripts from pDECAP lack both the 5 ′-cap structure and the 3 ′-poly(A) tail that facilitate ds-RNA export to the cytoplasm, long ds-RNA from pDECAP does not induce the interferon response. Transgenic mice embryos expressing long ds-RNA for the transcriptional corepressor Ski from this vector exhibited phenotypes that were remarkably {{similar to those of}} Ski-deficient embryos, including defects of neural tube closure and eye formation.

40|$|Inhibition {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> {{is caused by}} the inactivation of IF- 3, an initiation factor required for the recycling of ribosomes and for their binding to messenger RNA. The evidence for this is that (i) the inhibition can be overcome by addition of exogenous If- 3; (ii) <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> inactivates stoichiometric amounts of IF- 3; (iii) <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> forms a complex with IF- 3; and (iv) double-stranded DNA, which lacks inhibitory activity, also binds to IF- 3, but with a much lower affinity than <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA.</b> It is concluded that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> inhibits cellular protein synthesis by tightly complexing with IF- 3.

40|$|In plants RNA {{silencing}} is a host {{defense mechanism}} against viral infection, in which <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> is processed into 21 - 24 -nt short interfering RNA (siRNA). Silencing spreads from cell to cell and systemically through a sequence-specific signal {{to limit the}} propagation of the virus. To counteract this defense mechanism, viruses encode suppressors of silencing. The P 1 protein encoded by the rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) displays suppression activity with variable efficiency, according to the isolates that they originated from. Here, we show that P 1 proteins from two RYMV isolates displaying contrasting suppression strength reduced local silencing induced by single-strand and <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. This suppression {{was associated with a}} slight and a severe reduction in 21 - and 24 -nt siRNA accumulation, respectively. Unexpectedly, cell-to-cell movement and systemic propagation of silencing were enhanced in P 1 -expressing Nicotiana plants. When transgenically expressed in rice, P 1 proteins induced specific deregulation of DCL 4 -dependent endogenous siRNA pathways, whereas the other endogenous pathways were not affected. As DCL 4 -dependent pathways {{play a key role in}} rice development, the expression of P 1 viral proteins was associated with the same severe developmental defects in spikelets as in dcl 4 mutants. Overall, our results demonstrate that a single viral protein displays multiple effects on both endogenous and exogenous silencing, not only in a suppressive but also in an enhancive manner. This suggests that P 1 proteins play a key role in maintaining a subtle equilibrium between defense and counter-defense mechanisms, to insure efficient virus multiplication and the preservation of host integrity...|$|E

40|$|Virus {{infection}} in plants {{is limited by}} RNA silencing. In turn, viruses can counter RNA silencing with silencing suppressors. Viral suppressors of RNA silencing {{have been shown to}} play a role in symptom development in plants.

We study the effect of the suppressors on viral accumulation within the cell as well as its spread on a tissue with mathematical and computational models. We find that suppressors which target Argonaute are very effective in a single cell, but that targeting dsRNA or siRNA is much more effective at the tissue level. Although targeting Argonaute can be beneficial for viral spread, it can also cause hindrance in some cases owing to raised levels of siRNAs that can spread to other cells...|$|E

We conclude that (i) there are at least four times as many piRNAs in mouse testes than currently known; (ii) piRNAs, which originate from long precursor transcripts, are generated by quasi-random enzymatic processing that is guided by a weak sequence signature at the piRNA 5 ′ends resulting in a large number of distinct sequences; and (iii) many of the piRNA clusters contain inverted repeats segments capable of forming <b>double-strand</b> <b>RNA</b> fold-back segments that may initiate piRNA processing analogous to transposon silencing...|$|E
