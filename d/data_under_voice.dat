50|$|Some trunked systems queue calls if a user's {{attempt to}} {{transmit}} gets a busy signal. In other words, if someone presses their push-to-talk button and all trunked radio system channels are busy, some systems will wait-list {{users in the}} same order as their busy signals occur. When a channel becomes available, the system notifies the user. There is disagreement about MultiNet's ability to queue calls when all channels are busy. Usually, the control channel is the path allowing wait-listed users to get in line. One publication says MultiNet communicates using low baud rate <b>data</b> multiplexed <b>under</b> <b>voice</b> if all channels are busy. One report says MultiNet users on a live system who got a busy had to either hold their push-to-talk button down continually until the system assigned them a channel or periodically check for an available channel by repeatedly pressing the push-to-talk.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} order to compare the results of subjective and objective speaker recognition <b>under</b> <b>voice</b> disguise conditions. The experimental material consisted of the key sentence “To jest akustyka ” (Eng. “This is acoustics”) spoken several times by Polish male speakers in a natural mode and <b>under</b> <b>voice</b> disguise conditions. In the subjective method the utterances were grouped in pairs and presented to the listeners whose task {{was to make a}} decision whether a given pair of speech samples was produced by one speaker or by two different speakers. In the objective method two parametrical representations of speech (LPC coefficients and Km reflection coefficients) were utilized and a computer program for auto-matic speaker verification was applied. For normal speech both methods exhibited a very good effectiveness of speaker recognition and the results for the subjective method were a bit lower (98. 9 % in comparison to 99. 4 % for the objective method). <b>Under</b> <b>voice</b> disguise conditions, however, the mean results for the subjective method (92. 3 %) were substantially better than for the objective one (77. 2 %) ...|$|R
