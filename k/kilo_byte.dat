There {{is no way}} to avoid this {{increasing}} rate of data till business still running. Because of this issue, database tuning be critical part of a information system. Tuning a database in a cost-effective manner is a growing challenge. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of information technology needs to be significantly reduced by minimizing people costs. In fact, mistakes in operations and administration of information systems are the single most reasons for system outage and unacceptable performance [3]. One way of addressing the challenge of total cost of ownership is by making information systems more self-managing. A particularly difficult piece of the ambitious vision of making database systems self-managing is the automation of database performance tuning. In this paper, we will explain the progress made thus far on this important problem. Specifically, we will propose the architecture and Algorithm for this problem...|$|E

30|$|From Table  3, {{the results}} are analyzed. If Brain disease cover images such as Vascular (Multi-Infarct) Dementia, HIV-Associated Dementia, Brain Huntington’s Disease, and Corticobasal Degeneration are of 262 {{kilobytes}} size and secret data size is 256 bytes, then PSNR and MSE value {{will be in the}} range from 73.56 to 75.46  dB and 0.0049 to 0.0022, respectively, and if data size increases to 1024 bytes, then PSNR and MSE value will be in the range from 70.37 to 71.57  dB and 0.0054 to 0.0041, respectively. If Brain disease cover images’ size increases to 1048 kilobytes and secret data size is 256 bytes, then PSNR and MSE value will be in the range from 82.18 to 83.46  dB and 0.0004 to 0.0003, respectively, and if secret Brain medical data size increases to 1024 bytes, then PSNR and MSE value will be in the range from 77.29 to 78.69 and 0.0011 to 0.0010, respectively. In Vascular (Multi-Infarct) Dementia Brain image, maximum embedding capacity is 89.32 and 387.20 <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes</b> which are 34 and 36  %, respectively, of the Brain image size. In HIV-Associated Dementia Brain image, it is 86.67 and 383.49 <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes,</b> which is 33 and 37  %, respectively, of the Brain image size. In Brain Huntington’s Disease image, it is 84.49 and 379.14 <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes,</b> which is 32 and 36  %, respectively, of the Brain image size. In Corticobasal Degeneration image, it is 85.81 and 380.39 <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes,</b> which is 33 and 36  %, respectively, of the Brain image size. So by result analysis it can be noticed that by increasing the Brain disease cover image size and decreasing the secret brain medical data size, PSNR value will be increased up to 83.46  dB and MSE value will be decreased up to 0.0003 as well as maximum embedding capacity is increased up to 37  %. So that performance will be high with respect to PSNR, MSE, and maximum embedding capacity value. From Fig.  4, one can observe that there are no visual artifacts with the stego images and histograms, and it looks exactly the same as the corresponding original Brain disease cover images.|$|R

30|$|Mean traffic load. It {{measures}} the mean {{amount of data}} (in <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes)</b> that each MN generates or forwards. This measurement includes not only the traffic corresponding to document requests and replies, but also the overhead introduced by the routing protocol. Depending on the behaviour of the radio transceiver, this metric can {{give us an idea}} of the energy consumption of the MNs which are powered with limited batteries. Moreover, as more traffic is emitted in the network the wireless medium will experience more interferences and radio collisions.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of Mobile IP standard and VoIP functions makes the Mobile Voice over IP (Mobile VoIP) service feasible. In Mobile VoIP applications, the mobile users can dynamically move around different networks, and thus result in handoffs. Handoffs will introduce packets loss, and thus significantly drop {{the quality of}} service (QoS). To support the QoS, we propose in this paper a two-buffer packet lossless retransmission recovery scheme for Mobile VoIP handoff duration. For realizing the effects of handoff time on backup buffer overhead, we perform several realistic experiments with various wireless parameters, such as different AP (Access Point) signaling strengths, different traffic loads, different advertisement frequencies, and different number of mobile users. The experimental results show that, with our packet recovery scheme, the designated backup buffer size in general ranges from 7 to 10 <b>Kilo</b> <b>Bytes.</b> We thus conclude that our two-buffer recovery scheme is practical for current Mobile VoIP services...|$|R
40|$|The term Industrie 4. 0 {{carries the}} vision of smart factories, which {{automatically}} adapt to changes and assist the human {{as much as possible}} during operation and maintenance. This includes smart human machine interfaces, which reduce the chances of errors and help to make the right decisions. This paper presents an approach to equip the maintenance software running on a tablet PC with augmented reality functionality to be able to place virtual sticky notes at production modules. Additionally, these sticky notes are enriched with position information. The central element of this approach is an ontology-based context-aware framework, which aggregates and processes data from different sources. As a result, a tablet PC application was implemented, which allows displaying maintenance information as well as live plant process data in the form of augmented reality. More than 100 of those sticky notes can be placed using this system, whereas each note requires a file size of 12 to 16 <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes.</b> After placing a sticky note, the system recognizes it even if the camera's position is not exactly the same as during the placing process...|$|R

Cloud computing demands the reconfigurability on a sub-core basis to maximize the performance per customer application and the overall utilization of hardware resources in a data center. We propose the design of arithmetic units (AUs) using look-up tables (LUTs), which can also function as cache units. We imagine such LUT-based implementations of AUs and caches {{to be part of a}} malleable computing paradigm that allows the re-configuration of the core architecture inside a core and across cores. Our envisioned malleable computing can configure an LUT to behave as an AU or a cache at run time depending on the customers, their application requirements, and the computational demand in a data-center. To evaluate the scope for reconfigurability of LUTs, we determined the exchange rate between caches and AUs. This exchange rate tells us the cost of designing a LUT-based AU in <b>kilo</b> <b>bytes</b> of cache. In this thesis, we provide exchange rates for LUT-based adder and multiplier designs. For our analysis, we use CACTI 6. 5 to estimate the access time, area, and power of caches varying in size, number of banks, and set associativity, which we fitted by multinomial models. The delay time of these LUT-based designs is comparable to that of logic gate based designs of AUs using the logical effort theory for scaling. As delay time for LUT-based AUs we get 0. 5 ns to 1. 5 ns (2 GHz to 667 MHz) using the 45 nm Nangate open cell library. The cost of an adder ranges from 0. 125 kB to 5 kB cache size. The cost for an multiplier ranges from 2. 7 kB to 2. 8 kB cache size. The area for these LUT-based designs is smaller or equal compared to logic gate based adder and multiplier designs. Using RRAM technology the area can be reduced by two orders of magnitude with a slowdown in delay time by one order of magnitude. We also compared the robustness of our LUT-based adder and multiplier designs to logic gate equivalent adder and multiplier designs in presence of soft errors using analytical models and simulations. We show that LUT-based designs are more resilient toward soft errors when comparing output error rates of AUs. Our analytical models can help design robust AUs by quantifying design patterns in terms of their robustness. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
