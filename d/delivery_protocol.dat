40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} {{efficient}} and scalable streaming Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) {{is an open}} problem of great economic interest. A key decision {{is the number of}} replica servers to use and their location to balance network bandwidth and server costs. This problem is highly complex, since it is interrelated to the streaming media <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols,</b> client redirecting decisions, and the content delivery routing problem. To address this design problem, we develop heuristics for the server placement, the server selection, and the routing problem. In contrast to previous work, we study both periodic broadcast and hierarchical merging protocols using multiple media files with different request rates. The heuristics lead to highly accurate and fast approximations. We also analyze the relationship between the start-up delay caused by some <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols,</b> the bandwidth consumption, and the number of replica servers, providing complete and fully implementable solutions to the design of streaming CDNs.

40|$|Message <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} mechanisms in a mobile Agent system since cooperating mobile Agents need to communicate with each other. A generic framework is presented for designing mobile Agent message <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols.</b> The framework uses a flexible and adaptive mailbox-based scheme, which associates each mobile Agent with a mailbox while allowing the decoupling between them, i. e., a mobile Agent can migrate to a new site without bringing its mailbox. By separating the concerns of locating the mailbox of a mobile Agent and delivering a message to the Agent, a large space of protocol design with flexibility is obtained. Using a three-dimensional model based on the scheme, the generic framework not only covers, as particular cases, several known protocols, but also allows for the design of new ones suited for various application requirements. By extensive simulation experiments, trade-offs between design parameter selection and their impact on the performance of derived protocol are analyzed. The conclusion of analysis can be used to guide applications of the framework. Department of Computin...|$|R

It should consider, however, transport processes in these cases occur in a mechanically dynamic environment since mechanical stimuli may strongly influence transport within soft hydrated materials. A general framework combines fluid and macromolecular transport with the mechanics of hydrated polymer gels or tissue. As an example, the model equations have been created for a spherical geometry to describe the distribution of macromolecules within the gel resulting from a constant pressure or a constant flow infusion source. The model describes the overall average profiles of the interstitial fluid pressure, velocity and solid matrix dilatation, displacement, and stress, as well as macromolecular distribution. The basic theory provides new insight into understanding the transport of macromolecules within mechanically stimulated polymeric gets and tissues and, therefore, represents a valuable tool for designing and engineering novel {{drug delivery}} systems, as well as optimization of drug <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols</b> {{to be used in}} detection and treatments...|$|R

40|$|Two of the {{fundamental}} issues in designing protocols for message passing between mobile agents (MAs) are tracking the migration of the target agent and forwarding messages to it. Even with an ideal fault-free network-transport mechanism, messages can be dropped during MA migration. Therefore, {{in order to provide}} reliable message <b>delivery,</b> <b>protocols</b> need to overcome message loss caused by asynchronous operations of agent migration and message forwarding. In this paper, two known message forwarding approaches, namely push and pull, are explored to design adaptive and reliable message <b>delivery</b> <b>protocols.</b> Based on a commonly used MA tracking model, {{the pros and cons of}} these two approaches are evaluated, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The comparative performance evaluation is presented in terms of network traffic and delay in message processing. We also propose improvements to the pull approach to reduce network traffic and the message delay. We conclude that with different message passing and migration patterns and varying requirements of real-time message processing, specific applications can select different message delivery approaches to achieve the desired level of performance and flexibility.
