25|$|In September 1866 a {{party of}} 80 men from the Ngāti Hineuru iwi—whose main villages were at Te Haroto and Tarawera, midway between Napier and Taupo—marched towards Napier, {{accompanied}} by another 20 Māori from elsewhere in the North Island. Two months earlier their chiefs had written to McLean, the Crown's chief land purchase agent and the senior Crown official in Hawke's Bay, responding to his <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> peace terms and advising that they would lead a party to Napier to meet him. The chiefs also held grievances over previous land sales in the area which they wished to discuss. The party, led by Pai Mārire prophet Panapa and chiefs Nikora, Kipa, Kingita and Petera Kahuroa, as well as Ngāti Tuwharetoa chief Te Rangitahau, stayed for several weeks at Petane, north of Napier. On 4 October most of the party moved {{to the village of}} Omarunui, about 10km southwest of Napier, while the original occupants moved out. McLean, alerted to their arrival at Omarunui, sent a messenger on 5 October demanding that they explain their intentions and over the following three days the chiefs wrote to McLean indicating they wished to take meet him. On 8 October, concluding they were a threat to the Napier settlement, McLean warned the Omarunui encampment that they should return home or they would be attacked.|$|E

5000|$|Later in July 1999, Constantinescu was {{reported}} as accusing {{the west of}} [...] "indifference" [...] to Romania.

50|$|On May 3, 2012, Needelman {{issued an}} <b>Invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>Negotiate</b> (ITN) for a {{contract}} to digitize old county records which were then being stored in a gymnasium. This ITN, which was reportedly written by BlueWare itself, allowed only eight days to submit bids, which prevented other firms {{the time needed to}} prepare. Selection of a bid was made only 5 days later. BlueWare, which had never performed such services for government before, submitted a bid of $8.5 million under the company name BlueGem, Inc. Despite the short time-frame, the experienced document imaging company FNTI had submitted a bid of $3.5 million. On May 23, BlueWare was wired an additional $500,000. The contract was signed on June 29, and BlueWare received its first monthly payment of $90,000.|$|E

This was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. This force included 1,000 Sahaba (companions of Muhammad), among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah.|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} we investigated how group power influences the way members of groups in asymmetrical conflict approach negotiations. Drawing on theories of negotiations and of intergroup power, we predicted that group power would interact with {{features of the}} proposed negotiating agenda to influence willingness to ‘come to the table’. Based on the negotiation literature, we focused on two types of ‘sequential ’ negotiation agendas: one beginning with the discussion of consequential issues before less consequential issues ('consequential first'), and one leaving the discussion of consequential issues until after less consequential issues are discussed ('consequential later'). Because they are motivated to advance changes to their disadvantaged status quo, we expected low power group members to favor ‘consequential first ’ over ‘consequential later’ invitations to negotiate. High power group members, motivated to protect their advantage, were expected to show the reverse preference. Converging evidence from five experiments involving real-world and experimental groups supported these predictions. Across studies participants received an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> {{from the other side}} involving either a 'consequential first ' or 'consequential later ' agenda. Low power group members preferred ‘consequential first ’ invitations because these implied less stalling of change to the status quo, and high power group members preferred 'consequential later ' invitations because these invitations seemed to pose less threat to their position. Theoretical and practical implications for negotiations research and conflict resolution are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|An <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat {{is not an}} offer, but an {{indication}} of a person's willingness <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a contract. It's a pre-offer communication. In Harvey v. Facey, {{an indication}} by the owner of property {{that he or she}} might be interested in selling at a certain price, for example, has been regarded as an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat. Similarly in Gibson v Manchester City Council the words [...] "may be prepared to sell" [...] were held to be a notification of price and therefore not a distinct offer, though in another case concerning the same change of policy (Manchester City Council underwent a change of political control and stopped the sale of council houses to their tenants) Storer v. Manchester City Council, the court held that an agreement was completed by the tenant's signing and returning the agreement to purchase, as the language of the agreement had been sufficiently explicit and the signature on behalf of the council a mere formality to be completed. Statements of invitation are only intended to solicit offers from people and are not intended to result in any immediate binding obligation. The courts have tended to take a consistent approach to the identification of <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> treat, as compared with offer and acceptance, in common transactions. The display of goods for sale, whether in a shop window or on the shelves of a self-service store, is ordinarily treated as an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> treat and not an offer.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{the purpose}} of this {{publication}} is to assess legal guaranties of competition (free competition) between contractors in broadly perceived process of granting public procurement, which means not only entering into a contract subject to the specific legal regime, concluded by a public purchaser, or possible private purchaser subordinated to that legal regime, with a contractor (contractors) in order to satisfy its demand for certain goods or services, but also a due course of the whole process of granting public procurement, perceived as a sequence of factual and legal actions beginning with the moment of public announcement of a procurement, sending an invitation for submitting offers or sending <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> for selection of an offer of a given contractor, up till final fulfilment of all obligations of the parties under the public procurement contract.  Methods: the major research method is the dogmatic-legal method, namely an analysis of legal text of different laws. Moreover, there is a critical analysis of scholar literature. The most important in this context is to indicate mutual co-relations between competition and fair competition in area of public procurement system and to point other major principles of the public procurement process, such as non-discrimination rule, transparency, impartiality and objectiveness rule, legality rule, openness, rule of written form, primate of using tender mode (competitive mode, in another words it is a rule of extraordinary application of non-competitive modes or primate of granting public procurement in a tender mode). All of those rules constitute together components of the guarantee of genuine competition within the whole process of granting a public procurement. It must be stressed that the literature in the area of research in not really rich. This is accurate in terms of Polish literature and EU literature, too. Results. Conclusions and relevance: results of the research are such that new 2014 EU public procurement directives, viz. Directive 2014 / 23 / EU, Directive 2014 / 24 /EU and Directive 2014 / 25 /EU, are not really aimed at fostering the competition as the main goal. Nevertheless, a specific and deep analysis of regulation of mentioned directives leads to the conclusion that those directives provide for bigger and broader economic competition. This is achieved generally thanks to opening of the public procurement market for micro, small and medium enterprises (SMBs’ sector).  </p...|$|E
