I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Department of State {{spokesman}} Nicholas Burns {{rejected the}} Nazi comparisons {{in the open}} letter as [...] "outrageous" [...] and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, [...] "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." [...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it [...] "don't <b>know</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> about Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E

[...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "the album [...] opens with its most tender ballad, a slow-burning number that calls back to both Sam Cooke's 'Wonderful World' and Prince's 'Purple Rain' without {{sounding}} like a retread of either tune [...] it sounds best in the context of the album, where its slow, steady build to a cathartic guitar break is the perfect introduction to a set of mostly low-key tracks about love and heartbreak." [...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an ellipsis and it's so damn beautiful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Shane Warne {{signed a}} lucrative multi-year {{sponsorship}} deal with Messages On Hold. The irony of Warne promoting On Hold phone messages after weathering the ignominy of several SMS/text messaging scandals {{was not lost}} on the spin bowler.

Actress Patsy Kelly confirmed she had {{a sexual relationship with}} Bankhead when she worked for her as a personal assistant.
