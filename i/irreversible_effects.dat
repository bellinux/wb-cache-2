25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase {{because they have no}} DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the <b>irreversible</b> <b>effects</b> of aspirin.|$|E
25|$|When the Board of Control {{published}} {{their second}} survey in 1961 {{the use of}} psychosurgery had declined by more than half; the decline being attributed to {{an awareness of the}} risks of <b>irreversible</b> <b>effects</b> and the introduction in 1955 of neuroleptic drugs. By 1961 nearly half of mental hospitals in the United Kingdom were no longer carrying out leucotomies. Approximately 500 operations were performed a year, and were unevenly distributed over the country. Someone hospitalised in the North East Metropolitan region was more than 15 times more likely to undergo psychosurgery than someone hospitalised in the neighbouring East Anglian region. There were also random differences in the type of operation used and the type of illness treated. Twenty per cent of operations were still standard pre-frontal leucotomies; the rest were new operations, and a few centres used stereotactic techniques. Some hospitals still used psychosurgery to treat chronic schizophrenia, in others the only indications were depression or obsessive illness.|$|E

40|$|In acromegaly, {{overproduction}} of GH and IGF-I causes abnormal {{extracellular matrix}} regulation. We hypothesized {{that this may}} predispose {{to the development of}} colonic diverticula. Because the relation between acromegaly and colonic diverticula is unknown, the study aim was to assess the prevalence of colonic diverticula in patients with cured acromegaly. This was a case-control study. We screened reports of colonoscopies performed for the purpose of screening for polyps in 107 patients with cured or biochemically controlled acromegaly and in 214 age- and sex-matched controls for the presence of diverticula, dolichocolon, and polyps. In patients, the findings were related to GH/IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly and to the duration of GH/IGF-I excess. In acromegaly, colonic diverticula were present in 37 % of patients, dolichocolon in 34 %, and adenomatous polyps in 34 %, which was increased compared with controls (odds ratio 3. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4, 5. 7; 12. 4, 95 % confidence interval 6. 8, 18. 0; 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9, 6. 4, respectively). The presence of colonic diverticula was associated with both GH and IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly, when adjusted for the duration of active disease. The presence of dolichocolon and adenomatous polyps was associated with higher IGF-I concentrations at diagnosis. Acromegaly is associated with an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula. In addition to the known <b>irreversible</b> <b>effect</b> of GH excess on collagen of joints and cardiac valves, this observation indicates an <b>irreversible</b> <b>effect</b> of GH and/or IGF-I on the collagen in the colo...|$|R
