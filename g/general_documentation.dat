Methods: Retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to a teaching hospital Acute Medical Admissions Unit over a three month period with a presenting complaint of headache. Results: 106 patients presented with headache of whom 48 patients had at least one LP attempted. Only 41 patients (85 %, 95 % CI 72 - 94) had their LP documented. Out of 47 patients that had a successful LP, 22 (47 %) had a recorded {{opening pressure}}. 18 (32 %) of all patients had their position recorded, with 7 (15 %) patients having had position and opening pressure documented. 20 patients (43 %) had the appropriate results documented. 12 patients (31 %) had paired venous blood glucose measured.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{this film}} test to evaluate several manufacturers' photographic films {{for their ability}} to acquire imagery on the International Space Station. We selected 25 motion picture, photographic slide, and negative films from three different film manufacturers. We based this selection on the fact that their films ranked highest in other similar film tests, and on their general acceptance by the international community. This test differed from previous tests because the entire evaluation process leading up to the final selection was based on information derived after the original flight film was scanned to a digital file. Previously conducted tests were evaluated entirely based on 8 x 10 s that were produced from the film either directly or through the internegative process. This new evaluation procedure provided accurate quantitative data on granularity and contrast from the digital data. This test did not try to define which film was best visually. This is too often based on personal preference. However, the test results did group the films by good, marginal, and unacceptable. We developed, and included in this report, a template containing quantitative, graphical, and visual information for each film. These templates should be sufficient for comparing the different films tested and subsequently selecting a film or films to be used for experiments and <b>general</b> <b>documentation</b> on the International Space Station...|$|E
40|$|To {{utilize the}} {{potential}} of software architecture {{it is essential to}} make it explicit. Architects produce architecture documentation when designing systems and provide it to developers who use it as the basis for their implementation tasks. However, the views of architects and developers on the system diverge: architects look at the system as a whole, developers have a more local perspective, focusing on the elements and context they are responsible for. The comprehensive architecture documentation produced by architects does not take this divergence into account. Although all needed information may be included, the information overhead and suboptimal representation render such generic architecture documentation inadequate to be used without adaptation for all implementation tasks. To overcome this deficiency, the doctoral thesis presented in this paper proposes an approach for the creation of architecture documentation that is tailored to specific implementation tasks. Such documentation shall contain all relevant, but only a minimum of overhead information and present {{it in a way that}} allows developers to perform their implementation tasks efficiently, with high-quality results. By using automated generation techniques that derive the task-specific architecture documentation from the <b>general</b> <b>documentation,</b> it is possible to largely avoid impacts on architects' normal way of working. To achieve applicability of the approach in practice, ideas for tool support, integrated into an existing modeling environment are highlighted. Finally, ideas for the validation of the expected benefits, the current status of the doctoral thesis, as well as next steps and possible future extensions are presented...|$|E

In addition more information about SIPP {{can be found in the}} SIPP Quality Profile, working papers distributed by the Census Bureau, articles published in academic journals, and conference proceedings. This chapter discusses SIPP published estimates, briefly describes the data files and supporting documentation, and provides information on how to obtain them. Published Estimates from SIPP Published estimates from SIPP data are useful to data analysts in a number of ways. First, Census Bureau publications may already contain the estimates needed for the research project at hand, thus saving users the having to create those estimates themselves. Second, published estimates can often provide a useful cross-check for closely related estimates prepared by analysts. Published estimates are based on the Census Bureau‘s internal data files. The internal files are not top-coded, however the public use files have been top-coded and some data suppressed to protect respondent confidentiality. It is expected, therefore, that outside analysts will often not be able to replicate published estimates exactly. The Census Bureau's P- 70 series of publications is a primary source for published estimates from SIPP. Table 5 - 1 displays the titles and publication numbers of reports in the series that are currently available from the Census Bureau. Copies of those reports can be obtained from th...|$|E
