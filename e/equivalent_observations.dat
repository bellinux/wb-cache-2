METHODS: Randomly select 60 patients to our hospital check-up successfully with ortho-k lens of juvenile myopia patients as experimental group, and 60 cases were randomly selected given frame glasses as control group. we observed two groups of patients before and after refractive correction the changes of AC/A and spherical <b>equivalent.</b> <b>Observation</b> time was 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year. RESULTS: The AC/A of experimental group worn glasses before and after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year were 4. 05 ± 2. 03, 3. 05 ± 1. 85, 3. 31 ± 1. 02, 3. 14 ± 1. 64 and 3. 20 ± 1. 55,respectively with statistically significant difference(P P > 0. 05).

40|$|Australian {{universities}} are multi-million dollar operations employing {{tens of thousands}} of people. They attract revenue from a variety of government and non-government sources, and yet, as non-profit organisations they are judged by governments, peers and their communities on their performance in teaching and research rather than on a financial bottom line. In order to achieve these results, university managers must make decisions on how to allocate available funding throughout the university. Faced with competing demands on scarce funds, how do university managers make these choices? One option is to use a resource allocation model to 'crunch the numbers'. Resource allocation models can incorporate a number of elements [...] student and staff numbers, weightings and performance data, for example [...] to allocate available funds. These allocation models are used in different ways in different universities, but serve the same basic purpose of assisting decision-making on how much to allocate to different sections of the organisation. Such models operate within a process and context that includes the strategic aims of the University, the organisation structure, its committees and culture. This thesis contains case studies of resource allocation models and processes used in three Australian universities. It examines the methods used for resource allocation at the first and second levels within each university; that is, from the Vice-Chancellor to Dean (or equivalent), and from Dean to Head of School (or <b>equivalent).</b> <b>Observations</b> and conclusions are drawn on the models used, the processes surrounding the models, and the continuity between the two layers of allocations. The research finds all the case-study universities operate models at multiple levels in their organisations, {{and that there is a}} concerning lack of consistency and flow-through at these different levels. The messages that the university leadership intends to send through the allocations may be lost to managers one-process removed from them. The research also concludes that transparency is the most important element of the resource allocation process. University staff dealing with allocation processes will accept the results, even if they are not ideal, if they can understand how and why decisions were made. As a professional doctorate thesis, the aim is to provide a practical aid to people with responsibility for resource allocation in universities...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{variability}} in cortical activation during physical air-rifle shooting and three different observation conditions. Elite air-rifle shooters performed a 40 shot individual match. Electroencephalograms were recorded from 11 active sites across the cortex during the final 6 s (3 × 2 s epochs) before shot release. Data collection was repeated while shooters watched a large-screen video of their worst shot performance from an internal-visual perspective when seated, standing and standing holding their rifle. The hypothesized differences between the three observation conditions and the physical shooting profile were not shown except at the left anterior temporal site, T 5. This finding suggests that observation of performance cannot be differentiated clearly by posture or modified through kinetic and haptic afference, and that visual percepts predominate in observational functional equivalence. However, more functionally <b>equivalent</b> <b>observation</b> reduced the observation/execution variability over the temporal areas. Performer debriefs also identified different perceptions of physiological, psychological and behavioural functional equivalence associated with the different observation conditions. We conclude that elite performers' brains are accessed equally effectively during different observation conditions irrespective of some of the physical factors ascribed to the conditions.

Nevertheless, no <b>equivalent</b> <b>observation</b> for the SNRI duloxetine {{has been made to}} date. Method: Sixteen patients diagnosed with MDD and an actual major depressive episode according to DSM-IV criteria and 16 healthy controls entered a 6 -week trial with duloxetine 60 mg/day. All subjects (n = 32) were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and were monitored for IL- 6 levels both at baseline and at week 6. Blood samples for IL- 6 levels were evaluated by ELISA. Results: After 6 weeks of treatment, the mean total scores for HAM-D declined both in the depressed and control groups, while IL- 6 modification showed an opposite trend both in depressed (12. 38 &plusmn; 19. 80 to 19. 73 &plusmn; 18. 94 pg/mL) and control subjects (12. 25 &plusmn; 21. 12 to 17. 63 &plusmn; 20. 44 pg/mL), as did YMRS (ns), although none of the subjects switched to (hypo) mania. Of note, IL- 6 levels increased significantly only in the responders subgroup (n = 9; P = 0. 012). Conclusion: The small sample size and weak design of this study limit the validity of our results, which should be regarded as preliminary only. Nonetheless, the trend of increasing IL- 6 levels observed in responder patients treated with duloxetine should prompt further controlled, extended studies with larger samples, with the specific aim of better assessing a putative differential role of norepinephrinergic antidepressant stimulation of serotonergic reuptake inhibition in determining modifications in IL- 6 levels. Ideally, more accurate replication studies may contribute to further understanding of the complex interaction of mood, antidepressant response, and the immune system.
