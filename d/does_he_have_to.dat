50|$|The French poet Chrétien de Troyes {{created a}} version of a naive, victimised King Arthur who is cuckolded by his {{allegedly}} best friend Lancelot and left by his knights who rather seek for the Holy Grail than to stand by his side while Mordred {{is about to become}} Arthur's nemesis. Films like First Knight that pick up these motifs, depict Arthur as a King whose Britons fail him and who lives in a gigantic castle which must have required such a great deal of drudgery {{that it is hard to}} believe in his legendary popularity. Finally he dies tragically. In Arthur of the Britons the protagonist does not die, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> escape to Avalon or Brittany in France. In the penultimate episode, which probably should have been the second-season finale, under threat of attack by the Scots, Arthur comes close to securing a treaty between himself, Cerdig and Yorath the Jute, but a carelessly placed target board results in a death, and old hostilities quickly re-surface. Arthur and his men return home, disappointed, but still hopeful that one day, there will be a lasting peace.|$|E

[...] In an AllMusic review of the 2008 compilation The Best of Steve Harley, Thompson also wrote: [...] "...the real meat, however, lies among the excerpted album cuts, as the compilers treat all seven original Harley/Cockney Rebel LPs with more or less equal respect - many fans would have drawn a line after the first three. But [...] "White White Dove," [...] "Roll the Dice," [...] and the like all deserve a fresh hearing." [...] For his review website, George Starostin said: [...] "Elsewhere, you'll find stuff that doesn't raise your eyebrow up to the skies, but is nowhere near dismissable. [...] "Roll the Dice" [...] has a decent pop hook, certainly not worse than anything contemporary by the Cars or Blondie." ...|$|E
5000|$|Walkways and Flagpoles: The {{teams are}} each tasked with laying a {{concrete}} walkway to their cabins, along with erecting a flagpole. The flagpole’s hole {{will have to}} be dug out using a mechanical auger, to a depth of 23 inches. Helder gives the teams a lesson, and emphasizes the importance of safety. The twist is that the teams each only get the first 10 minutes working together and then have to alternate [...] "tag team" [...] style, which means that the holes must be dug in the first 10 minutes due to the requirement for two people to operate the auger. Immediately after the first team switch is called out, Steve commits a serious violation of the safety regulations by attempting to operate the auger himself after failing to reach the required 23-inch depth in the initial 10 minutes. Helder is enraged by this, and even more by the fact that not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> yell at Steve four times before he shuts the auger off, Steve then gets in Helder’s face and shouts about the challenge being unfair. Steve continues to argue the point, eventually resulting in Richelene having to step in and talk him down; Steve then angrily throws the auger aside, and [...] "accidentally" [...] breaks the team’s shovel when attempting to continue digging the hole, before demanding to use the auger again, and then angrily throwing his building supplies around the cabin. Realising that Steve’s behaviour has disrupted the challenge too badly for it to continue (in particular, the Pink and Blue Teams, located next to the Purple Team, both stopped working and were left visibly shaken), the experts call a halt to the challenge. No-one is declared the winner.|$|E
5000|$|The world-famous {{hair salon}} franchise, Neo-Image has opened and its top three hairstylists - Ya Si (Ming Dao), Er Qi (Sam Wang Shao Wei), and Fei Nan Du's (Jacky Zhu Fan Gang) {{handsome}} hairstyles attracted huge crowds. At this time, a foreign affairs government official rushed over {{and asked them}} for help. It turns out that a shampoo company is conducting an event called the [...] "Asian Hairstyle Competition" [...] and they have hired a part-time female hairstylist to compete against the top-notch French hairstylist. Their objective is to help advertise the French Hair products. Since this event will seriously belittle the country's image, Ya Si and the guys decided to help out. Ya Si and the guys replaced the part-time female hairstylist to help gain some glory for their country. When the dazzling model {{came out with the}} beautiful hairstyle, Ya Si and the guys received cheers fit for a hero. The female hairstylist that they chased off the stage is none other than Nuo Ruo Yi (Xiao Bei), a worker from [...] "Zhong Nan Barbershop," [...] Neo-Image's neighbor over the next alley. Even though Ya Si has chased Xiao Bei off the stage, but seeing her snip her first cut, he decided that she has quite the talent and secretly plots to win her over. Neo-Image's grand opening is a serious blow to the family-run style [...] "Zhong Nan Barbershop." [...] Zhong Nan's owner is called Lao Bei (Zhao Shun) and he opened up this barbershop after retiring from the army. Now that there is a brand new and fashionable hair salon {{at the front of the}} alley, it is only natural that their customers are decreasing day by day. Even more importantly is that his daughter, Xiao Bei's heart, has already been deeply captivated by Neo-Image's glory. Chou Mei (Qiu Shu Fang) followed Ya Si through 18 towns and finally got the chance to have him change her hairstyle. On Neo-Image's opening night, Chou Mei went into the store's [...] "Magic Room" [...] and didn't come back out. Through the darkness of the window, Xiao Bei saw Fei Nan Du wielding his knife and blood splashing out; Neo-Image's back door, Xiao Bei saw Er Qi handing over a large canvas bag to two guys. Xiao Bei believes that Chou Mei must have met with an accident and hence, decided to report it to the police. Ya Si and the guys were brought to the police station and Xiao Bei called for a press conference at Zhong Nan to account for the [...] "murder" [...] that she witnessed. Not long after that, Chou Mei returns home and put an end to this whole ridiculous matter. Unfortunately, when the truth comes out, it was already too late to stop the submission of the newspaper article. [...] The next day, [...] "Suspicious Murder Case" [...] made the headline news and Fei Nan Du urgently called for a press conference in front of the store. In the middle of his explanation, the Chief of Defense Force arrived at Zhong Nan Barbershop. The reporters went crazy and starts asking about the army's military exercise practices. Ya Si and Xiao Bei bets on the headline news for the next day. Unfortunately, Ya Si lost to Xiao Bei and as a result, not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take wedding photos with Chou Mei but he also has to sleep overnight at the [...] "haunted room" [...] on Zhong Nan's top floor. A drunken Ya Si mistakes Xiao Bei to be Qing Kong and gives her a tender hug. Unfortunately, Zhe Ming (Ehlo Huang Yu Rong) unknowingly locks the door and Ya Si and Xiao Bie unexpectedly spends a night together… [...] Half a year ago, in a car accident in England, Ya Si lost both his mother and younger brother, but he didn't dare to tell this truth to his grandmother, Li Lian Nai Nai, who lives at Healthy Life Manor House.

40|$|Consider the {{following}} explanation: (1) George took his umbrella {{because it was}} just about to rain. This is an explanation of a quite distinctive sort. It is profoundly different from the sort of explanation we might use to explain, say, the movements of a bouncing ball or the gradual rise of the tide on a beach. Unlike these other types of explanations, it explains an agent’s behavior by describing the agent’s own reasons for performing that behavior. Explanations that work in this way have a number of distinctive and important properties, and we will refer to them here as reason explanations. Looking at the use of reason explanations with a philosophical eye, one is apt to experience a certain puzzlement. One wants to know precisely what makes a given reason explanation true or false. So, for example, the explanation given above seems to be saying that George’s reason for taking his umbrella was that it was just about to rain.
