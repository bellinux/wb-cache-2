5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> German affairs, so too would Britain be <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very}} little volume that is <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
