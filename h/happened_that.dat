5|$|Total drew {{attention}} to the unexplained absence from his post of the Gulf employee whose duty it was to supervise the unloading from the on-shore control room. The individual concerned had left the control room some time before the trouble started (see below) and his absence may have contributed to a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E

Sharona's theory {{is supported by the}} fact that St. Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> day.|$|E

25|$|During {{the night}} of September 25, the fire emitted was quite {{extraordinary}} and accompanied by terrifying rumblings.

25|$|Having been idle for a week, the Spurs {{opened the}} game in lackluster fashion – in the first eight minutes the Spurs trailed 19–7 – but were able to fight back and {{stabilize}} the game.

25|$|What exactly <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> {{night is}} disputed.

Rearguard actions by reinforcements from Lee's Corps kept the retreat from becoming a rout. With the collapse of the Confederate left, Cheatham's and Lee's Corps followed to the new line.|$|E

25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> day but will never tell.|$|E
25|$|It often <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> {{the number}} of lay {{brothers}} became excessive and {{out of proportion to}} the resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey. On the other hand, at any rate in some countries, the system of lay brothers in course of time worked itself out; thus in England by the close of the 14th century it had shrunk to relatively small proportions, and in the 15th century the régime of the English Cistercian houses tended to approximate more and more to that of the Black Monks.|$|E
