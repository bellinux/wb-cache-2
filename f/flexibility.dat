5|$|Cognitive <b>flexibility</b> can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A {{synthesized}} research definition of cognitive <b>flexibility</b> is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive <b>flexibility</b> include mental <b>flexibility,</b> mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive <b>flexibility</b> {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive <b>flexibility</b> {{has been shown to be}} a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive <b>flexibility</b> {{has been}} more broadly {{described}} {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive <b>flexibility.</b> According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive <b>flexibility</b> has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive <b>flexibility</b> varies {{during the}} {{lifespan}} of an individual.

40|$|In 2005, India amended its Patents Act, 1970 to {{introduce}} TRIPS compliant product patent regime. Generally speaking, {{law and policy}} makers in India {{during the time of}} the amendment were confronted with two major concerns viz. the future of the Indian pharmaceutical industry and access to affordable medicines in India and other developing countries. To address these concerns India along with many other developing countries attempted to incorporate TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> in their domestic law. However, the success of the TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> in addressing the question of access to affordable medicines mainly depends on three factors: a) the incorporation of <b>flexibilities</b> in the domestic law; b) the manufacturing capability of a country; and c) the political will to use the public interest safeguards provided in the domestic law. There are only a few countries like India, which satisfy the above-mentioned conditions to a certain extent. This article examines whether these premises hold true after five years into the implementation of the TRIPS compliant patent system in India. In this context the paper identifies and analyzes the legal, policy and institutional challenges that India is currently facing in the implementation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities.</b> It also identifies the main legal, policy and institutional disconnect in the implementation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> in India. It argues that to effectively use TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> to address access to affordable medicines require changes in three areas viz. law, policy and institutions. It clearly shows that mere incorporation of TRIPS <b>flexibilities</b> in the domestic legislation alone is not enough and the domestic legislation needs to be complemented with policy and institutional framework. ...|$|R

5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive <b>flexibility</b> plays in education is the argument that how students are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive <b>flexibility</b> into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive <b>flexibility,</b> and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to valuate}} <b>flexibilities</b> in a {{large-scale}} railroad construction project. In general, a railroad construction project involves {{a large amount}} of <b>flexibilities</b> due to its long construction period and conflicts among various participants. Therefore, railroad construction projects require investors to examine the feasibility of the project, taking into account managers' ability to make strategic decisions to deal with <b>flexibilities</b> during the construction. However. this important value is not considered in conventional valuation methods, such as Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) analysis. This study introduces methods to identify and valuate the <b>flexibilities</b> involved in a project. Decision Tree Analysis (DTA) and Real Option Analysis (ROA) are mainly discussed as primary methods to avoid pitfalls of the conventional valuation methods. DTA helps managers to make future decisions in an effective way by providing graphical diagrams of decision opportunities. ROA appraises the value of mitigating risks by allowing managers to defer investing decisions until a situation that affects a project's success seriously becomes obvious. As a case study, the additional station construction projects in Incheon International Airport Railroad (IIAR) are analyzed to apply the methodologies to valuate the <b>flexibilities.</b> The case study shows that the use of DTA and ROA enables us to visualize the risks, and to quantify the value of <b>flexibilities</b> in the project. by Choong Ryun Oh.

40|$|Power {{purchase}} and sale contracts in Brazil, have been receiving {{attention in the}} last few years due to the high volatility of electricity spot price (PLD) and the regulatory constraints to operate in the brazilian electricity market. In this scenario, even when contract content is clearly understood by the parties, uncertainties are commonly not well measured and <b>flexibilities</b> are not correctly priced. One reason is the limitation of traditional financial techniques for pricing contracts which often did not adequately take into account some important features, mispricing embedded <b>flexibilities.</b> These <b>flexibilities</b> can be seen as options by the purchasers, in the way to choose the amount of energy to be supplied (amount option) or to reduce the amount or even to interrupt the supply during a predetermined interval (reduction option). In this working progress paper, we present what is intended to investigate in the final study about valuing these <b>flexibilities</b> in bilateral contracts in the Brazilian electricity market, using real options approach. These <b>flexibilities</b> are modeled as compound European call and put options, under uncertainties of monthly energy price and energy demand.

The present paper presents econometric evidence on such price-quantity relationships for major species of cut flowers at the Dutch flower auctions. Specifically, an inverse linear approximate almost ideal demand model with seasonal adjustments is applied. This paper is introducing trigonometric functions as a flexible and inexpensive alternative that outperforms standard seasonal dummies. Major findings are that all <b>flexibilities</b> (quantity elasticities) are strongly significant. Own price <b>flexibilities</b> are negative as expected. The own <b>flexibilities</b> vary substantially across the different species. The estimates indicate different effects from strategic marketing behavior across producers of different species. While some "concerted action" among chrysanthemum producers in terms of supply adjustments may have significant price effects, such behavior for producers of carnations appears to have less impact. Most cross <b>flexibilities</b> are negative, thus, the different cut flowers appear to be quantity-substitutes. Based on the estimated values for price and scale <b>flexibilities,</b> a potential for strategic marketing or market timing seems to exist. Utilizing this information, in given weeks even relatively small producers may be big enough to influence the prices, i. e. there exists a potential for "flower power" at the Dutch Flower Auctions.
