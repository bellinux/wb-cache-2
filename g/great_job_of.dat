Seafaring is a hazardous occupation and has to conduct with uncertain conditions and bad weather. Moreover, seafarers faced isolation, far from family and society. Nevertheless, the seafarer occupation is still in demand in Myanmar. Thus, an online self-completion questionnaire is distributed through social media to describe lives of Myanmar seafarers which focus on their working conditions, family relationships, job satisfaction and work motivation. From this study, there are some conclusions after data analysis. First, better working conditions generates <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> Myanmar seafarers. Second, the better family relationships not generate <b>greater</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> Myanmar seafarers. Thereafter, work motivation generates stronger relationship between working conditions and job satisfaction...|$|R
