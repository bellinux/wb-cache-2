The latter has a somewhat longer travel time, since <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> stops along the way. The Unionsexpressen trains were hauled by Ofotbanen-operated Rc-locomotives leased from SJ. Each train had four cars, of which three were open seating, {{and one was}} a dining car. The service had higher prices than the SJ service, but instead offers more luxury. The founders stated that the service is inspired by the Orient Express. With a full restaurant on board, fresh-made meals can be purchased, along with beverages. The seating compartments are newly renovated, with wooden interior, three-abreast seating and Wi-Fi.|$|E

The decision to use a stay-at-home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons. At the same time, women are progressing into higher-paying jobs. There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay-at-home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher-paid parent, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role.

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea found Second Sons open world {{beholden to}} a dated formula.

CVGs Hussain called Seattle [...] "hauntingly empty", with the sparsely distributed NPCs behaving inanimately. He felt that the open world's lifelessness was the game's biggest detractor, and he drew unfavorable comparison with Grand Theft Auto V, Sleeping Dogs and , which he felt featured better open worlds. Eurogamer's Welsh felt that Second Son did not innovate the open world genre as well as it could have because it relied too heavily on many of the genre's tropes. Polygon's Kollar felt that there was not enough variation in the missions and activities, as [...] "virtually all culminate in the goal of beating up more soldiers or thugs".

The film achieved notoriety for its final scene, which involves Sevigny performing unsimulated fellatio on star and director Vincent Gallo. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and opened to significant controversy and criticism from audiences and critics. She went on to defend the movie, [...] "It's a shame people write so many things when they haven't seen it. When you see the film, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> sense. It's an art film. It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie." [...] After the film's release at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the William Morris Agency terminated Sevigny as a client. The agency believed the scene was [...] "one step above pornography", and claimed that Sevigny's career [...] "may never recover". In an interview with The Telegraph in 2003, when asked if she regretted the film, she responded: [...] "No, I was always committed to the project {{on the strength of}} Vincent alone.

500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information needed to make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is like a miniature and very complex factory that {{can make all the}} parts needed to produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein to do this job. Similarly, if a cell needs to do something faster or slower than before, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what to do by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|E
