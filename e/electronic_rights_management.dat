40|$|The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a trade agreement, {{which seeks}} to {{regulate}} copyright law, intermediary liability, and technological protection measures. The United States Government under President Barack Obama sought to export key features of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US) (DMCA). Drawing upon the work of Joseph Stiglitz, this paper expresses concerns that the TPP would entrench DMCA measures into the laws of a dozen Pacific Rim countries. This study examines four key jurisdictions—the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—participating in the TPP. This paper has three main parts. Part 2 focuses upon the takedown-and-notice scheme, safe harbours, and intermediary liability under the TPP. Elements of the safe harbours regime in the DMCA have been embedded into the international agreement.

40|$|The thesis {{starts in}} Chapter 1 by {{providing}} the background {{to the development of}} the Thai copyright exceptions and the prospective Thai-US Free Trade Area (FTA) Agreements. In Chapter 2, I identify three major problems which arise from the inappropriate and unclear educational exceptions of the Thai CA 1994. The first problem is that the copyright law and its exceptions cannot effectively protect the economic interest of copyright owners but rather reduce the effectiveness of the copyright protection regime in Thailand as a result of three factors: the unclear educational exceptions; the problematic approaches to the copyright exceptions of the Thai IP Court; and the lack of a copyright collecting society (CCS) and a licensing scheme system in the Thai education sector. The second problem is that the Thai educational exceptions do not properly protect the moral right to be recognized as the author of the work in both the general and digital contexts. Finally, they do not support the long-distance education and lifelong learning policy of the Thai government as well as preventing educational institutions, teachers and students from the benefit of new digital technologies. The thesis recommends that the following tasks be carried out in order to solve the above problems. First, reforms must be made to the educational exceptions in the Thai CA 1994 in order to make them more restrictive and limited than at present. For instance, a clear limitation, a prohibition on multiple reproductions, and a requirement of sufficient acknowledgment must be inserted into the educational exceptions of the Thai CA 1994. Second, I recommend the introduction of digital copyright provisions on Technological Protection Measures (TPMs) and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Management</b> Information (RMIs) into the Thai copyright system. This is necessary in order to ensure that educational materials can be made readily available online for distance education purposes with appropriate protection. These can also protect the economic interests of copyright owners in the digital environment by ensuring that only authorised persons access educational materials, not the public in general. Nevertheless, it is also necessary to ensure that non-infringing uses for educational purposes provided in the copyright exceptions of the Thai CA 1994 will be exempted from the violation of the prospective TPM and RMI provisions. Third, I argue that legislative reform to the educational exceptions and the introduction of the TPM and RMI provisions alone cannot completely solve the problem because the increased numbers of copyright infringements in the Thai education sector result from both the unclear exceptions and the lack of a CCS. Thus, the reforms of the exceptions and the introduction of new law must be carried out together with the establishment of the CCS and a licensing scheme system in the Thai education sector. Nevertheless, the establishment of the CCS without any legal controls upon its activities would result in further problems, so I contend that such establishment must be done together with the introduction of a regulation and a governmental body to prevent the CCS from abusing its licensing scheme or its powers in an anticompetitive way. Finally, the thesis points out several useful lessons arising from the study of the Thai copyright exceptions which could benefit global copyright protection and other countries. I have sought to state the law as it stood at the end of September 2010...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary This {{submission}} {{provides a}} {{critical analysis of}} the copyright sections of Chapter 18 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on intellectual property. In National Interest Analysis, the Australian Government asserts that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a merely recapitulation of existing agreements: "The TPP Intellectual Property Chapter is consistent with Australia’s existing intellectual property regime and will not require any changes to Australia’s legislation. Minor regulatory changes relating to encoded broadcasts {{will be required to}} extend to Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand the benefits in Part VAA of the Copyright Act 1968 that Australia already extends to parties to the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations 1961 (the Rome Convention). The TPP does not require an increase in the term of copyright protection in Australia, nor any other changes to Australia’s copyright regime, including with respect to technological protection measures. The TPP standard with respect to ISPs is consistent with Australia’s existing ISP liability regime and will not require ISPs to monitor, report or penalise copyright infringement. " However, such an assertion is not well-founded. A close examination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership reveals that the agreement has obligations above and beyond existing agreements – such as the TRIPS Agreement 1994 and the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004. Recommendation 1 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership distorts the aims, objectives, and principles of copyright law. The agreement privileges a corporatist view of copyright law, and seeks to enhance the rights and remedies of copyright owners. The trade agreement is unbalanced. There is a failure to properly represent the traditional objectives of copyright law in promoting learning, access to knowledge, and scientific progress. Moreover, the Trans-Pacific Partnership does not promote copyright goals – such as creativity, innovation, competition, and access to goods and services. Recommendation 2 - The copyright term extension in the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have significant economic, cultural, and innovation costs for Australia and other countries in the Pacific Rim. The Productivity Commission rightly highlights public policy problems in respect of long copyright terms and orphan works. Australia needs to develop law reform solutions for such problems. Recommendation 3 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership has vague, ambiguous and complex language on copyright exceptions and limitations. While the United States enjoys a broad and flexible defence of fair use, many other Pacific Rim countries lack such expansive copyright exceptions. The Productivity Commission makes a strong case about why Australia should adopt a defence of fair use to promote innovation, competition, and consumer welfare. Recommendation 4 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership has detailed, prescriptive text on intermediary liability and copyright law. It is questionable whether this anachronistic model is appropriate and well-adapted for Australia in the digital age. Recommendation 5 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership seeks to lock in United States-style provisions in respect of technological protection measures. This is unwise – given concerns about the efficacy of the regime; the collateral impact of uber-copyright on a range of other public policy interests; and the current constitutional challenge to the technological protection measures regime in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US). Recommendation 6 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership also seeks to embed a United States-style regime in relation to <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> <b>management</b> information. Again, such an approach is questionable – given that such measures have proven to have little utility. Recommendation 7 - The Trans-Pacific Partnership provides for an arsenal of copyright enforcement measures – relating to civil remedies, criminal offences, border measures, government computer software, satellite piracy, and law enforcement co-operation. There has been significant about whether such measures are balanced and proportionate. Moreover, there have been larger concerns {{about the impact of the}} Trans-Pacific Partnership upon due process, privacy, civil liberties, freedom of speech, and human rights. Recommendation 8 - Other Chapters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership – dealing with Investment, and Electronic Commerce – reinforce and exacerbate a number of the problems with the Intellectual Property Chapter. Providing copyright owners with a super-remedy of Investor-State Dispute Settlement is a startling, radical new power. Recommendation 9 - Furthermore, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will result in greater fragmentation of international regulation and governance of copyright law and electronic commerce. The regional agreement will dilute the key role of international organisations such as the World Intellectual Property Organization, and the World Trade Organization. There will also be complications over the relationship between Australia’s bilateral copyright obligations, and the proposed new regional agreement. A copyright trade dispute, for instance, between Australia and the United States could be played out in state-state dispute settlement under the World Trade Organization, the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement 2004, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and investor-state dispute settlement...|$|E

40|$|The modern {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) have been premised on basic principles represented in granting the creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services certain time-limited rights to control the use made of their products, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The term '{{intellectual property}}' denotes copyright and rights relating to it and industrial property. Generally, copyright includes the rights of authors in their scientific and artistic works and the rights relating to them, such as the rights of producers, performance, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations in their performances, phonograms and broadcasts respectively. Industrial property includes patents, utility models, trademarks and service marks, trade names, industrial designs and integrated circuits, geographic indications, trade secrets, and the protection against unfair competition. IPRs have acquired increasing importance because they have become {{a major source of}} wealth, especially for developed countries, which are experiencing great economic transformations. The economies of developed countries have become knowledge-based economies, instead of the traditional industries. Moreover, the emergence of technologies such as the 44 Internet and electronic commerce, have brought further transformations in the field of IPRs. The Internet has facilitated the easy and perfect copying and transfer of intellectual property products worldwide, hence posing direct threat for their protection. On the other hand, the use of technical measures for the protection of IPRs threatens the lawful exploitation of these rights by the society members. This thesis discusses the international protection of {{intellectual property rights}} {{in the light of the}} expansion of electronic commerce. It contains ten chapters deal respectively with the historical development of the intellectual property law, the nature, purpose and scope of modern intellectual property rights, the challenge of the Internet, the regulation of electronic commerce, the conflict of laws implications for electronic commerce and intellectual property, the protection of copyright, trademarks and patens on digital networks and the impact of internationally harmonized IPRs on developing countries, in addition to a conclusion and proposals for reform. Chapter 1 discusses the historical development of the intellectual property law. It is divided into four parts. Part 1 traces the earliest stages of development of intellectual property rights, including prehistory forms of intellectual property rights, forms of intellectual property in the Greco-Roman Era, the Middle Ages and the 45 Mercantilist Period. Part 2 discusses the emergence of modern intellectual property law. Part 3 reviews the traditional legal system governing intellectual property rights. Part 4 examines the internationalization of intellectual property rights. It is divided into four subtitles including a background, the role of TRIPS in the international protection of intellectual property rights and beyond TRIPS developments. Beyond TRIPS developments include multilateral and bilateral treaties, regional instruments, and other developments. Also this Part discusses the role of litigation in the creation of new international intellectual property norms, whereby it reviews the views supporting national courts, WTO Panels, and Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanism. Chapter 2 studies the nature, purpose and scope of modern intellectual property rights. It is divided into four parts. Part 1 defines the term 'intellectual property' and enumerates the main categories of intellectual property rights and how new rights are created. Part 2 studies in brief copyright and neighboring rights. It is divided into four subtitles which examine copyright and neighboring rights, scope of protection, and exceptions and limitations. Part 3 reviews the industrial property rights. It is divided into seven subtitles which discuss the different aspects of the industrial property rights including patents, utility models, trademarks and service marks, trade names, 46 industrial designs and integrated circuits, and geographical indications, in addition to protection against unfair competition and trade secrets. Part 4 examines the justifications for, and, against intellectual property. Chapter 3 studies the phenomenon of the Internet, its potential evolution and expansion, its impact on the international society and the approaches for its regulation. It is divided into three parts. Part 1 studies the emergence of the Internet, and its evolution and potential expansion. It includes the definition of the term Internet and other related terms, how it works and its potential evolution and expansion. Part 2 discusses the positive and negative aspects of the Internet. Part 3 examines the approaches advanced for the regulation of the Internet. It discusses four approaches relating to the governance of the Internet viz., self-governace approach, regulation by means of the traditional legal system, governance through the control of the architecture of the Internet and a hybrid regulation approach. Chapter 4 examines some of the legal aspects relating to the regulation of electronic commerce. It is divided into six main parts. Part 1 discusses the opportunities and challenges of electronic commerce. It is sub-divided into three sub-titles including the definition of the term electronic commerce, its potential growth and the impediments confronting its future growth and expansion. Part 2 47 studies the theoretical approaches advanced for the regulation of electronic commerce. It is sub-divided into four sub-titles which discuss the different suggested approaches. Part 3 studies the formation of electronic contracts. It is sub-divided into five sub-titles involving the definition of the related terms and the discussion of the necessary elements for the formation of contracts such as offer, acceptance, consideration and intention to create legal relations. Part 4 examines the validity of electronic contracts in the light of the formalities required by law. It is sub-divided into three sub-titles, which discuss some of the formalities frequently required by law in paper-based environment and whether these formalities can be satisfied by a data message. Part 5 discusses the authentication of electronic documents. It is sub-divided into two sub-titles including the definition of related terms and a review of the approaches concerning the methods of authentication of electronic documents. Part 6 discusses the admissibility and the evidential value of electronic documents. It is sub-divided into two sub-titles discussing the admissibility of electronic documents as evidence and the weight accorded to such evidence. Chapter 5 studies the conflict of laws implications for electronic commerce. It is divided into three main parts. Part 1 deals with issues relating to jurisdiction. It is subdivided into two main subtitles which 48 discuss the general jurisdiction of courts, which is based on the domicile of the defendant, and the various cases of specific jurisdiction including jurisdiction on tortious acts, choice of jurisdiction, jurisdiction where there is no choice and jurisdiction on disputes involving consumers. Part 2 discusses the governing law. It is divided into four subtitles which study the applicable law where there is choice of law and where there is no choice and the limitations on the choice of law, in addition to the study of the law applicable for infringements cases. Part 3 discusses the enforcement of rights. It is divided into four subtitles which study the need for effective enforcement in the Internet era, the difficulties relating to detection of infringements and identification of wrongdoers, the insufficiency of the traditional means of enforcement and the attempts made to date in relation to enforcement including technical devices, alternative disputes resolution and direct enforcement. Chapter 6 discusses the impacts of electronic commerce on the international protection of copyright and related rights and whether the existing legal system can be adjusted to respond to this technological challenge effectively and efficiently, so as to safeguard the furtherance of the guiding principles of copyright and related rights. It is divided into three main parts. Part 1 studies the scope of the rights of authors on digital networks. It is divided into two subtitles discussing the 49 exclusive economic rights and moral rights of authors. Part 2 studies the protection of copyright and related rights works disseminated over digital networks. It is divided into four subtitles which discuss the infringement of copyright and the related rights and the legal status of the Internet Service Providers, the private international law aspects of copyright and related rights, the protection of copyright and related rights through technical measures and the legal protection of such technical measures. Part 3 examines the future of the traditional copyright exceptions and limitations on digital networks. It is divided into two subtitles which study the scope of the traditional exceptions and limitations and the impacts of the <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> <b>management</b> systems on those exceptions and limitations. Chapter 7 discusses the current problems facing the protection of trademarks rights on digital networks. It is divided into three main parts. Part 1 studies the registration of trademarks as domain names. This part is sub-divided into six titles comprising the definition of domain names, the problems generated by the registration of trademarks as domain names, the role of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the recent developments relating to domain names, the future of ICANN, and the settlement of disputes between domain names holders and trademarks owners. Part 2 discusses other forms of practices on the Internet that proved to be 50 detrimental to trademarks rights. This part is sub-divided into five titles dealing with the use of trademarks as meta tags or keywords or in framing and linking, pop-up advertisements, and mouse-trapping. Part 3 clarifies the clash between the principle of territoriality, upon which the traditional trademark law has been based and the global nature of the Internet. It is divided into four subtitles which discuss the requirement of ‘use’ for the acquisition and maintenance of trademarks rights on the Internet, the co-existence of trademarks on digital networks, jurisdiction over infringements online and the extent of remedies in infringement actions. Chapter 8 discusses the protection of patent rights on the digital networks. It is divided into six parts. Part 1 discusses the patentability of electronic commerce-related inventions. It is divided into two subtitles, which study the patentability of software and business methods. Part 2 discusses the different views in favor of, and, against patenting business methods and software. Part 3 studies some views advanced for dealing with electronic commerce-related inventions. It is sub-divided into two titles discussing the various suggestions. Part 4 discusses the impact of the narrow application of the doctrine of equivalents on the scope of business methods patents. Part 5 examines the scope of prior art for electronic commerce-related inventions. Part 6 studies some private international law issues relating to patents law. 51 It is divided into three subtitles discussing jurisdiction, applicable law, and recognition and enforcement of judgments. Chapter 9 discusses the potential of electronic commerce for developing countries and the ongoing move towards internationally harmonized intellectual property rights, their implications for developing countries and the strategic policies that should be adopted by developing countries to face any accompanying challenges. The chapter is divided into four main parts. Part 1 reviews the potential of electronic commerce for developing countries. It is divided into two subtitles discussing the opportunities and challenges in this respect. Part 2 reviews the different arguments for, and, against the move towards internationally harmonized intellectual property rights. It includes two subtitles which discuss the arguments of the supporters and opponents of internationalization. Part 3 examines the implications of strengthened IPRs for developing countries. It is divided into two subtitles discussing the costs and benefits of strong IPRs in relation to development generally and access to the Internet and electronic commerce in particular. Part 4 discusses strategic policy issues for developing countries. It is divided into four subtitles examining the technical and capacity gaps in developing countries and the necessary safeguards for developing countries in order to fill these gaps. It identifies gaps in four areas need to be filled by developing 52 countries viz., understanding the concepts, issues, benefits and risks of intellectual property protection; implementing and complying with existing commitments; managing and influencing on-going negotiations on further commitments; and making and developing strategies and setting the agenda for the future. Chapter 10 is a conclusion and proposals for reform. The conclusion summarizes the previous chapters. The proposals for reform recommend for the conclusion of an international agreement in order to solve the problems relating to conflict of laws, which have been exacerbated by the emergence of the Internet. However, as far as intellectual property is concerned, the success in concluding such an agreement depends on international agreement on related issues such as the regulation of the Internet and the adoption of acceptable substantive intellectual property rights. In this respect this Study recommends for collective administration of the Internet under the auspices of the United Nations. Moreover, a successful international agreement on substantive intellectual property rights necessitates the removal or lessening of the conflict of interests of the stakeholders. This, in turn, requires the increase of development rates for developing countries, through different means including direct financial support, transfer of technology, encouragement of direct foreign investment, and adoption of intellectual property laws 53 conducive to innovation and competition. Developed countries should not exercise pressures on developing countries and should stop the ongoing campaign for imposing on developing countries intellectual property laws not acceptable by them. They should, instead, provide developing countries with the financial and technical support they need and work with them to achieve the common interests of all partie...|$|E

However, many brokerage and e-commerce platforms currently in operation were not originally designed to support contract and <b>rights</b> <b>management.</b> In this context, we identify open issues in digital contract and <b>rights</b> <b>management</b> and present a framework design to resolve these issues. This framework uses standardized XMLbased rights expression languages, reuses an existing role-based access control component for rights enforcement, and is extensible with valueadded service components for <b>rights</b> <b>management.</b> The reference project for our work is a (heterogeneous) P 2 P network of interacting brokerage platforms for learning resources. 1...|$|R

This dissertation focuses upon realizingfair {{electronic commerce}} for mobile environments such as mobile phone systems; itintroduces protocols and a communication framework {{to implement a}} feasible commerceinfrastructure that allows users to efficiently and fairly trade diverse valuable items suchas <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> and digital contents, by effectively using personal tamper-resistantdevices such as UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) smartcards, a common adjunctto 3 rd-generation mobile phones. To make various valuable items including money, tickets, and coupons uniformly tradable,this dissertation introduces the notion of <b>electronic</b> <b>rights,</b> which are the electronicrepresentation of rights to claim some goods or services, and presents a copy preventionscheme to securely realize transferable <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> and an optimistic fair exchangeprotocol that enables users to trade such <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> fairly and efficiently. Next, anoptimistic fair exchange method based on solving the non-blocking atomic commitment(NBAC) problem is presented to extend the range of tradable items from electronic rightsto arbitrary items including digital contents without sacrificing efficiency. To providea formal proof of the security of such agreement-based fairness, the construction of anideal functionality equivalent to NBAC in the universal composability framework anda formal proof of their equivalence are presented. Finally, a communication frameworkfor the efficient implementation of inter-smartcard distributed protocols is presented. Aprototype system implementing the fair exchange protocol for trading <b>electronic</b> <b>rights</b> onthis framework is evaluated and the results confirm feasibility of the protocol and meritsof the framework. It shows that a feasible mobile electronic commerce infrastructure canbe realized by applying the approaches presented in this dissertation. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
