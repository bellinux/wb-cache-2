5|$|To aid with {{navigation}} and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These {{provide information on}} the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|Argus {{was laid}} down in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in Dalmuir, as the Conte Rosso. She was renamed after her {{purchase}} in September 1916 and was launched on 2 December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918. Formally named after Argus of the 100 <b>Eyes</b> <b>from</b> Greek mythology, Argus was nicknamed the Hat Box or the Flatiron due to her flat-topped appearance.|$|E
5|$|As the Moroccan {{facility}} was one node {{in a wider}} network, Bond and Swann return to London where they meet M, Bill Tanner, Q, and Moneypenny {{with the intention of}} arresting C and stopping Nine <b>Eyes</b> <b>from</b> being activated. Swann and Bond are abducted separately, {{while the rest of the}} group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine <b>Eyes</b> <b>from</b> going online, a brief struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Meanwhile, Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, which is scheduled for demolition after Raoul Silva's bombing. Moving throughout a ruined labyrinth, he encounters a disfigured Blofeld, who tells him that he has a choice between escaping the building before explosives are detonated or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and the two escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. As Blofeld crawls away from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann.|$|E

5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or his <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, {{and the next year}} sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|This game's {{challenge}} mode {{is called}} the Challenge of the Titans (seven trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., kill all enemies without being attacked). The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards, as well as usage of the abilities found in the urns during the first playthrough. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards, as does collecting twenty <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> defeated cyclopes. A new mode, called Arena of the Fates, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents to improve their skills.|$|E

25|$|Protective eyewear is {{beneficial}} to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Since light {{can reach the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the sides, full-coverage eye protection is usually warranted {{if there is an}} increased risk of exposure, as in high-altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher-than-ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Iowan is the {{newspaper}} of The University of Northern Iowa. It is published semi-weekly, on Tuesday and Friday and distributed around campus free of charge. The {{name of the}} paper {{has changed over the}} years. It was called the Students Offering from 1888-1889, the Normal <b>Eye</b> <b>from</b> 1892-1911, the College <b>Eye</b> <b>from</b> 1911-1967, and the Northern Iowan from 1967-present.|$|R

25|$|In contrast, Dearborn, Gates, Bennet and Blau {{considered}} a faulty {{guidance of the}} seeing mechanism to be the cause. They sought to discover if a conflict between spontaneous orientation of the scanning action of the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> right to left and training aimed at the acquisition of an opposite direction would allow {{an interpretation of the}} facts observed in the dyslexic disorder and especially of the ability to mirror-read.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} diaries from {{survivors}} {{and hundreds of}} written correspondences made to relations {{from those in the}} ghetto at the time. Photos of many of the ghetto's deportees to Auschwitz were preserved. A collection of over 2,000 photographs was discovered in October, 1986, including many images of life in Będzin and the ghetto. Some of them have been published in a book or in a video. The <b>Eyes</b> <b>from</b> the Ashes Foundation administers the collection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{fracture}} and dislocation, occlusion of blood vessels becomes the major cause of death, rather than asphyxiation. Obstruction of venous drainage of the brain via occlusion of the internal jugular veins leads to cerebral oedema and then cerebral ischemia. The face will typically become engorged and cyanotic (turned blue through lack of oxygen). There will be the classic sign of strangulation, petechiae, little blood marks on the face and in the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> burst blood capillaries. The tongue may protrude.|$|E

25|$|Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still {{unsure of}} the weapon's effectiveness, only issued {{breathing}} masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, {{who was also a}} chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.|$|E
25|$|By {{wearing a}} flat diving mask, humans can see clearly under water. The scuba mask's flat window {{separates}} the <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the surrounding water by {{a layer of}} air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) {{in a manner similar}} to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. Linear polarizing filters decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn Excelsiors was {{the first}} team to wear what would later become the modern {{baseball}} cap, with its distinctive rounded top and peak, in the 1860s. By {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, this style of cap had become common, but some teams occasionally revived the flat-topped cap, such as the New York Giants in 1916 and the Pittsburgh Pirates as recently as during the 1979 World Series. Over time, the peak has enlarged slightly to further protect the player's <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the sun. More recently, players have worn hats with fold-down ear flaps in cold weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum could have imagined. In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E
25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to take his <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
