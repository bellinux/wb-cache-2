40|$|Background & purpose: There are {{occupational}} hazards {{related to}} Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) in hospitals operating and recovery rooms. These hazards include the decrease of mental performance and audio-visual ability, and reduced fertility, spontaneous abortion and neurological, renal and liver diseases. In this survey, {{the concentration of}} Nitrous Oxide in indoor air of hospitals operating and recovery rooms in Babol University of medical sciences was determined. Materials & Methods: This descriptive study was performed in 23 operating rooms and 3 recovery rooms in 3 educational hospitals of Babol medical sciences university. The rooms with continuous usage of N 2 O with 2 - 3 lit/min of flow of general anesthesia were studied. For sampling and detecting N 2 O concentration as part per million (ppm), a portable IR spectrophotometer (3015 model of Bacharach Inc.) was used. The sampling was performed in 5 <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the operating rooms and 1 <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> recovery room in 3 different hours of work time (8 : 30 - 9 AM, 10 : 30 - 11 AM and 12 : 30 - 1 : 00 PM). One-way ANOVA,SPSS 18 was used to analyze data and comparing the means. Results: N 2 O concentration mean in 5 <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the operating rooms was 318 ± 22. 6, 325. 5 ± 24. 1, 299 ± 21. 8, and 301 ± 22, 314 ± 23. 7 ppm and in recovery room, it was 51 ± 15 ppm. There {{was no significant difference}} between the means of N 2 O concentration in <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the operating rooms, but the means of N 2 O concentration in <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the operating rooms and recovery room were significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering high average concentration of Nitrous Oxide in different operating and recovery rooms with maximum contamination levels of N 2 O, this situation subjects the health personnel to risk. Therefore, further research and applying protection utilities are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social WorkRobert SchaefferWorld-system theorist Immanuel Wallerstein {{made two}} {{theoretical}} assertions in Historical Capitalism that (a) significant inequalities in the “margin of safety against…endemic dangers and erratic violence” {{for people in}} <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the world economy persisted {{over long periods of}} time and (b) that the “margin of safety” for people in the periphery has actually deteriorated. This study set out to test this theory by examining mortality data for countries in <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the world-economy. It identified a set of health-related proxies for “endemic dangers and erratic violence”, infectious diseases (malaria, polio, tuberculosis, and influenza), chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular), erratic violence (homicide, suicide, and motor vehicle accidents), and also infant mortality and life expectancy for women and men. It gathered data from the United Nations Statistical Division’s Demographic Yearbook for a select sample <b>of</b> countries in <b>different</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the world-economy (core, semiperiphery, and periphery) from 1950 to 2010, and examined how mortality from these dangers changed during this period. This study found that mortality data for infectious diseases did not provide much support for Wallerstein’s theoretical assertions. But the mortality data for chronic disease and erratic violence provided strong support for Wallerstein’s assertions. The data on life span provided some support for Wallerstein’s first assertion, but not for his second. Overall, the findings generally support Wallerstein’s theories and suggest ways that health-related inequalities might be addressed...|$|R
