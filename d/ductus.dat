5|$|After birth, the <b>ductus</b> arteriosus regresses to {{form the}} ligamentum arteriosum. During growth, these arteries descend into their {{ultimate}} positions in the chest, creating the elongated recurrent paths.|$|E
5|$|Patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus {{also appears}} in the breed. It is a {{condition}} where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth. It can cause complications as it is positioned to allow the blood flow to bypass the lungs. It also appears in American Staffordshire Terriers.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} {{how some}} structures {{are seen to}} be prepared for future function, like the milk-teeth of a baby, ready formed inside the gums at birth. Similarly, the circulation of the foetus is supported by temporary short-circuits with the foramen ovale and the <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, as the lungs are not yet in use for breathing.|$|E
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the <b>ductus</b> arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the <b>ductus</b> reuniens.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the <b>ductus</b> arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} {{are complex}} and {{provide the basis for}} species discrimination in most families and also in family identification. The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures of all insects, {{with a wide variety of}} complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the <b>ductus</b> bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause a baby to become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9â€“25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' <b>ductus</b> arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the heart}} include patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of fallot.|$|E
25|$|Indometacin {{has also}} been used {{clinically}} to delay premature labor, reduce amniotic fluid in polyhydramnios, and to close patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the Wolffian duct persists, and forms {{for example the}} epididymis, the <b>ductus</b> deferens, the {{ejaculatory}} duct, seminal vesicle and efferent ducts.|$|E
25|$|The Mongol script {{has been}} the basis of alphabets for several languages. First, after {{overcoming}} the Uyghur script <b>ductus,</b> it was used for Mongolian itself.|$|E
25|$|Around a 5% {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus in offspring {{has been found to be}} correlated with advanced paternal age. Advanced paternal age has also been linked to increased risk of achondroplasia and Apert syndrome. Offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and the tetralogy of Fallot. It is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices.|$|E
25|$|A <b>ductus</b> would, hopefully, move people, {{intellectually and}} emotionally, through the places {{of a text}} to its end, or its {{intention}} (intentio) to persuade them one way or another.|$|E
25|$|In {{women who}} are pregnant, {{it has been shown}} that use of this {{medication}} can have an effect of the fetal (Baby's) heart possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the <b>Ductus</b> arteriosus; this is rare.|$|E
25|$|Altered, {{turbulent}} blood flow. The {{areas that}} fibrose, clot, or roughen {{as a result}} of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects.|$|E
25|$|Every Pack has a <b>Ductus</b> (a vampire {{of higher}} status and {{experience}} who functions as leader) {{and most have}} a Priest. Priests lead or oversee the rituals of a Pack. There are some universal rituals within the Sabbat, but Packs usually develop their own, {{with a wide variety}} of uses.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{cardiac output}} (CCO) {{is the sum}} of the outputs of the right and left sides of the heart. It is a useful {{measurement}} in fetal circulation, where cardiac outputs {{from both sides of the}} heart work partly in parallel by the foramen ovale and <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, which directly supply the systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|In {{pregnant}} women, ACE inhibitors {{taken during}} all the trimesters {{have been reported}} to cause congenital malformations, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include hypotension, renal dysplasia, anuria/oliguria, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary hypoplasia, patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, and incomplete ossification of the skull. Overall, about half of newborns exposed to ACE inhibitors are adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|Patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus* {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart defect in dogs around the world. It is inherited in toy and miniature Poodles, and seen commonly in German Shepherds, Pomeranians, Bichon Frises, and Malteses. Signs include a continuous heart murmur, bounding (strong) femoral pulse, tachypnea (increased breathing rate), dyspnea (labored breathing), and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Children {{born with}} Edwards {{syndrome}} {{may have some}} or all of these characteristics: kidney malformations, structural heart defects at birth (i.e., ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus), intestines protruding outside the body (omphalocele), esophageal atresia, intellectual disability, developmental delays, growth deficiency, feeding difficulties, breathing difficulties, and arthrogryposis (a muscle disorder that causes multiple joint contractures at birth).|$|E
25|$|The palaeographic {{analysis}} of the letterform indicates an early, archaic date. The script used does not clearly match any local variant of the Greek alphabet: certain letter shapes indicate an origin in Attica or Euboea, while other letters point to the <b>ductus</b> common in western Asia Minor, particularly that of Knidos. Overall, the comparison with other early Greek documents suggests a creation of the text {{in the middle of}} the 6thcentury BC.|$|E
25|$|The testis has {{collateral}} {{blood supply}} from 1. the cremasteric artery (a {{branch of the}} inferior epigastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} external iliac artery), and 2. the artery to the <b>ductus</b> deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). Therefore, if the testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood supplies.|$|E
25|$|Inhaled {{nitric oxide}} is {{contraindicated}} {{in the treatment}} of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the <b>ductus</b> arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.|$|E
25|$|Copy number {{gain in the}} CCDC142 loci, {{including}} 25 other genes, {{showed a}} phenotype of developmental delay and significant developmental or morphological phenotypes. One result with a copy number loss in the CCDC142 loci, including 29 other genes, showed phenotypes of short stature, abnormal face shape, delayed speech and language development, overlapping toe, intrauterine growth retardation, patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, and delayed gross motor development. However, the effect of CCDC142 may have been confounded for these phenotypes since there were also abnormalities in many other genomic sections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the <b>ductus</b> deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the seminal vesicle arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|Though uncommon, {{potentially}} fatal adverse effects are stroke, myocardial infarction, GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylaxis. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased tearing (eyes), edema, pallor, dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency increased liver enzymes, itching and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the <b>ductus</b> arteriosis in an infant {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. The practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage. Platelet function is decreased related {{to the use of}} ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|Congestive heart failure* is {{the result}} of any severe, {{overwhelming}} heart disease that most commonly results in pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), and/or ascites (fluid in the abdomen). It can be caused by the above two diseases, congenital heart defects such as patent <b>ductus</b> arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) disease, or pericardial effusion. Signs depend on which side of the heart is affected. Left-sided heart failure results in rapid and/or difficulty breathing and sometimes coughing from a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Right-sided heart failure results in a large liver (congestion) and build-up of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), uncommonly fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), or, rarely, peripheral edema.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the first}} good {{description}} of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described accurately the vestibule {{in the interior of}} the temporal bone. He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named <b>ductus</b> venosus. He described the omentum, and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views {{of the structure of the}} pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest {{description of the}} anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He did not understand the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh.|$|E
