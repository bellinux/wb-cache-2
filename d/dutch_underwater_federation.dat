40|$|The {{freshwater}} jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii Lankester {{is distributed}} worldwide in temperate, freshwater habitats. However, such a successful, worldwide dispersion of the medusa and its minute, less obvious polyp is unique among the freshwater jellyfish species (Limnomedusae, Olinidiae). Although numerous reports were given shortly after its discovery, the interest did not cease over the years. In {{cooperation with the}} German <b>Underwater</b> <b>Federation</b> (Verband Deutscher Sporttaucher e. V.) additional data of freshwater jellyfish occurrences could be obtained. In combination with previously published discovery reports, these data provide an area- wide observation {{of the distribution of}} freshwater jellyfish within the Federal Republic of Germany, adding 21 to the previously known C. sowerbii locations. Indications are that there is a far more wide spread distribution of the medusa than thought and the potentially even wider distribution of the often times overlooked polyp...|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of the sport is attributed to Marifé Abad, a resident of Zaragoza, Spain who developed it during the years 1998 to 2000.

The first competition was held during 2000 in Zaragoza. It was introduced to CMAS at its general assembly held in Seville, Spain during 2005. During 2007, draft rules of competition were prepared by the Russian <b>Underwater</b> <b>Federation</b> and it was demonstrated at the First World Underwater Games held in Bari, Italy. During 2008, it was made an official CMAS underwater sport at the CMAS General Assembly in Hurghada, Egypt and it was added to the Russian Register of sports. Its peak body, the Sport Diving Commission first officially met at the 2009 CMAS General Assembly in Phuket, Thailand with Marifé Abad as its chair.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} illegal {{excavation}} {{as a threat}} to underwater cultural heritage in the Netherlands. More specifically, it deals with enforcement of legal protection of the <b>Dutch</b> <b>underwater</b> cultural heritage against the destructive effects of illegal excavation, whether by recreational divers or by professional salvors, to shipwrecks and other archaeological remains underwater. It aims to provide an overview of the enforcement practices currently in operation under the 1988 Monuments and Historical Buildings Act in the inner waters, the terrestrial sea and the contiguous zone of the Netherlands. As a result, Article 45 of the Act, providing a prohibition on illegal excavation, plays a key role. Furthermore, it aims to provide suggestions for improvement of the current enforcement mechanism in a time of turbulent developments within the underwater domain. This is established by means of an analysis of available literature and interviews with governmental stakeholder organizations which are involved in the protection of underwater cultural heritage in daily practice...|$|R
