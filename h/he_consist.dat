30|$|Ser 57 is {{positioned}} for nucleophilic {{attack on the}} carbonyl carbon of the 9 -O-Ac-Neu 5 Ac group. The carbonyl oxygen of the substrate points into an ‘oxyanion hole’ formed by the side chain of Asn 117 and the NH -groups of Gly 85 and Ser 57 (Rosenthal et al., 1998). Arg 322 of HEF forms two hydrogen bonds with the sialoside carboxylate group (Fig.  8 D). The structure of the esterase site is quite similar between HEF and coronavirus HE. The catalytic triad of <b>HE</b> <b>consists</b> of the same amino acids, i.e. Ser 40, His 329 and Asp 326; Ser 40 also forms an oxyanion hole with the side chains of Gly 75 and the NH group of Asn 104 (Zeng et al., 2008).|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the classical dynamics of two particles moving in harmonic potential wells and {{interacting with the}} same external environment (<b>HE),</b> <b>consisting</b> of N non-interacting chaotic systems. The parameters are set so that when either particle is separately placed {{in contact with the}} environment, a dissipative behavior is observed. When both particles are simultaneously in contact with HE an indirect coupling between them is observed only if the particles are in near resonance. We study the equilibrium properties of the system considering ensemble averages for the case N= 1 and single trajectory dynamics for N large. In both cases, the particles and the environment reach an equilibrium configuration at long times, but only for large N a temperature can be assigned to the system. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
