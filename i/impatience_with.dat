That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E

5|$|Howe's <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> the {{necessity}} for parliamentary debate of his proposals won him few friends, and he was often accused of dictatorial conduct by the Opposition. As the Liberal government entered its third decade, it and Howe {{came to be seen}} as arrogant. The Government's attempt to impose closure in the 1956 Pipeline Debate led to major controversy in the House of Commons. In the 1957 election, Howe's actions and policies were made an issue by Opposition leader John Diefenbaker. Howe faced a serious challenge in his riding, but was expected to make speeches elsewhere as a major Liberal leader. Howe lost his seat in the election, and Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, ending almost 22years of Liberal rule. Howe returned to the private sector, accepting a number of corporate directorships. The former minister died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Edward became king on his father's {{death in}} early 1936. However, he showed <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> court protocol, and caused concern among {{politicians}} by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced {{her first husband}} and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, {{which at the time}} disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{stochastic}} scheduling problem <b>with</b> <b>impatience</b> to the beginning of service. The impatience of a job {{can be seen as a}} due date and a job is considered to be on time if it begins to be processed before its due-date. Processing times and due dates are random variables. Jobs are processed on a single machine with the objective to minimize the expected weighted number of tardy jobs in the class of static list scheduling policies. We derive optimal schedules when processing times and due dates follow different probability distributions. We also study the relation between the problem <b>with</b> <b>impatience</b> to the beginning of service and the problem <b>with</b> <b>impatience</b> to the end of service. Finally, we provide some additional results for the problem <b>with</b> <b>impatience</b> to the end of service...|$|R

25|$|Additional {{causes of}} the Gaelic revival were {{political}} and personal grievances against the Hiberno-Normans, but especially <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> procrastination and the very real horrors that successive famines had brought. Pushed away from the fertile areas, the Irish were forced to eke out a subsistence living on marginal lands, which left them with no safety net during bad harvest years (such as 1271 and 1277) or in a year of famine (virtually the entire period of 1311–1319).|$|E

During meetings with Prince Gortchacow in April 1861, Appleton and Gortchacow concluded Russia would not recognize the Confederacy, however, trade between the two would still remain. Appleton retired for health reasons on June 8, 1861.|$|E

They agitated both politically and violently sometimes resorting to sporadic acts of sabotage. At the forefront of this move was the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), mostly Ndebele, led by Joshua Nkomo. It was shortly joined by the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly Shona, a breakaway group under Ndabaningi Sithole. After {{the collapse of the}} federation in 1963, both ZAPU and ZANU were banned and the majority of their leaders imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, {{like many}} in the South, {{interpreted}} Brown as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate. In 1963, the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration, and showed <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> efforts to end segregation. In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation, thus {{it was necessary to}} take proactive steps to integrate schools. In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education (1969), Judge Frank Johnson’s desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.|$|E
25|$|If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be {{attributed}} to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, in his 1927 book Die Funktion des Orgasmus (published in English in 1980 as Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis) was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined neurosis in terms of blocks to having orgastic potency. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.|$|E

25|$|In the 1973–74 season, City {{refused to}} fulfil their away fixture against Scunthorpe United, which {{resulted}} in Scunthorpe being awarded the two points. City were experiencing severe financial difficulties which had restricted the club to a small squad of players. City then had an injury crisis which left them with only eight registered players that were fit. The Football League refused to postpone the game, despite City explaining {{that they would have}} to field unregistered players in order to fulfil the fixture. As a result, City did not turn up to the game and were fined £5,000 by the League plus a further £1,334 to compensate Scunthorpe and pay for the match officials' expenses. The League's reason for refusing City's request was their <b>impatience</b> <b>with</b> uneconomic clubs and their acceptance that some would go bankrupt. As of July 2015, this remains the only fixture never to be fulfilled in Football League history. Despite this, City managed to finish the season in 10th place.|$|E
