Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, proof-of-concept study, 369 patients with GERD and moderate heartburn lasting &ge;three days/week, a history of response to antacids/acid suppression therapy, and a positive <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> result were randomized to esomeprazole 20 or 40 mg once daily, or to 40 mg twice daily for four weeks. Heartburn symptom relief/resolution was subsequently evaluated. Results: In this study population, no relationship was apparent between esomeprazole dosage and efficacy variables for sustained heartburn resolution (seven days without symptoms) at week 4 (48. 0 %, 44. 0 %, and 41. 4 % for esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, and 40 mg twice daily, respectively). Nocturnal heartburn resolution with esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily showed a numeric improvement trend versus esomeprazole 20 and 40 mg once daily, {{but this was not}} statistically significant. Conclusions: Heartburn resolution rates at four weeks were similar for all esomeprazole dosages and comparable with rates reported previously, suggesting a plateau effect in terms of clinical response to acid suppression with PPI therapy in this population of selected GERD patients.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with GERD are successfully treated with PPIs. One {{of the most}} important issues? in the treatment of GERD is the selection of patients who will respond to the different treatment options. In a prospective study we found that most GERD {{patients with}} typical symptoms seen at the primary care level respond favourably to a one-month empirical medical treatment. Surprisingly, the type of therapy chosen by the GPs in response to the presenting symptoms did not seem to significantly influence outcomes. Risk factors for non-responsiveness were the presence of alarm symptoms, alcohol use and a history of relapse after or lack of response to previous anti-secretory therapy. This observation reinforces the need for early endoscopy in patients with risk factors or alarm symptoms. Most GERD patients will have a relapse after the acute treatment. They can be treated with long-term PPI maintenance or they may undergo a Nissen anti-reflux fundoplication. Reservations regarding the long-term efficacy, side effects and its invasive character render surgery a less than ideal solution. A few years ago, a number of different endoluminal therapies were proposed as alternative long-term approaches to GERD therapy. Now, five years later, it is time to take stock and evaluate the true contribution of these procedures. We investigated in our centre the underlying mechanism of several endoluminal therapies, because if a new endoluminal therapy wants to be effective, it should interfere with the underlying pathophysiology of reflux disease. This will also help us to explain why some of these procedures failed and what an ideal procedure should be. A. LESP The most obvious mechanism of action for endoscopic anti-reflux procedures would be an increase in LES (Lower Esophageal Sphincter) pressure, or a suppression of transient LES relaxations. However basal LES pressures remained unchanged after the Stretta and Endocinch procedures[i], [ii]. In our small experience with the Enteryx procedure, we also found no significant increase in LES pressure. Thus, changes in LES pressure do not seem sufficient to explain symptomatic benefit or improvement in pH monitoring. It is well established that tLESRs are the most important underlying pathophysiological event in mild to moderate GERD. A number of observations suggest that these therapies reduce the occurrence of tLESRs[iii], [iv], [v]. By changing the compliance of the gastro-esophageal region, due to plications, heating with fibrosis, or the presence of implants, the threshold for triggering a transient relaxation could be increased. As radiofrequency energy induces nerve ablation (for example, the use of radiofrequency energy in the treatment of arrhythmias), the Stretta procedure could also interfere with the efferent or afferent nerves responsible for triggering the tLESRs. B. Sensitivity of the distal esophagus Neurolysis could potentially also induce reduced acid sensitivity at the gastro-esophageal junction. The effect on sensitivity before and after an endoluminal procedure was evaluated in two recent studies. Wenzel found after an Endocinch procedure a decrease of the esophageal sensitivity to acid[vi]. To investigate the sensitivity before and after a Stretta® procedure, we performed a Bernstein <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test.</b> Six months after the Stretta® was performed, we found a significant increase in time elapsed before symptom occurrence during HCl infusion, suggesting that radiofrequency energy delivery reduces esophageal acid sensitivity over time 2. It is unclear whether this is related to or contributes to the clinical improvement after the procedure. Whether the change in esophageal acid sensitivity reflects a direct effect on acid sensitive receptors located at sensory nerve endings of the squamous layer or whether this occurs secondary to a reduction in esophageal acid exposure (with restoration of tight junctions and decreased mucosal permeability) remains unclear. Reduction of sensitivity could help to explain some of the discrepancy between symptomatic improvement and the abscence of normalization of pH monitoring. However, it is unclear whether all procedures will equally affect esophageal sensitivity. C. Distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction We investigated the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction before and after a Stretta® procedure in a double-blind randomized cross-over study[vii]. In this study we found a significant difference in distensibility after a sham or a Stretta® procedure. After administration of sildenafil, an esophageal smooth muscle relaxant, GEJ compliance after Stretta® was normalised to pre-Stretta® level, which rules out GEJ fibrosis as an underlying mechanism. Decreased GEJ compliance, which reflects altered LES neuromuscular function, may contribute to the symptomatic benefit by decreasing refluxate volume. Recently it was proven that the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction may contribute to determining the volume and constituents of reflux in GERD. [viii] Heartburn and regurgitation {{are more likely to be}} evoked when the refluxate’s proximal extent is high, and when volume and acid clearance are delayed. Symptomatic acid reflux episodes have a higher proximal extent and a longer clearance time, suggestive of a higher refluxate volume[ix]. By reducing the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction, the volume of the refluxate will be lower and the probability to be symptomatic higher. Small volumes of reflux will be picked up by a pH probe but will not cause symptoms. Thus, the Stretta® procedure could selectively decrease the more symptomatic large volume episodes, while distal esophageal acid exposure measured with a pH probe may not change substantially. Through such a mechanism, reduction of distensibility could help to explain the discrepancy between symptomatic improvement and lack of normalization of pH monitoring. D. Impedance Esophageal impedance monitoring and pH-monitoring were used concomitantly to evaluate the influence on all types of reflux episodes and their proximal extent after the Endocinch procedure. We found a clear improvement in reflux time (p< 0. 001) after endoscopic gastroplication, nearly normalizing to 1. 2 %. However, pH monitoring showed a significant reduction of pathologic acid reflux but not a normalization. The study showed a reduction of liquid and acid reflux episodes. Esophageal volume clearance was slightly improved and the total number of proximal reflux episodes was reduced. The last two observations indicate that the volume and proximal extent of the refluxate are reduced after the Endocinch® procedure. The reduction in the number of reflux episodes reaching the proximal esophagus after endoscopic gastroplication observed in the present study can help to clarify some of the discrepancy in the degree of improvement between symptoms and acid reflux parameters, because proximal esophageal extent of gastric acid is a main determinant of reflux perception, irrespective of acid exposure time of the distal esophageal mucosa[x]. E. Placebo effect One could argue that the results obtained by these procedures are a striking illustration of a placebo effect, where symptoms improve and objective parameters like pH monitoring hardly improve. However, in a sham controlled trial we found a significant symptomatic benefit in favor of the Stretta® procedure 4. Several other sham controlled randomised studies in the literature also showed significant clinical benefit for the Stretta®, Endocinch® and Enteryx® procedures[xi], [xii], [xiii]. The question remains how well these randomised studies were really blinded for the patients. The three active procedures are followed by more adverse events, such as shoulder pain or chest pain, compared to the respective sham groups. Such differential side effect profile may cause a partial unblinding if the patients are able to distinguish whether they had an active procedure or sham procedure. Through such unblinding, the placebo effect which was supposed to be eliminated by the double-blind sham control, could potentially be re-introduced. An ideal endoluminal anti-reflux procedure should also be effective at the long-term. We evaluated the effect of Endocinch® and Stretta® procedure 3 to 5 years after the intervention. This long-term follow-up showed a significant improvement of symptoms compared to pre-treatment status, although most of the patients are still taking PPIs on a regular basis. However, these results are insufficient to promote these endoluminal therapies in daily clinical practice. First of all, these data are uncontrolled and the natural history of GERD poorly responding to PPI’s after 3 to 5 years is unknown. Moreover, the procedures are relatively costly, not devoid of side-effects, and only effective in a unidentifiable subgroup of patients. Unfortunately, our experience seems to indicate that the other alternative, surgery, is also far from ideal in the group of patients with persisting symptoms despite an Endocinch® or Stretta® procedure. Symptoms were not significantly better in those we referred for surgery, and most of these patients continued to take PPIs. Our studies have identified two other mechanisms that may contribute to symptomatic benefit of endoscopic anti-reflux procedures. The first is a decreased distensibility of the LES, which may reduce the volume and proximal extent of reflux events. The other is a decreased sensitivity of the distal esophagus, although the exact underlying mechanism remains to be identified. Research in novel medical and endoscopic approaches to GERD is ongoing at full speed, and hopefully some of these research lines will lead to solutions that can address some of the unmet needs in current GERD therapy.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that radiofrequency energy delivery at the gastroesophageal junction (the Stretta procedure) induces symptom relief in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), although improvement of acid exposure on pH monitoring was usually limited. A role for decreased esophageal sensitivity has been suggested. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of Stretta on symptoms, acid exposure, and sensitivity to <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> in GERD. Thirteen patients with established proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -dependent GERD (three males; mean age, 51 +/- 10 years) participated in the study. Before and 6 months after the procedure symptom score, pH monitoring and Bernstein <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> were performed. The latter was done by infusing HCl (pH 0. 1) at a rate of 6 ml/min 15 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction for a maximum of 30 min or until the patients experienced heartburn. Results were compared by Student's t-test. Stretta procedure time was 51 +/- 4 min and no complications occurred. After 6 months, the symptom score was significantly improved (12. 5 +/- 2. 0 to 7. 5 +/- 2. 1; P< 0. 05), seven patients no longer needed daily PPI, and acid exposure was significantly decreased (11. 6 %+/- 1. 6 % to 8. 5 %+/- 1. 8 % of time pH< 4; P< 0. 05). The time needed to induce heartburn during <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> decreased from 9. 5 +/- 2. 3 to 18. 1 +/- 3. 4 min (P= 0. 01), and five patients became insensitive to 30 -min <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion,</b> versus none at baseline (P= 0. 04). In conclusion, the Stretta procedure induces subjective improvement of GERD symptoms and decreases <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure.

In 20 patients with asthma and GERD disease, esophageal pH was monitored with a pH meter and bronchial responsiveness was evaluated by aerosol inhalation of bradykinin during <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> and, 24 h earlier or later the patients were submitted to another bronchial provocation test without acid infusion.

40|$|The Bernstein {{test has}} been used as a test of {{oesophageal}} acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50 % temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100 % sensitivity, 73 % specificity, and 81 % accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux. All 10 patients with symptomatic reflux during pH monitoring had evidence of mucosal acid sensitivity. A negative <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> made symptomatic reflux unlikely. However, symptomatic reflux or a positive <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test,</b> or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease. The Bernstein test is simple, safe, and easily performed. A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} fibreoptic {{endoscopy}} have been assessed retrospectively in 71 patients referred for {{consideration of the}} oesophagus as the possible or probable cause of their symptoms.

The combination of radiological reflux and endoscopic abnormality [...] that is, true reflux oesophagitis [...] was seen in only a third of the patients with typical symptoms though much less commonly in those with atypical symptoms.

Our aim {{in this study was}} to determine the effect of prior, unperceived <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure on cortical activity associated with swallowing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques monitored brain activity associated with volitional swallowing before and after subliminal <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> stimulation. Studies were carried out in two phases. In phase I (15 healthy, right-handed subjects, age 21 – 49 yr, 7 female) using whole brain imaging, we documented the potentiating effects of esophageal acidification alone on swallow-related cortical activity. In phase II (10 healthy, right-handed subjects, age 20 – 54 yr, 5 female) using high-resolution fMRI, we measured swallow-induced regional brain activity within the cortical swallowing network before and after esophageal acidification. Unlike the phase I studies, we also tested the effect of saline perfusion alone on the cortical swallowing network in the phase II studies. Because of constraints imposed by high-resolution MRI for region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, we studied only the left hemisphere in this phase.

40|$|BackgroundPatients with {{functional}} heartburn (FH) experience troublesome heartburn that is {{not related}} to gastroesophageal reflux. The etiology of the heartburn sensation in FH patients is unknown. In patients with reflux disease, esophageal hypersensitivity seems associated with impaired mucosal integrity. We aimed to determine esophageal sensitivity and mucosal integrity in FH and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients. MethodsIn this prospective experimental study, we performed an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and upper endoscopy with biopsies in 12 patients with NERD and nine patients with FH. Mucosal integrity was measured during endoscopy using electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and biopsy specimens were analyzed in Ussing chambers for transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial permeability. Key ResultsLag time to heartburn perception was significantly longer in FH patients (median 12 min) than in NERD patients (median 3 min). Once perceived, intensity of heartburn was scored equal with median visual analog scale 6. 5 and 7. 1 respectively. Esophageal mucosal integrity was also comparable between FH and NERD patients, both in vivo extracellular impedance and ex vivo transepithelial resistance and permeability were similar. Conclusions & InferencesPatients with FH did not show acid hypersensitivity as seen in patients with NERD. However, once perceived, intensity of heartburn is similar. Esophageal mucosal integrity is similar between NERD and FH patients, and is therefore unlikely to be the underlying cause of the observed difference in <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> perceptio...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} tests {{for which a}} diagnostic value {{in the context of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has been claimed. Some of these tests (e. g. the <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test)</b> have become obsolete after the advent of 24 -hour oesophageal pH monitoring. With the latter rest not only can excessive reflux be identified, but also, and more importantly, a temporal relationship can be demonstrated between a patient's symptoms and reflux episodes. Radiographical examination of the oesophagus has largely been replaced by endoscopy, although the use of the former test is still indicated in certain circumstances (e. g. in the differentiation of sliding from paraoesophageal hiatus hernia). In clinical practice, the so-called proton pump inhibitor test has gained considerable popularity.

40|$|Angina-like {{chest pain}} of non-cardiac origin {{is a major}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic problem. The oesophagus is frequently suspected to {{be the cause of}} the chest pain in these patients. However, a positive statement for the oesophageal origin of the pain can only be made when during manometry or pH-monitoring the familiar pain attack appears to be accompanied by reflux, severe motor disorders or a combination of both. Due to the intermittent nature of the pain this is only rarely the case during short-listing conventional examinations. Provocation tests have been used to induce the familiar chest pain. The Bernstein <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and the edrophonium test yield the best results. Prolonged (24 -hour) ambulatory recording of intra-oesophageal pressure and pH to increase the chances of recording chest pain concomitantly with an episode of reflux and/or motor disorders appears to be the most sensitive and also the most physiological test.

40|$|Duodenal lipid intensifies the {{perception}} of <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion.</b> Recently, we showed that genes implicated in lipid absorption were upregulated in the duodenum of fasting gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients.

ApoA-IV may stimulate release of cholecystokinin (CCK), an activator of vagal afferents. This study evaluated putative involvement of abnormal apoA-IV and CCK responses to lipid in GERD.   Ten GERD patients and 10 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent duodenal perfusion with Intralipid 20 %, 2 kcal min(- 1), for 60 min. Symptoms were scored, blood samples collected every 15 min during lipid perfusion and 15 min after discontinuation when duodenal biopsies were taken. Plasma and mucosal concentrations of apoA-IV and CCK and transcript levels of 21 genes implicated in lipid absorption, differentially expressed under fasting conditions, were quantified.   Heartburn (P = 0. 003), abdominal discomfort (P = 0. 037) and nausea (P = 0. 008) only increased significantly during lipid infusion in GERD patients.

Our aim was to study the effect of acid and its suppression, by PPI therapy, on NERD patients with dyspeptic symptoms. Hundred-twenty consecutive patients with reflux-associated symptoms were studied. Sixty-nine of them were selected because they were found to have non-erosive reflux disease during upper GI endoscopy and fulfilled the Rome criteria for functional dyspepsia. A standardized questionnaire, assessing the severity (effect on daily activities, from 0 to 3) of belching, abdominal bloating, early satiety, epigastric pain and burning, nausea, vomiting and postprandial fullness, and an esophagogastric 24 hr pHmetry were performed before and at 4 th week therapy with esomeprazole 20 mg bid. Intragastric acid inhibition was evaluated as the % of pH > 3 and symptoms improvement was considered effective if a reduction of dyspepsia severity score (at least 50 %) respect to baseline was obtained. <b>Esophageal</b> basal <b>acid</b> exposure (pH 4 %) was pathological in 44 pts, whereas it was normal in 25. No significant difference was observed in the prevalence and the severity of individual dyspeptic symptoms. At baseline the intragastric % pH > 3 was similar in subjects with normal and abnormal acid exposure (19 ± 3. 8 vs 18 ± 4. 5, p=NS). During esomeprazole therapy, reflux-associated symptoms improved in the majority of patients, but 7 / 69 patients had persistent pathological <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure.

Dyspepsia improvement was present in a higher number of patients with abnormal than in those with normal basal acid exposure (31 / 44 vs 11 / 25, respectively, p 3, p< 0. 05). Our findings confirm that functional dyspepsia may coexist in patients with non-erosive reflux disease.

The 24 hour pH and pressure recording correlated spontaneous chest pain attacks with abnormal motility or gastro-oesophageal reflux in 19 patients (38 %). Fourteen of these patients also had at least one positive provocation test.

However, she did not complain any reflux symptoms, and the score by the frequency scale for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease 1 was 0, thus she was diagnosed as “asymptomatic esophagitis (AE) ”. 2 An <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed and analyzed according to Fass’s method. 3 <b>Acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> sensitivity score (APSS) was calculated from the duration of typical symptom perception (T) and sensory intensity rating {{at the end of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (I) is as follows; APSS = I × T/ 100 (cm × sec/ 100). Her APSS showed zero points because both T and I were 0, which was lower than that of the healthy controls in our hospital (24. 2 ± 24. 0).

40|$|Acid reflux episodes {{that extend}} to the {{proximal}} esophagus {{are more likely to}} be perceived. This suggests that the proximal esophagus is more sensitive to acid than the distal esophagus, which could be caused by impaired mucosal integrity in the proximal esophagus. Our aim was to explore sensitivity to acid and mucosal integrity in different segments of the esophagus. We used a prospective observational study, including 12 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). After stopping acid secretion-inhibiting medication, two procedures were performed: an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and an upper endoscopy with electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and esophageal biopsies. Proximal and distal sensitivity to acid and tissue impedance were measured in vivo, and mucosal permeability and epithelial intercellular spaces at different esophageal levels were measured in vitro. Mean lag time to heartburn perception was much shorter after proximal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (0. 8 min) than after distal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (3. 9 min) (P = 0. 02). Median in vivo tissue impedance was significantly lower in the distal esophagus (4, 563 Ω·m) compared with the proximal esophagus (8, 170 Ω·m) (P = 0. 002). Transepithelial permeability, as measured by the median fluorescein flux was significantly higher in the distal (2, 051 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) than in the proximal segment (368 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) (P = 0. 033). Intercellular space ratio and maximum heartburn intensity were not significantly different between the proximal and distal esophagus. In GERD patients off acid secretion-inhibiting medication, acid exposure in the proximal segment of the esophagus provokes symptoms earlier than acid exposure in the distal esophagus, whereas mucosal integrity is impaired more in the distal esophagus.

40|$|Heartburn is {{the most}} typical symptom in gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). It has been {{suggested}} that heartburn sensation is mediated by the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV 1), a cation channel expressed by sensory neurons and activated by heat, acid pH, capsaicin, lipoxygenase products and anandamide. Exposure of the TRPV 1 receptor to the agonist capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of chilli peppers, is characterized by activation, followed by receptor desensitization. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of intra-esophageal capsaicin instillation on esophageal symptom perception (activation) and on sensitivity to <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (desensitization). Methods: Ten healthy volunteers (4 m, mean age 27  1) were studied on three separate occasions, at least one week apart. During standard esophageal manometry, a 10 ml solution of saline containing 0 (placebo), 0. 5 (low dose) or 3 (high dose) ml of a capsaicin solution (0. 17 mg/ml) were instilled in the mid-esophagus. Thirty minutes later, 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid was infused in the middle third of the esophagus at a rate of 6 ml/min for 30 min. At 5 -minute intervals, throughout the study, the intensity of 10 symptoms (discomfort, pain, retrosternal burning, epigastric burning, fullness, bloating, nausea, belching, satiety, cramps) was assessed on 10 cm visual analog (VAS) scales. Areas under the curve (AUC) for symptom intensities under different conditions were recorded and compared by paired t-test and ANOVA. Results: Instillation of the high dose of capsaicin induced significantly higher symptoms of retrosternal burning and epigastric burning (AUC 203  61 and 155  52 mm*min respectively) compared to the low dose (18  11 and 35  24 mm*min, p< 0. 05) and to placebo (65  40 and 53  43 mm*min, p< 0. 05). High dose of capsaicin also induced more pain (AUC 55  29 vs. 15  15, p< 0. 05) and discomfort (AUC 138  63 vs. 33  30, p= 0. 05) compared to placebo. During <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion,</b> regardless of the time interval of assessment, capsaicin pretreatment did not significantly alter perception scores for retrosternal burning (AUC 1015  254, 1113  217 and 890  243 respectively for placebo, low dose and high dose, NS), epigastric burning (AUC 740  265, 390  239 and 408  207 respectively for placebo, low dose and high dose, NS), or any other symptom.

Although no significant differences in the expression of tight junction proteins were found in biopsies among patient groups, mucosal integrity parameters in reflux patients correlated negatively with the expression of filaggrin.

We hypothesized that BE patients are less sensitive to acid than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients without Barrett {{and that this is}} due to an unusual preservation of mucosal integrity of the squamous epithelium prohibiting transepithelial acid diffusion. Methods: We prospectively analyzed esophageal sensitivity and esophageal mucosal integrity in GERD patients with and without BE and healthy subjects. An <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed and mucosal integrity was assessed in vivo by electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and ex vivo by Ussing chamber experiments with biopsy specimens. Key Results: Gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with BE were less sensitive to acid than GERD patients without BE, but more sensitive to acid than healthy controls (time to perception Barrett's 14. 0 minutes, GERD 4. 6 minutes, controls 17. 5 minutes). However, extracellular impedance (6. 2 and 5. 7 vs 8. 4 x 10 (3) /m) and transepithelial resistance (94. 0 and 89 vs 118 /cm(2)) was similar in BE and GERD patients and significantly lower than in healthy subjects.

Abnormal 24 -h oesophageal pH, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, was found in 19 (19 / 65, 29 %) patients. The percentage of simultaneous contractions was higher and the percentage peristalsis was lower in patients with non-cardiac chest pain when compared with normal subjects by 24 -h ambulatory manometry. Patients with non-cardiac chest pain had a lower SF- 36 score when compared to controls. Conclusions: Typical acid reflux symptoms are uncommon in Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain, but abnormal 24 -h pH results, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, were found in 29 % of patients. Ineffective contractions were more frequently found in patients with non-cardiac chest pain by 24 -h ambulatory manometry, which may have a bearing on the impaired quality of life in such patients.

METHODS: Patients with classic heartburn symptoms were enrolled into the study. Patients were evaluated by a demographics questionnaire and the validated GERD Symptom Checklist. Upper endoscopy was performed to evaluate the presence of esophageal erosions and Barrett's esophagus (BE). Ambulatory pH testing was performed using a commercially available 4 -sensor pH probe with sensors located 5 cm apart. The distal sensor was placed 1 cm above the LES. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients completed the study. Of those, 21 patients had NERD, 20 had erosive esophagitis (EE), and 23 had BE. All patient groups demonstrated greater <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure 1 cm above the LES than 6 cm above the LES. In NERD and EE, this phenomenon was primarily a result of a higher mean percentage of upright time with pH < 4.

Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of LARS vs esomeprazole (20 or 40 mg/d) over 5 years in patients with chronic GERD. Ambulatory intraesophageal and intragastric 24 -hour pH monitoring data were compared between groups before LARS or the start of esomeprazole treatment, and 6 months and 5 years afterward. A secondary aim was to evaluate the association between baseline and 6 -month pH parameters and esomeprazole dose escalation, reappearance of GERD symptoms, and treatment failure over 5 years in patients receiving LARS or esomeprazole. Results: In the LARS group (n = 116), the median 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure was 8. 6 % at baseline and 0. 7 % after 6 months and 5 years (P <. 001 vs baseline).

Patients who required a dose increase to 40 mg/d had more severe supine reflux at baseline, and decreased <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure (P <. 02) and gastric acidity after dose escalation. Esophageal and intragastric pH parameters, off and on therapy, did not predict long-term symptom breakthrough. Conclusions: In a prospective study of patients with chronic GERD, <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> reflux was reduced greatly by LARS or esomeprazole therapy. However, patients receiving LARS had significantly greater reductions in 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure after 6 months and 5 years. Esophageal and gastric pH, off and on therapy, did not predict long-term outcomes of patients. Abnormal supine acid exposure predicted esomeprazole dose escalation. ClinicalTrials.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is {{increased}} in the right compared to the left recumbent position. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure {{is related to the}} acidity at the cardia, but the effect of body position on the acidity at the cardia has not yet been investigated. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying increased <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure in the right recumbent position. METHODS: On 2 separate days a 4 -h combined esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) manometry and pH recording of esophagus, gastric cardia, and corpus was performed in the right and left recumbent position after a high fat meal in 10 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In the right recumbent position a prolonged <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure (7. 0 % vs 2. 0 %, p < 0. 03), a higher incidence of reflux episodes (3. 8 vs 0. 9 /h, p < 0. 03), more transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) (6. 5 vs 3. 2 /h, p < 0. 03), and higher percentage TLESRs associated with reflux (57. 0 % vs 22. 4 % p < 0. 03) was recorded than in the left supine position. Acidity at gastric cardia and corpus was not affected by body position. CONCLUSIONS: Increased <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure in the right recumbent position relative to the left recumbent position {{is the result of a}} higher incidence of GER episodes caused by an increased incidence of TLESRs and higher percentage of TLESRs associated with GER. Body position does not affect the acidity at the gastric cardia and corpu...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux and {{progressive}} esophageal dilatation can develop after gastric banding (GB). HYPOTHESIS: Gastric banding {{may interfere with}} esophageal motility, enhance reflux, or promote esophageal dilatation. DESIGN: Before-after trial in patients undergoing GB. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1999 and August 2002, 43 patients undergoing laparoscopic GB for morbid obesity underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 24 -hour pH monitoring, and stationary esophageal manometry before GB and between 6 and 18 months postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reflux symptoms, endoscopic esophagitis, pressures measured at manometry, <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} the prevalence of reflux symptoms or esophagitis before and after GB. The lower esophageal sphincter was unaffected by surgery, but contractions in the lower esophagus weakened after GB, in correlation with preoperative values. There was a trend toward more postoperative nonspecific motility disorders. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure tended to decrease after GB, with fewer reflux episodes. A few patients developed massive postoperative reflux. There was no clear correlation between preoperative testing and postoperative <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure, although patients with abnormal preoperative acid exposure tended to maintain high values after GB. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative esophageal dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux are not uncommon after GB. Preoperative testing should be done routinely. Low amplitude of contraction in the lower esophagus and increased <b>esophageal</b> <b>acid</b> exposure should be regarded as contraindications to GB. Patients with such findings should be offered an alternative procedure, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass...|$|R
