5000|$|This {{theory was}} also used to {{determine}} <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp),</b> which {{was defined as the}} amount of work a horse could do with a given load over time. The wheel that the horse turned in Watt's original experiment put a certain load on the horse's muscles, and the horse could do a certain amount of work with this load in a minute. Provided the horse was a perfect machine, it would be capable of a constant maximum workload, so increasing the load by a given percentage would result in the possible work done decreasing by the same percentage, so that it would still equal [...] "1 hp". Horses are, obviously, not perfect machines and over short time periods are capable of as much as 14 hp, and over long periods of exertion output an average of less than 1 hp.|$|E
50|$|After {{migrating}} from Scotland in the 1780s, the Murrays established {{themselves as}} manufacturers of textile machinery before moving into spinning fine yarn. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the main market for Murrays' fine spun yarn was the muslin-weaving industry in Scotland; along with McConnel & Kennedy, A & G Murray dominated the Scottish market. In 1790, Adam Murray leased land in Ancoats; {{in partnership with}} his brother George, began construction of his first mill - which was complete by about 1798. The mill was probably designed to house equipment produced by the Murray brothers themselves. First known as Union Mill, from its position on Union Street, the Old Mill was a purpose-built steam-powered spinning mill. Construction took approximately a year and millwright Thomas Lowe - who had worked on Richard Arkwright's first two factories - planned the building. It is eight storeys high and probably the first cotton-spinning factory to have been built that high. The {{first phase of the}} mill, an area of 105 ft by 42 ft, was built of 400,000 locally made bricks. The machinery was powered by a 12 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp),</b> £620 Boulton and Watt steam engine.|$|E

40|$|A set of 10 <b>horse</b> <b>powers</b> (<b>HP)</b> multi-split air {{conditioner}} {{with a digital}} scroll compressor and a standard compressor was designed. The control strategy of compressor switching and the control model of compressor output capacity were presented. The output ratio of the digital compressor was determined in the control strategy. Furthermore, in the control model of compressor output capacity, considering the pressure disturbance, a certain suction pressure range {{was used as the}} pressure control target to adjust the output capacity. Experiments show that the system ran unstably, the standard compressor frequently appeared on off phenomenon, and some operation parameters such as the output ratio of the digital compressor, the opening of electric expansive valve (EEV), the cooling capacity and the air outlet temperature fluctuated. A new control model of the output capacity was proposed, in which the average suction pressure in an adjustment period was taken as the current pressure to regulate the output capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that the control model can be used to solve the frequent on off phenomenon of the standard compressor and oscillation of the operation parameters, realize control accuracy of less than 0. 2 degrees C deviation of the air outlet temperature.

Replacement of conventional IM of higher power rating is done with required energy efficient Doubly Fed Induction Machine (DFIM) to enhance the performance at variable speeds near rated power outputs. Results of the proposed approach will give substantial savings in energy & loss reduction. The field data of Jindal Steel Rolling Mill (JSRM) at Hisar, Haryana (India) is taken into consideration.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the output}} of {{software}} made in Visual Basic, an electromechanical implement lift system with position control was developed to maximize useful power of a low <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp)</b> tractor by replacing hydraulic system requiring higher power. It comprised of two lower links, one top link, two lift rods, one connecting rod and a power screw mechanism. The prototype was tested as per IS: 12224 - 1987 for recommended load of 150 kg on test frame and satisfactory results were found. The response time for lifting a load of maximum lifting capacity on test frame i. e. 116 kg and 110 kg for entire lifting range {{was found to be}} 71 s and 20. 7 s for single start screw and triple start screw, respectively as compared to 44. 7 s and 13. 3 s for lowering the loads. The position control of the system was also tested and found satisfactory with no drop in the height for maximum lifting capacity. The developed system could save 88 % of tractor input power compared to hydraulic system.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} has been to develop and {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a new technology for maintenance engineering: a Just-In-Time Maintenance (JITM) system for rotating machines. The JITM system is based on several key developments at Texas A and M {{over the past ten}} years in emerging intelligent information technologies, which if integrated into a single system could provide a revolutionary approach in the way maintenance is performed. Rotating machines, such as induction motors, range from a few <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp)</b> to several thousand hp in size, and they are widely used in nuclear power plants and in other industries. Forced outages caused by induction motor failures are the reason for as much as 15 % - 40 % of production costs to be attributable to maintenance, whereas plant shutdowns caused by induction motor failures result in daily financial losses to the utility and process industries of $ 1 M or more. The basic components of the JITM system are the available machine sensors, that is electric current sensors and accelerometers, and the computational algorithms used in the analysis and interpretation of the occurring incipient failures. The JITM system can reduce the costs attributable to maintenance by about 40 % and it can lower the maintenance budgets of power and process plants by about 35 %, while requiring no additional sensor installation. As a result, the JITM system can improve the competitiveness of US nuclear utilities at minimal additional cost...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{torque control}} (DTC) {{is one in}} all the {{foremost}} wonderful management methods of torque control of the induction motor. The aim is to regulate effectively the torque and flux. Torque control of associate induction motor (IM) supported DTC strategy is a developed and a comprehensive study which is made during this project. Direct torque management is that the 1 st technology to regulate the important control variables of torque and flux. This methodology makes the rotor more accurate and quick management, high dynamic speed response and easy to regulate. The reference value may be calculated by the flux and torsion estimation and conjointly motor parameters. With the joint progress of numerical electronics and power electronics, it's potential nowadays to subsume the axis management with variable speed in applications involving low power. With these projections of technology, various command approaches are developed by the scientists to master in real time, the torque and also the flux of the electrical ac machines, the direct torque control (DTC) theme being one in all the foremost recent steps during this direction. This theme provides excellent regulation properties without using rotational speed feedback. During this control theme the electro- magnetic torque and mechanical device (stator) flux magnitude are calculable with solely mechanical device voltages and currents and this estimation doesn't rely upon motor parameters apart from the mechanical device (stator) resistance. In this thesis, typical DTC theme has been delineated. The induction motor (IM) has been simulated in stationary d-q arrangement and its free running acceleration characteristics are drawn.

Using a matched-pair comparison of villages in northern Benin, and household survey and field-level data they reported that solar-powered drip irrigation significantly augmented both household income and nutritional intake, particularly during the dry season. Group for rural infrastructure development Nepal (GRID Nepal) initiated PV water pumping project at Bhujikot provided by Nepal development marketplace for supplying drinking and agriculture water to the rural people. The feedback from the community people was very encouraging and they were very happy with the successful work. Solar pump provided their fresh drinking water and increased agricultural production thus improving and upgrading the life style of the community people [8]. Zieroth [9] {{conducted a}} feasibility study on water supply by solar pump in Mauke, Cook Island. The solar project showed a good performance in comparison with diesel-powered pump. Cost of solar pump use was US$ 0.16 per m 3 as compared to US$ 0.22 per m 3 for the diesel-powered pump. At the discount rate of 10  % the net benefits of solar savings were equal to an economic rate of return of 31.5  %, i.e., the solar project was quite economic. In 1999 and 2000, cabbage and peppers, respectively, were grown comparing solar and conventionally powered drip irrigation systems at the Rutgers University Research and Extension Farm, Pittstown. The solar system was operated by a 1.5 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp)</b> motor powered by 18 solar modules. Utilizing the sun’s energy, captured by photovoltaic panels, to power irrigation systems offered a cost-effective, pollution-free and virtually maintenance-free alternative to diesel pumps in remote areas. Solar-powered pumping systems were capable of delivering water from rivers and wells in volumes up to 2, 000 gallons/min [10].|$|E
40|$|Solar Irrigation Pumps (SIPs) {{are used}} to pump (ground and surface) water to irrigate farm lands. In {{a country with a}} {{historical}} mismatch of energy supply and demand, and almost 120 million families dependent on earnings from agriculture (Prachi Salve, 2014), SIPs offer great prospects. Unlike electric and diesel pumps – dominating the market till today – SIPs have almost zero marginal costs. This leads to extra crop production at negligible costs and also generation of electricity when not being used for pumping. Due to almost zero emissions, it simultaneously addresses the issue of climate change hence bringing prosperity to the population at all levels. SIPs are a new phenomenon in India and due to the comparatively 1 high capital costs, SIPs require subsidies to make them affordable for a farmer. Support in the form of subsidies has been given to around 15, 000 farms in the whole country. By introducing solar pumps on a subsidy scheme in 2009 - 2010, Rajasthan has become the pioneer state of India. Since then numerous solar pumps have been deployed and farmers have gained experience with their usage. These farmers appear to be happy with the functioning of the pumps; 95 % of the farmers, who gained enough knowledge to answer the question, say that the pump works better than their diesel or electric pump. A surprising finding is that the project cost per pump is getting higher while the pumps are getting cheaper. This means that the government is using more money to run the project. To find the reasons for the rising project costs and {{to find a way to}} decrease them, further research is needed. If the project cost could be decreased more pumps could be supplied with the same amount of subsidy. It was also found that the SIPs were not successful in replacing the electric and diesel pumps. The diesel and electric pumps had more <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> (<b>hp)</b> so were able to pump more water resulting in irrigation of more land in the same amount of time. Farmers expressed they could fully switch to SIPs when more powerful pumps were supplied. Because the present SIPs are off grid systems, it is not possible to sell the excess electricity that is not needed for pumping water. Because there are no marginal costs, there is no incentive for switching off the machines either. The consequence is excessive pumping of water leading to groundwater depletion. An important improvement would be to connect these pumps to the electricity grid. The possibility to earn some money with delivering energy would probably be a good reason to stop needless pumping. The subsidy program that was in place in Rajasthan had an 86 % capital subsidy (the farmer had to pay only 14 % of the price of SIP). With the available money only 10, 000 pumps per year could be supplied (Dr. Dinesh Kumar Goyal, 2013). When the subsidy per pump is decreased more pumps could be deployed and it was shown that even with a lower subsidy getting a SIP will still be attractive. One of the points of improvement for a quick roll out of SIPs might be found in the way these pumps are financed. Pumps have a high capital cost and are currently financed by 70 - 90 % capital subsidies of the government. The amount of total subsidy is limited and so with a high percentage of subsidy a small amount of pumps are deployed by this subsidy. These subsidies could be dramatically reduced when a loan/lease product would be put in place. Without a bank loan farmers are unable to pay the major part of the capital cost of the pump. Offering a bank loan is a win-win situation for the farmers and the people of India, represented by the government. With these pumps farmers are able to sell electricity to the grid and earn extra income or they can sell water to other farmers for a price below the price of current diesel pumping. With this income they could pay off the loan in 7 years and earn a reasonable income. The people of India will not only benefit by having to pay less for subsidies, they will also benefit from less greenhouse gas emissions as solar has almost zero emissions compared to mainly coal based electricity pumps and diesel pumps. SIPs supplying electricity can have a big effect on grid stability. Hence, in chapter 6 the question of grid stability was raised. Under what conditions can the Indian grid deal with a large amount of electricity injected from SIPs. India currently has 70 % of the electricity produced from coal power plants while 3 % comes from Nuclear power plants (Trading Economics, 2011 a). These sources have a response time of several hours which is not quick enough to respond to fluctuations in the demand of energy by for example households, or a change in production by other sources, for example solar. The present sources should be partly replaced by quick response sources like the renewable sources and gas turbines. Currently 6 % of the installed capacity is a gas power plant (Central Electricity Authority, 2015) but this percentage should be increased. Also other solutions should be implemented, such as developing storage of energy and more interconnections between grids of states and other countries. Since the idea is that SIPs would not use electricity from the grid anymore unlike electric pumps, 25 % of electricity currently used from the grid by agriculture will be less. The current electric pumps only get electricity for certain hours a day and {{are used to}} balance the grid, only at times of low electricity use of other users, farmers will get electricity. When the electric pumps are replaced by SIPs that do not use electricity from the grid the balancing function that the electric pumps currently fulfil will no longer be present. Having no experience with SIPs connected to the grid so far, it will be difficult for the state load dispatch centres, which manage the grid, to schedule the expected load. Hence, pilots should be set up to find out how these pumps are used throughout the day so that in the future these loads can be predicted. In Gujarat the solar installed capacity could easily be a fivefold without having to invest in extra capacity of quick responsive sources, since enough installed capacity of gas turbines is already in place but currently not used. Extra investment would be needed in the grid in order to be able to transmit so much electricity over the grid from the (distributed) solar plants. Solar irrigation pumps, when implemented correctly, can not only lead to much cheaper irrigation for farmers but also less groundwater depletion and a source of extra income. Solar pumps can lead the way to more prosperity for the Indian people, but new guidelines and plans have to be made by the government to realise this potential. Without policy changes as described in this thesis SIPs benefit a small number of lucky farmers at the expense of the larger whole (wasting public money and groundwater) ...|$|E
