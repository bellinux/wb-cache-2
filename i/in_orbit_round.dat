30|$|In situ {{measurement}} of Moon-originating ions picked-up <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the Moon {{is expected to}} provide valuable information regarding the thin lunar atmosphere and surface. Secondary ions sputtered by the solar wind ions reflect the surface abundance. Global composition mapping of the lunar surface may be thus achieved by measuring the sputtered ions as one would perform laboratory SIMS.We studied the dynamics of picked-up lunar ions when the Moon was exposed to the solar wind. Our model’s source mechanism involved photoionization of the lunar exospheric atoms, photon-stimulated ion desorption, and ion sputtering. We propose that an intense flux of picked-up lunar ions (104 /cm 2 sec) exists {{at an altitude of}} 100 km, for nearly a quarter of the orbit. The ion flux originating from the lunar surface is mono-directional and mono-energetic, and is distinguishable from that of lunar atmospheric origin whose energy spectra correspond to their spatial distribution. Our calculation suggested that ion measurements <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the Moon enable remote SIMS analyses.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on access to {{knowledge}} as a human right and instrument to development with particular regard to the pharmaceutical field. In {{the first part of}} this essay, after attempting to define knowledge, the two processes of knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion will be explored. At first sight, access to knowledge seems to gravitate <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> knowledge diffusion. However, because of the osmosis between knowledge creation and knowledge diffusion, access to knowledge in fact plays an essential role in knowledge creation as well. Therefore, the role of access to knowledge in both spheres will be analysed. It will be argued that access to knowledge is a fundamental human right and a key instrument to development. The policy tools to promote access to knowledge will be scrutinized. In particular, both Intellectual Property (IP) and open access models of knowledge creation and diffusion will be considered. In the second part of this essay, the impact of IP on knowledge creation and diffusion will be analysed with regard to the pharmaceutical sector. My conclusion will be that IP is just one method of knowledge governance and other conceptual and legal models are needed to promote fairness and equity in accessing knowledge...|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, the Maine Farmers' Almanac listed blue moon dates for farmers. These {{correspond}} to the third full moon in {{a quarter of the}} year when there were four full moons (normally a quarter year has three full moons). Full moon names were given to each lunation in a season. The seasons used were those of the mean tropical year, equal in length, as opposed to the astronomical seasons which vary in length because the earth's speed <b>in</b> its <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the sun is not uniform.|$|R
50|$|Johannes Kepler {{had proved}} by an {{elaborate}} series of measurements that each planet revolves <b>in</b> an elliptical <b>orbit</b> around the Sun, whose centre occupies {{one of the}} foci of the orbit, that the radius vector of each planet drawn from the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, and that the squares of the periodic times of the planets {{are in the same}} proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. The fact that heavy bodies have always a tendency to fall to the earth, no matter at what height they are placed above the Earth's surface, seems to have led Newton to conjecture that it was possible that the same tendency to fall to the earth was the cause by which the moon was retained <b>in</b> its <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the earth.|$|R
60|$|Mr Godwin {{considers}} man {{too much}} in the light of a being merely intellectual. This error, at least such I conceive it to be, pervades his whole work and mixes itself with all his reasonings. The voluntary actions of men may originate in their opinions, but these opinions will be very differently modified in creatures compounded of a rational faculty and corporal propensities from what they would be in beings wholly intellectual. Mr Godwin, in proving that sound reasoning and truth are capable of being adequately communicated, examines the proposition first practically, and then adds, 'Such is the appearance which this proposition assumes, when examined in a loose and practical view. In strict consideration it will not admit of debate. Man is a rational being, etc.' (Bk. I, ch. 5; in the third edition Vol. I, p. 88). So far from calling this a strict consideration of the subject, I own I should call it the loosest, and most erroneous, way possible, of considering it. It is the calculating the velocity of a falling body in vacuo, and persisting in it, that it would be the same through whatever resisting mediums it might fall. This was not Newton's mode of philosophizing. Very few general propositions are just in application to a particular subject. The moon is not kept <b>in</b> her <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the earth, nor the earth <b>in</b> her <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the sun, by a force that varies merely in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. To make the general theory just in application to the revolutions of these bodies, it was necessary to calculate accurately the disturbing force of the sun upon the moon, and of the moon upon the earth; and till these disturbing forces were properly estimated, actual observations on the motions of these bodies would have proved that the theory was not accurately true.|$|R

For a time he remained crouching, and when at last he looked out again the little town was very small and travelling, with the rest of lower Germany, <b>in</b> a circular <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> and round the car--or at least it appeared to be doing that. When he got used to it, he found this rotation of the balloon rather convenient; it saved moving about in the car.|$|R
60|$|Now in {{virtue of}} its motion <b>in</b> an <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the sun, our earth is {{comparable}} with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space {{with respect to the}} earth. For owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth {{in the course of a}} year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system K[0] throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.|$|R
40|$|We have {{computed}} the Galactic {{trajectories of}} 12 hypervelocity stars (HVSs) {{under the assumption}} that they originated in the Galactic Centre. We show that eight of these 12 stars are bound to the Galaxy. We consider the subsequent trajectories of the bound stars to compute their characteristic orbital period, which is 2 Gyr. All eight bound stars are moving away from the centre of the Galaxy, which implies that the stars' lifetimes are less than 2 Gyr. We thus infer that the observed HVSs are massive main-sequence stars, rather than blue horizontal branch stars. The observations suggest that blue HVSs are ejected from the Galactic Centre roughly every 15 Myr. This is consistent with the observed population of blue stars <b>in</b> extremely tight <b>orbits</b> <b>round</b> the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), the so-called S-stars, if we assume that the HVSs are produced by the breakup of binaries. One of the stars in such a binary is ejected at high velocities to form a HVS; the other remains bound to the SMBH as an S-star. We further show that the one high-velocity system observed to be moving towards the Galactic Centre, SDSS J 172226. 55 + 594155. 9, could not have originated in the Galactic Centre; rather, we identify it as a halo object...|$|R

The machine accelerates 2, 100 tons/yr of external tankage, in 14 -gram segments, to exhaust velocities of 8, 000 - 10, 000 m/s. The resulting reaction force raises 1, 700 tons/yr. of Shuttle payloads to high <b>orbit,</b> <b>in</b> two <b>round</b> trips. Exhaust velocity and thrust can be optimized for each mission segment. For a mission requiring an exhaust velocity of 8, 000 m/sec, thrust is 560 newtons, power is 2. 9 megawatts, and efficiency is 75 %. Total electrical component mass including power supplies and waste-heat radiators is 89 tons.

5000|$|According to the Farmers' Almanac, a [...] "blue moon" [...] is {{the third}} full moon in any period between either {{solstice}} and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the mean tropical year), which contains four full moons. These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed <b>in</b> its elliptical <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the sun. To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT).

60|$|Such {{cases of}} {{sequence}} {{as that of}} day and night not only do not contradict the doctrine which resolves causation into invariable sequence, but are necessarily implied in that doctrine. It is evident, that from {{a limited number of}} unconditional sequences, there will result a much greater number of conditional ones. Certain causes being given, that is, certain antecedents which are unconditionally followed by certain consequents; the mere co-existence of these causes will give rise to an unlimited number of additional uniformities. If two causes exist together, the effects of both will exist together; and if many causes co-exist, these causes (by what we shall term hereafter the intermixture of their laws) will give rise to new effects, accompanying or succeeding one another in some particular order, which order will be invariable while the causes continue to co-exist, but no longer. The motion of the earth <b>in</b> a given <b>orbit</b> <b>round</b> the sun, is a series of changes which follow one another as antecedents and consequents, {{and will continue to do}} so while the sun’s attraction, and the force with which the earth tends to advance in a direct line through space, continue to co-exist in the same quantities as at present. But vary either of these causes, and this particular succession of motions would cease to take place. The series of the earth’s motions, therefore, though a case of sequence invariable within the limits of human experience, is not a case of causation. It is not unconditional.|$|R
