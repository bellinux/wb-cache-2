50|$|Ethisterone is {{described}} as a relatively weak progestogen, similarly to its analogue <b>dimethisterone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{high doses}} of EE {{that were used in}} early COCs were {{associated}} with a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer in certain preparations, for instance those containing the progestogen <b>dimethisterone.</b> Unopposed estrogens like EE have carcinogenic effects in the endometrium and progestogens protect against these effects, but <b>dimethisterone</b> is a relatively weak progestogen and was unable to adequately antagonize the endometrial carcinogenic effects of EE, in turn resulting in the increased risk of endometrial cancer. COCs containing <b>dimethisterone</b> have since been discontinued (with more potent progestogens used instead) and doses of EE in COCs in general have been dramatically reduced, abrogating the risk. In turn, most studies of modern COCs have found a decreased risk of endometrial cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethisterone</b> was {{introduced}} in the United States as an oral contraceptive in combination with high doses of ethinylestradiol under the brand name Oracon (25 mg <b>dimethisterone,</b> 100 μg ethinylestradiol) in 1965. Due {{to the fact that it}} contains a weak progestogen in combination with a large dose of a potent estrogen, this preparation was eventually found to be associated with a substantially increased risk of endometrial cancer in women, and is now no longer marketed.|$|E
50|$|The {{improved}} {{potency of}} <b>dimethisterone</b> due to 6α-methylation reportedly {{served as the}} basis for the synthesis of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Whereas hydroxyprogesterone acetate (the 6α-demethylated analogue of medroxyprogesterone acetate) is around twice as potent as ethisterone orally, medroxyprogesterone acetate shows 10 to 25 times the potency of ethisterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethisterone</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Lutagan, Secrosteron), {{also known}} as 6α,21-dimethylethisterone, is a steroidal {{progestin}} related to ethisterone (17α-ethinyltestosterone). It {{was developed by the}} British pharmaceutical company British Drug Houses (which subsequently merged with Merck KGaA) and was first reported in the medical literature in 1959, with introduction for medical use as Secrosteron following in the same year.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and <b>dimethisterone</b> appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethisterone</b> {{was derived}} from {{modification}} of ethisterone via introduction of methyl groups at the C6α and C21 positions. Relative to ethisterone, it is 12 times as potent orally as a progestogen in animals (Clauberg test), and, unlike ethisterone, is a pure progestogen with no androgenic (or estrogenic) activity in animals even at very high doses (although some weak antimineralocorticoid activity was observed at high doses in animals). However, {{in spite of its}} improved potency over ethisterone, it is a weak progestogen relative to most other progestins, in fact one of the weakest known.|$|E
50|$|Extension of the C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes {{androgenic}} activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen, as in topterone (17α-propyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of ethylestrenol). Conversely, {{replacement of the}} C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish androgenic activity, as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to extension of the C17α alkyl chain, extension of the C17α ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity, as with <b>dimethisterone</b> (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features extension of the C17α chain {{in the form of}} a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
