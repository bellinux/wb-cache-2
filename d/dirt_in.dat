5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
5|$|The last race run on <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> a NASCAR {{national}} touring series {{occurred on}} September 30, 1970, at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in Raleigh in a Grand National (now Sprint Cup Series) race, which was won by Richard Petty. Afterwards, NASCAR sanctioned the Busch All-Star Tour, a dirt late model series, which lasted from 1985 to 2002.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day, May 5, 2012, Shackleford raced in the $400,000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes {{at seven}} furlongs on the <b>dirt.</b> <b>In</b> that race, he beat the favorite, American Champion Sprint Horse Amazombie, by a length. The two horses {{separated}} {{themselves from the}} rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E

5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered with animal skins, grasses, bark, and/or <b>dirt.</b> <b>In</b> the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves or abandoned pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of <b>dirt.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} oviparous, meaning these turtles produce {{offspring}} by laying eggs only {{and do not}} provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas {{in order to avoid}} flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 94 first {{appears on}} the June 1944 state highway map, {{implying}} it was first commissioned sometime during 1943 or {{the first half of}} 1944. At this time, the highway had the same termini and routing as it does today, but was entirely <b>dirt.</b> <b>In</b> 1949, it was upgraded to gravel. In 1956, the road was wholly paved. No further changes other than routine maintenance have occurred since then.|$|E

25|$|SH-27 first {{appears on}} the {{official}} state highway map in its 1948 edition, suggesting that it was created {{at some point in}} 1947. At this time, the route began in the north in Okemah, as it does presently; its southern terminus, however, was at US-75 north of Wetumka. In Hughes County, the highway consisted of gravel, switching to <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> Okfuskee County. The highway existed in this state until 1956, when it was removed from the highway system.|$|E
25|$|The UV lamps {{for water}} {{treatment}} consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a polychromatic output from 200nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; {{it is either}} housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and <b>dirt,</b> <b>in</b> the stream.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem was}} caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> the sliding pits and pitcher's mound so soft that the cutouts {{covering}} them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt hot mix, which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a jackhammer for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year).|$|E

25|$|For all of {{the sound}} common sense that Illingworth had {{demonstrated}} {{as a player and}} reinforced as a commentator, his abrasive man-management style appeared out of date by 1994. Examples of this were his readiness to speak to the media to criticise his own players, as he did twice with Mike Atherton: firstly during the <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> the pockets scandal in 1994 and later the same year during the Melbourne Test match. Illingworth also engaged in a public argument with Devon Malcolm just after Malcolm had produced a rather wayward burst of bowling in the fifth test of the 1995–96 South African series, which saw a long 10th wicket stand that effectively cost England the match.|$|E
25|$|The Boston and Maine Railroad {{tested the}} KarTrak system on their gravel cars in 1961. The tests {{continued}} until 1967, when the Association of American Railroads (AAR) selected it as a standard, Automatic Car Identification, {{across the entire}} North American fleet. The installations began on 10 October 1967. However, the economic downturn and rash of bankruptcies in the industry in the early 1970s greatly slowed the rollout, {{and it was not}} until 1974 that 95% of the fleet was labeled. To add to its woes, the system was found to be easily fooled by <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> certain applications, which greatly affected accuracy. The AAR abandoned the system in the late 1970s, and {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that they introduced a similar system, this time based on radio tags.|$|E
25|$|He first gained {{prominence}} in November 1953 when he tracked down the former Thomas C. Buntin and his wife. The bizarre case involved {{the son of}} a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in the Lone Star state. After a series of dead-ends, Seigenthaler struck pay <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> Orange, Texas, where he saw an elderly man step off a bus. Noting the man's distinctive left ear, Seigenthaler followed him home. After three further days of investigation, {{he went back to the}} home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story.|$|E

25|$|Rosberg won {{the pole}} {{position}} by posting the fastest lap in qualifying under controversial circumstances and maintained his advantage {{going into the}} first corner. The race was neutralised on the first lap with the deployment of the safety car following an accident between Sergio Pérez and Jenson Button, and when the race, restarted Rosberg remained the leader. Adrian Sutil further caused disruption when he crashed his Sauber on lap 24th lap and Rosberg kept the lead after the field made pit stops. He maintained an varying advantage over Hamilton as the two drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Rosberg was instructed to conserve fuel while Hamilton was told he was not required to do so. Hamilton later got <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> his eye in the race's closing stages, allowing Rosberg to pull way and held the lead for the remainder of the race to secure the victory.|$|E
25|$|After running closely behind {{teammate}} Rosberg {{and feeling}} the wind penetrating his visor, Hamilton got some <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> {{his left eye}} on lap 66 and slowed down in the circuit's low-speed turns as a result, allowing Ricciardo to close up to Hamilton. Hülkenberg had heavily worn rear super soft tyres, and by the 69th lap, was caught by McLaren drivers Button and Magnussen. Bianchi {{was told that he}} needed a five-second advantage over Grosjean to negate the time penalty. Five laps later, Button overtook teammate Magnussen on the main straight for sixth, Räikkönen then attempted to do the same around the inside at the Loews hairpin on lap 74 but ran too deep, leaving both himself and Magnussen in the barrier. Both Räikkönen and Magnussen managed to reverse out of the barrier but lost a large amount of time, thus promoting Bianchi to eighth and Grosjean to ninth. Räikkönen had to make a third pit stop for a new front wing and had super soft tyres fitted.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{consisted}} of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds {{in an effort}} to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff <b>dirt</b> <b>in</b> each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid out on the ground would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.|$|E
