40|$|The {{application}} of the copper bromide (CuBr) laser as an attractive tool in the micro-machining of different materials has been demonstrated. High-quality drilling <b>by</b> <b>trepanning</b> and precision cutting was established on several materials with a negligible heat-affected zone (HAZ). That good performance {{was a result of}} the combination of high power visible radiation, short pulses, and close to the diffraction-limited laser beam quality with high-speed galvo scanner beam steering.

50|$|James Hill died on 18 October 1776 and {{is buried}} in St Michael’s churchyard in Dumfries. He {{advanced}} {{the understanding of the}} treatment of head injury by showing that epidural and subdural haematoma could be recognised from clinical features and successfully treated <b>by</b> <b>trepan</b> and surgical drainage to relieve compression.He appreciated the importance of cerebral compression and the significance of unilateral limb weakness in lateralising intracranial bleeding and determining on which side to operate. This work represented a significant advance in our {{understanding of the nature of}} brain injury following trauma and how it should be treated.|$|R
25|$|On 26 April 1798, Gyulay became Oberst of {{the newly}} formed Infantry Regiment # 48. In the War of the Second Coalition, his troops drove off French attacks in the Battle of Verona on 26 April 1799. At the Battle of Magnano on 6 April, his {{regiment}} formed part of Ferdinand Minckwitz's brigade in Konrad Valentin von Kaim's division. While leading an attacking column against Antoine Delmas' French division, he was struck {{in the head by}} a musket ball. The bullet was removed <b>by</b> <b>trepanning</b> at Verona, but the dangerous injury forced Gyulay to retire from the army the next year. He was appointed General-Major on 24 July 1800.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} neural networks {{is that the}} representations they learn are usually incomprehensible to humans. We have developed an algorithm, called Trepan, for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks. Given a trained network, Trepan produces a decision tree that approximates the concept represented by the network. In this article, we discuss the application of Trepan to a neural network trained on a noisy time series task: predicting the Dollar-Mark exchange rate. We present experiments that show that Trepan is able to extract a decision tree from this network that equals the network in terms of predictive accuracy, yet provides a comprehensible concept representation. Moreover, our experiments indicate that decision trees induced directly from the training data using conventional algorithms do not match the accuracy nor the comprehensibility of the tree extracted <b>by</b> <b>Trepan.</b> 1 Introduction Neural networks {{are perhaps the most}} wi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{strategic}} role that a systematic approach to {{planning for a}} designed industrial experiment plays in technological process innovation. Problem Definition: the case study involving laser drilling process has been developed in AVIO industry, an aerospace company {{at the leading edge}} of propulsion technology. Objective: drilling of the afterburner of EJ 200 engine, called Heat Shield, partially coated by an internal thermal barrier (TBC). The holes on the area without thermal barrier were mainly made by DOF (drilling on-the-fly) method; the holes on coated area were made <b>by</b> <b>trepanning</b> because of unsatisfactory quality of the holes achievable by DOF method. To extend the use of the DOF method to this area in order to increase productivity and keep meeting geometrical and metallurgical requirements. Since the results obtained spring from a sound systematic approach, they enable to plan a future experimental phase on optimization and robustness...|$|R
