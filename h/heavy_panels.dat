60|$|And {{he pointed}} to a small door close behind him, which led to an inner closet at right angles with the gallery. Before she had time to protest--nay! perhaps she had no wish to refuse--he had {{disappeared}} behind its <b>heavy</b> <b>panels,</b> quickly calling to his dog to follow him. But in that one moment's hesitation, those few brief and delicious words hastily exchanged, she had lost her opportunity for escape.|$|E
60|$|Then as {{the door}} {{remained}} obstinately closed--too long at any rate for M. le Marquis's impatience--he boldly placed {{his hand on the}} knob and threw it open. The <b>heavy</b> <b>panels</b> flew back, revealing Lord Eglinton sitting at his secrétaire writing. His head was resting on his hand, but he {{turned to look at the}} two gentlemen, as they stood, momentarily silent and subdued in the doorway itself. He rose to greet them, but stared at them somewhat astonished and not a little haughtily, and he made no motion requesting them to enter.|$|E
60|$|Diogenes, still {{carrying}} Gilda, {{pushed the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>panelled</b> door open with his foot, and without looking either to {{right or left}} of him made straight for the huge open hearth, wherein already logs of pinewood had been set ablaze, and beside which stood an armchair, covered with Utrecht velvet.|$|R
50|$|Apse Manor is a {{manor house}} on the Isle of Wight, {{situated}} just within the eastern boundary of the Newchurch parish.

25|$|The ambiguously named Buffet was {{actually}} the hotel's bar. It was decorated {{in the style of}} a medieval castle with <b>heavy</b> beams, <b>paneled</b> ceilings, and wooden booths. There were murals, lead glass windows, and metal chandeliers.|$|R
60|$|Turan dashed {{himself against}} {{the door of his}} prison in a vain effort to break through the solid skeel to the side of Tara whom he knew to be in grave danger, but the <b>heavy</b> <b>panels</b> held and he succeeded only in {{bruising}} his shoulders and his arms. At last he desisted and set about searching his prison for some other means of escape. He found no other opening in the stone walls, but his search revealed a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends of arms and apparel, of harness and ornaments and insignia, and sleeping silks and furs in great quantities. There were swords and spears and several large, two-bladed battle-axes, the heads of which bore a striking resemblance to the propellor of a small flier. Seizing one of these he attacked the door once more with great fury. He expected to hear something from I-Gos at this ruthless destruction, but no sound came to him from beyond the door, which was, he thought, too thick for the human voice to penetrate; but he would have wagered much that I-Gos heard him. Bits of the hard wood splintered at each impact of the heavy axe, but it was slow work and heavy. Presently he was compelled to rest, and so it went for what seemed hours--working almost to the verge of exhaustion and then resting for a few minutes; but ever the hole grew larger though he could see nothing of the interior of the room beyond because of the hanging that I-Gos had drawn across it after he had locked Turan within.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reader will}} doubtless have imagined, from what I have been saying, that the Palazzo Giustiniani had {{not all that}} {{machinery}} which we know in our houses here as modern improvements. It had nothing of the kind, and life there was, as in most houses in Italy, a kind of permanent camping out. When I remember {{the small amount of}} carpeting, of furniture, and of upholstery we enjoyed, it appears to me pathetic; and yet, I am not sure that it was not the wisest way to live. I know that we had compensation in things not purchasable here for money. If the furniture of the principal bedroom was somewhat scanty, its dimensions were unstinted the ceiling was fifteen feet high, and was divided into rich and <b>heavy</b> <b>panels,</b> adorned each with a mighty rosette of carved and gilded wood, two feet across. The parlor had not its original decorations in our time, but it had once had so noble a carved ceiling that it was found worth while to take it down and sell it into England; and it still had two grand Venetian mirrors, a vast and very good painting of a miracle of St. Anthony, and imitation- antique tables and arm-chairs. The last were frolicked all over with carven nymphs and cupids; but they were of such frail construction that they were not meant to be sat in, much less to be removed from the wall against which they stood; and more than one of our American visitors was dismayed at having these proud articles of furniture go to pieces upon his attempt to use them like mere arm-chairs of ordinary life. Scarcely less impressive or useless than these was a monumental plaster-stove, surmounted by a bust of Æsculapius; when this was broken by accident, we cheaply repaired the loss with a bust of Homer (the dealer in the next campo being out of Æsculapiuses) which no one could have told from the bust it replaced; and this and the other artistic glories of the room made us quite forget all possible blemishes and defects. And will the reader mention any house with modern improvements in America which has also windows, with pointed arches of marble, opening upon balconies that overhang the Grand Canal? ...|$|E

50|$|Moore's Auto Body and Paint Shop, {{formerly}} known as Standard Gas and Oil Supply Station, is a historic filling station located in Richmond, Virginia. The oldest section was originally built as a stable in 1875. It was enlarged in 1926. It is a one-story, stuccoed brick building in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The structure has an irregular plan, with the northern facade formed in a crescent shape {{and the rest of}} the building in rectangular forms. The central section features <b>heavy</b> <b>paneled</b> stuccoed pilasters connected by a corbeled brick table and a paneled parapet. The building was used as a filling station until 1936, after which it was occupied by a series of automobile repair businesses.|$|R

50|$|Orange Vale, {{also known}} as the Lawler-Whiting House, is a Greek Revival {{plantation}} house completed in 1854 near Talladega, Alabama. The house is principally associated with Levi Lawler, an Alabama state legislator. The house was the centerpiece of a 3000 acre cotton plantation. It was principally used by Lawler during the summer. The house is a formal two-story frame structure with a hexastyle square-columned portico across the front, supporting a <b>heavy</b> <b>paneled</b> entablature. There is no pediment. The hipped roof is flanked by interior chimneys. Small flat-roofed one-story pavilions flank the house on either side and extend beyond the rear of the house.The rear has two-level porches across the width. The interior has a center-hall plan with the hall extending to the back porch. 108 acre remain of the original property, with seven other buildings.|$|R
50|$|The Roll Out Solar Array, {{known as}} ROSA, is a solar array {{designed}} by NASA. This {{new type of}} solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays. Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with <b>heavy</b> <b>panels</b> folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays. It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff composite material, flattened and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the insulation properties of dry systems for impact noise reduction is usually performed in laboratory, according to ISO 10140 standard. The use of dry systems made by panels consisting of mineralised spruce wood-wool bound with Portland cement combined with recycled rubber is a good solution for improving acoustic performance of floors. This kind of dry systems is very interesting {{not only from the}} acoustic point of view, but also for environmental sustainability. In fact both materials derive from recycled elements or from ecological and bio-compatible production cycles. The aim of this work is the {{evaluation of}} dry floating floors made of a combination of different resilient sub-layers loaded by rigid <b>heavy</b> <b>panels,</b> with a focus on the test conditions and sample setup. The configurations that were chosen of these different layers starting from feedback of dynamic stiffness, rated according to EN 29052 - 1 standard. The results were then compared with the estimated assessment of the acoustic performance proposed by EN 12354 - 2 standard...|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the level of}} risk to seismic hazards of the Cardiology Hospital of the National Medical Center “Siglo XXI”, the Children’s Hospital “Dr. Federico Gómez ” and the “Hospital de Jesus ” in Mexico City, Mexico. Vulnerability of these installations was measured using optimal theoretical vulnerability indicators. Our {{results indicate that the}} main elements that increase structural risk are the lack of enough separation among the hospital’s buildings generating a pounding effect in case of a local earthquake. Another factor is the use of bridges to connect buildings. Also, the type and age of construction as well as heavy objects or architectural elements placed on the roofs of the buildings not considered in the original structural design. Regarding the non-structural risk, the main problems are the use of building materials not appropriated for hospitals such as <b>heavy</b> <b>panels</b> in ceilings and large windows without protection to prevent breaking. The main elements identified that increase the functional vulnerability are the lack of special rooms for care of patients in shock. Another factor is the lack of emergency exits and stairs. The high social-administrative risk is caused by the lack of a response and/or a mitigation plan. It is possible to reduce risk of these three hospitals with low cost mitigation measures such as development and implementation of an operational emergency plan, providing regular structural maintenance to buildings, removing heavy installations from the roofs of the structures, installing locks in the medical devices and equipment as well as adopting structural seismic-resistant measures...|$|E
50|$|Providence Anime Conference was {{announced}} at Anime Boston 2007 with a 21-and-older age requirement and programing geared towards mature fans. The convention estimated that attendance {{would be in}} the thousands for the first year, and instituted a 2000-attendee cap, but only registered 211 paid attendees. Problems with the convention included a remote convention location, an expensive convention center with limited public transportation, the 21-and-older age requirement, and no one-day passes. At times, the convention's halls were empty due to <b>heavy</b> <b>panel</b> attendance and the dealers suffered due to the frugality of the attendees. Positives included cash bars selling alcoholic beverages, the use of adult language, and full panel rooms with good Q&A's and discussions. The low attendance caused the convention to lose money and not return for the immediate future.|$|R
60|$|Turan {{drew his}} short-sword and {{cautiously}} descended. At the bottom {{was a short}} corridor with a closed door at the end. He approached the single <b>heavy</b> <b>panel</b> and listened. No sound came to him from beyond the mysterious portal. Gently he tried the door, which swung easily toward him at his touch. Before him was a low-ceiled chamber with a dirt floor. Set in its walls were several other doors and all were closed. As Turan stepped cautiously within, the third warrior descended the spiral runway behind him. The panthan crossed the room quickly and tried a door. It was locked. He heard a muffled click behind him and turned about with ready sword. He was alone; but the door through which he had entered was closed--it was the click of its lock that he had heard.|$|R
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the <b>heavy</b> <b>panel</b> is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} design of three major structural components within NASA's Ares V heavy lift vehicle using a novel fiber reinforced foam composite sandwich panel concept is presented. The Ares V payload shroud, interstage, and core intertank {{are designed for}} minimum mass using this panel concept, which consists of integral composite webs separated by structural foam between two composite facesheets. The HyperSizer structural sizing software, in conjunction with NASTRAN finite element analyses, is used. However, since HyperSizer does not currently include a panel concept for fiber reinforced foam, the sizing was performed using two separate approaches. In the first, the panel core is treated as an effective (homogenized) material, whose properties are provided by the vendor. In the second approach, the panel is treated as a blade stiffened sandwich panel, with {{the mass of the}} foam added after completion of the panel sizing. Details of the sizing {{for each of the three}} Ares V components are given, and it is demonstrated that the two panel sizing approaches are in reasonable agreement for thinner panel designs, but as the panel thickness increases, the blade stiffened sandwich <b>panel</b> approach yields <b>heavier</b> <b>panel</b> designs. This is due to the effects of local buckling, which are not considered in the effective core property approach...|$|R

5000|$|Wall hangings {{had been}} long in use — the leather, the damask, velvent, and arras or tapestry. The Flemish tapestries, {{from the time of}} their first manufacture, were in great favor. Elizabeth had a set wrought {{signalizing}} the dispersion and destruction of the Spanish Armada. So fine had they become that they were often preferred to other decoration, and in the Stuart time were stretched across the noble old carved panelwork itself. [...] "Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry," [...] wrote Evelyn, {{in the last years of}} Charles II, concerning the Gobelins tapestry, established under the royal patronage in France: [...] "for design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best paintings, beyond any thing I had ever beheld. Some pieces had Versailles, St. Germains, and other palaces of the French king, with huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life rarely done." [...] Yet works in tapestry had been, long before this, under royal protection in England also, the Raphael cartoons having been purchased by Charles I for the use of the establishment at Mortlake, which, however, did not outlast that sovereign more than half a century; and the employment of draperies had become so profuse that they now largely took the place of the <b>heavy</b> <b>paneled</b> wooden tops which had so long encumbered the bedsteads.|$|R
2500|$|All the {{first-class}} public rooms, and the en-suite staterooms of {{the upper}} deck, were generally heavily panelled, in oak, satinwood or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as [...] "French Renaissance" [...] which {{was applied to the}} forward first-class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in [...] "Elizabethan style", comprising <b>heavy</b> oak <b>panels</b> surrounding the first open fireplace ever to be used aboard a passenger liner.|$|R
40|$|Gate road {{development}} lies on {{the critical}} path in the longwall production process. To address this issue industry has invested substantial resources in developing technologies such as continuous haulage and bolting cycle automation. There has been limited focus on improvement of ancillary development processes and technologies such as the provision of face and panel services and the panel advance process. A monorail system has been in use for some years at Mandalong Mine near Lake Macquarie in N. S. W. The Macquarie Monorail system is an integrated gate road development services unit and differs from many existing monorail units employed in underground operations as {{it is designed to}} manage all face services while as well as carrying <b>heavy</b> <b>panel</b> plant such as the section load centre and auxiliary fan. Use of the system at the Mandalong Mine has resulted in increased productivity and safety performance during gate road development. Reductions in service move and operating delay times of 32 % and 25 % were observed respectively along with a 70 % reduction in manual handling injuries. The system is not without its disadvantages chief being significant manual handling is necessary in the erection of the relatively heavy monorail structure and replacement of the flexible ventilation ducting. Despite these minor limitations of the system, the overall safety and productivity performance of gate road development was found to be superior to conventional development units...|$|R

25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, <b>heavier</b> <b>panels).</b> To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|R
