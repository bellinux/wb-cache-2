5000|$|Cleusonite is {{a member}} of the crichtonite group of {{minerals}} with a chemical formula of (Pb,Sr)(U4+,U6+)(Fe2+,Zn)(Ti,Fe2+,Fe3+)18(O,OH)38. [...] This group of minerals contains approximately thirteen complex metal titanates. The structures of minerals of this group is complicated by frequent fine-scale twinning and metamictization due to radioactive elements. The crichtonite group consists of members of related mineral species of the type A{BC2D6E12}O38 which are characterized by their predominant cations (as seen in crichtonite (Sr), senaite (Pb), <b>davidite</b> (REE + U), landauite (Na), loveringite (Ca), lindsleyite (Ba), and mathiasite (K).|$|E

40|$|The Precambrian {{rocks of}} Australia contain {{a wider variety}} of david-ites than has been found {{elsewhere}} in the world. Investigation of <b>davidite</b> occurrences as an economic uranium ore {{over a number of years}} has revealed its many peculiar physical and chemical characteristics.

In this article the claim in 2 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 34 that Josiah was a king like no other - including the adored David - will be examined.

40|$|Materials {{designed}} for nuclear waste disposal include {{a range of}} ceramics, glass ceramics and glass waste forms. Those with crystalline phases have provided the momentum for studies of minerals {{as a means to}} understand aspects of waste-form crystal chemistry, behaviour in aqueous systems and radiation damage over geological periods of time. Although the utility of natural analogue studies varies, depending upon the degree of analogy to the proposed geological repository and other factors such as chemical composition, the available data suggest that Th-U host phases such as brannerite, monazite, pyrochlore, zircon and zirconolite are resistant generally to dissolution in aqueous fluids at low temperatures. Geochemical durability may or may not extend to hydrothermal systems depending on the specifics of fluid composition, temperature and pressure. At elevated temperatures, for example, <b>davidite</b> may break down to new phase assemblages including titanite, ilmenite and rutile. Perovskite is generally less resistant to dissolution at low temperatures and breaks down to TiO 2, releasing A-site cations to the aqueous fluid. Studies of radiation damage indicate that the oxide and silicate phases become amorphous {{as a result of the}} gradual accumulation of alpha-recoil collision cascades. Monazite tends to remain crystalline on geological time scales, a very attractive property that potentiall...|$|E
40|$|Mamuju {{area and}} its {{surrounding}} are composed of volcanic rock containing uranium (U) and thorium (Th) elements. Radioelements concentrations in the area reach 1, 529 ppm eU and 817 ppm eTh. Radioactive minerals identified {{in the area are}} thorianite, <b>davidite,</b> gummite, and autunite. The geological structures were formed by tectonic activities which controlled the creation of volcanic complex and U-Th mineralization in the complex. Identification of geological structure in the field is very difficult due to densely vegetation and higly degree of weathering. The interpreted lineaments from Landsat- 8 imagery are the manifestation of geological structures which have controlled the existence of U and Th. Lineaments analysis using Sastratenaya formula is used to obtain the relative age and chronologies of the lineaments. Dose rate measurements in the area show the trend of radioactivitiy anomalies are trending northwest–southeast. The Sastratenaya formula results the formed structures are relatively older and dominantly directing northwest–southeast (N 140 o– 150 o E). Based on the linement interpretation, the dominant direction has similliarity with volcanic and radioactivity distribution. Structures which controlling the volcanic formation and related to U and Th mineralization generally are the northwest–southeast trending structures, which were created along with U and Th mineralization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{studies on}} the radioactive ore samples from various parts of Rajasthan and Haryana have revealed the presence of several uranium and other atomic mineral occurrences in the albitite belt of western India. The primary uranium minerals (PUMs) are uraninite and brannerite, whereas, the secondary uranium minerals (SUMs) show considerable speciations: phosphate, silicate, hydrous oxide hydrate, and vanadate. Multiple oxides (MOs) are <b>davidite,</b> fergusonite, aeschynite-(Y), microlite, samarskite, euxenite, betafite, and columbite-tantalite. The thorium minerals are huttonite, thorite, uranoan-thorite, thorianite, thorutite, and brabantite. The yttrium and REE-bearing minerals are xenotime, britholite, allanite, chevkinite, tritomite, and monazite. It is noted that the measured unit cell dimension (a 0) of the investigated uraninites ranges from 5. 4110 Å to 5. 4646 Å. The highest unit cell dimension (5. 4646 Å) represents a composition (or oxidation grade) of UO 2. 05, whereas, the lowest one (5. 4110 Å) corresponds to a composition of UO 2. 54. Furthermore, it is also apparent that, with increase in oxidation grade, there is a concomitant decrease in unit cell dimension. As most {{of the values of}} a o of uraninites from the albitite belt are high (> 5. 45 Å), it may be inferred that the overall temperature of formation of uraninites of the albitite belt was higher (ca. 400 °C). However, the low values of a 0 in certain localities could be due to the prevalence o...|$|E

40|$|The Radium Hill uranium deposit, in {{semi-arid}} eastern South Australia, {{was discovered}} in 1906 and mined for radium between 1906 and 1931 and for uranium between 1954 and 1961 (production of 969 300 t of <b>davidite</b> ore averaging 0. 12 % U 3 O 8). Rehabilitation was limited to removal of mine facilities, sealing of underground workings and capping of selected waste repositories. In 2002, gamma-ray data and samples of tailings, uncrushed and crushed waste rock, stream sediment, topsoil and vegetation were collected to assist in examination of the current environmental status of the mine site. The data indicate that capping of tailings storage facilities did not ensure the long-term containment of the low-level radioactive wastes due to the erosion of sides of the impoundments. Moreover, wind erosion of waste fines (phyllosilicates, ore minerals) from various, physically unstable waste repositories has caused increasing radiochemical (from a background dose of 35 - 70 nSv/hr to max. 0. 94 Sv/hr) and geochemical (Ce, Cr, La, Lu, Rb, Sc, Th, U, V, Y, Yb) impacts on local soils. Plants (saltbush, pepper tree) growing on waste dumps display evidence of biological uptake of lithophile elements, with values being up to 1 - 2 orders of magnitude above values for plants {{of the same species}} at background sites. However, radiation doses associated with the mine and processing site average 0. 67 Sv/hr; hence, visitors to the Radium Hill site will not be exposed to excessive radiation levels. Although rehabilitation procedures have been partly successful in reducing dispersion of U and related elements into the surrounding environment, it is apparent that 20 years after rehabilitation, there is significant physical and limited chemical mobility, including transfer into plants. Additional capping and landform design of the crushed waste and tailings repositories are required in order to minimise erosion and impacts on surrounding soils and sediments...|$|E
40|$|The {{geological}} {{province of}} the Mount Painter in the North Flinders Ranges (South Australia) is well-known for its uranium mineralisation, and uraniferous granites. The presence in the nearby Cenozoic sediments of the Lake Frome basin of uranium mineralisations (Beverley deposit) and the recent discovery of the Four Mile deposit has triggered the interest of explorers. Based on extensive laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) U-Pb geochronological data and mineralogy of U-Th-bearing minerals, rock geochemistry and petrography, we present a global study on the mobility of U, Th and REE in the Mount Painter Domain, including a detailed reconstitution of the Beverley deposit genesis. Seven significant stages of U-Th-REE mobility are recognised: 1. The possible presence U-enriched ~ 1600 Ma lower crust under the MPD 2. Intrusion of two A-type Mesoproterozoic granites suites (~ 1575, and ~ 1560 Ma respectively) with high HFSE contents and crustal origin; the porphyritic biotite K-rich highly-enriched Yerila granite belongs to the youngest suite and hosts magmatic allanite-(Ce), potassic-hastingsite, ilmenite, fergusonite-(Y), chevkinite, molybdenite, zircon, uranothorite, uraninite and titanite and fluorite 3. Late-magmatic or post-magmatic metasomatism in the same granites; evidenced by F-rich annite, zircon, Y-bearing Al-F-titanite (400 °C), Y-rich fluorapatite, synchysite-(Ce) and fluorite. Early ilmenite, molybdenite, allanite-(Ce) and oligoclase reacted with an alkaline oxidising F-rich melt or fluid. The latemagmatic to post-magmatic metasomatism is also recorded at the intrusion contact in regional rocks, forming allanite-, magnetite-, uranothorite-, zircon- (1501 ± 6 Ma), and uraninite-bearing calcsilicate skarns. The spreading of zircon ages in the Yerila granite (~ 1565 to ~ 1521) relates to the mixing of magmatic and metasomatic crystals. 4. the MPD was subject to the Delamerian orogeny and related metamorphism (amphibolite facies); most Mesoproterozoic granitic assemblages present signs of recrystallisation or stress; recrystallisation of monazite-(Ce) and xenotime-(Y) during Paleozoic (Cambrian) (490 - 495 Ma). U-Th-rich minerals also bear Delamerian ages (polycrase-(Y), euxenite-(Y), davidite-(La) and uraninite). 5. Anatexis of local basement during Ordovician and generation of peraluminous granite (British Empire granite) with low Th/U. The granite is enriched in U and Y. We provide the first robust ages on it: 456 ± 9 and 459 ± 9 Ma on zircon, 453. 3 ± 4. 6 on xenotime-(Y). 6. Very active hydrothermal/pegmatitic uranium remobilisation along active faults; brannerite-quartz veins formation (367 ± 13 Ma), further signs of remobilisation or hydrothermal event during Permian (284 ± 25 Ma in thorite) and around the Mt Gee (~ 290 Ma radiogenic gain in <b>davidite)</b> which agrees with the previous data (paleomagnetic ages of 250 - 300 Ma). 7. Cenozoic supergene uranium remobilisation in MPD and migration of U-rich oxidised groundwaters into the Lake Frome. The uranium is precipitated in the sandy formation {{of the lake and}} in the top layer of the underlying organic-matter-rich clays and silts. The micro-environment of reduction efficiently trap U but also REE, fingerprinting the REE-rich MPD granite source. Coffinite and carnotite give concordant Pliocene ages (6. 7 to 3. 4 Ma). Provenance studies on the sands hosting the Beverley mineralisations suggest a reworking of Early Cretaceous glacial or glacio-lacustrine sediments originally sourced in Eastern Australia (Lachlan Fold Belt). The youngest recorded zircon (130 Ma) doesn’t constrain the sediment age but refines the provenance region (New England Orogen). Thesis (Ph. D.)
