5|$|Milan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off. Playing in a 4–2–3–1 formation, they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{attack of}} the match, but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross-field pass. Milan responded with two low {{attempts}} on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led to a corner, from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> chance of the match in the ninth minute. A slip from Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant to run into space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him, Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.|$|E
50|$|From 2004 to 2006, the flip-up puzzle {{was used}} to {{determine}} who would be in control.

Another flip-up puzzle would be used to determine who would be in control for round 4. Like the July 1996 - 1998 era, the red podium was reserved for the carry-over champion.|$|R
50|$|From July 1996 until 1998, {{the host}} would ask a trivia {{question}} and the contestant who buzzed in with the correct answer would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> spin. During this time the red podium was reserved for the carry-over champion as there was an opportunity for any contestant to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> spin. <b>The</b> process used during this period {{was a form of}} continuous play.For example: If the red player buzzed in to start round 1, but the yellow player solved the puzzle the blue player would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> spin in round 2.|$|R

5|$|The American League (AL) and the National League (NL) alternated picks {{throughout}} the first round; because an NL team drafted {{first in the}} 1986 MLB Draft, an AL team <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> selection in 1987. Having finished 67–95 in 1986, the Seattle Mariners had the worst record in the AL and thus obtained the first overall selection. The second selection went to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the worst record in the NL.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{overall pick}} on six occasions. Twice in 1978 and 1984, they traded it away.

5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the restart, Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> attack. Striker Michael Owen went past United defender Brown, but {{he was unable to}} shoot when the ball got stuck in between his feet. A minute later, Liverpool had an appeal for a penalty after striker Emile Heskey went down in the United penalty area, but referee Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. They had another chance in the 52nd minute after an exchange of passes between Murphy and Heskey, but Murphy's shot went over the bar. United began to exert more pressure on Liverpool after this. A minute later a shot by Keane was blocked by Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä. The ball went out for a United, which resulted in a throw-in, that was headed into the arms of Dudek. Five minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had a chance to score as he turned and shot at the Liverpool goal, but it was saved by Dudek. Heskey was replaced by striker Milan Baroš following an injury.|$|E

5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, {{the team with}} the worst overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, {{the team with the}} worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E

Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying to clear it. The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel. Four minutes later, in the final minute of stoppage time, Atlético de Kolkata substitute Mohammed Rafique headed home a corner from Podaný to win the match and the championship.|$|E
