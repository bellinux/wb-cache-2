5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E

25|$|In the diffuse-porous woods, the {{demarcation}} between rings is {{not always}} so clear {{and in some cases}} is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the <b>growth</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the {{latewood}} of a <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> {{is usually}} darker in color than the earlywood, this fact {{may be used}} in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.|$|E
25|$|In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, catalpa, chestnut, elm, hickory, mulberry, and oak, {{the larger}} vessels or pores (as cross {{sections}} of vessels are called) are localized {{in the part}} of the <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers.

40|$|One {{significant}} {{source of}} annual temperature and precipitation data arises from the regular annual secondary <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> of trees. Several tropical tree species are observed to form regular growth bands {{that may or may}} not form annually. Such growth was observed in one stem disk of the tropical legume Hymenaea courbaril near the area of David, Panama. In comparison to annual reference {Delta}{sup 14 }C values from wood and air, the {Delta}{sup 14 }C values from the secondary <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> formed by H. courbaril were determined to be annual in nature in this one stem disk specimen. During this study, H. courbaril was also observed to translocate recently produced photosynthate into older <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> as sapwood is converted to heartwood. This process alters the overall {Delta}{sup 14 }C values of these transitional <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> as cellulose with a higher {Delta}{sup 14 }C content is translocated into <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> with a relatively lower {Delta}{sup 14 }C content. Once the annual nature of these <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> is established, further stable isotope analyses on H. courbaril material in other studies may help to complete gaps in the understanding of short and of long term global climate patterns...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{formation}} of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> {{has been confirmed}} for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of annual rings for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of annual rings in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage. Crossdating analysis confirmed the existence of annual <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in the R. mangle in Guaratiba. This discovery in a region with low hydric seasonality increases the dendrocronological potential of this species and suggests the importance of biological factors (eg. phenological behavior) as complementary inductors for the {{formation of}} <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in this species...|$|R
500|$|Environment {{affects the}} size of the first <b>growth</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] Size, curvature, and {{thickness}} and number of transverse rings are indicative of age. [...] Up to two years, there are thicker transverse rings, of greater length and flexion than in adults. Into adulthood, thinner horn rings force the thick transverse rings upward. [...] Growth increment slows earlier in maturation in females than in males. [...] Researchers use genitalia and sexual behaviour to distinguish the sexes. [...] Females have two pairs of mammae.|$|E
500|$|Schwimmer {{noted in}} 2002 that Erickson and Brochu's {{assumptions}} about growth rates are only valid if the osteodermal rings reflect annual periods, {{as they do}} in modern crocodilians. According to Schwimmer, the <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> patterns observed could have been affected by a variety of factors, including [...] "migrations of their prey, wet-dry seasonal climate variations, or oceanic circulation and nutrient cycles". If the ring cycle were [...] biannual rather than annual, this might indicate Deinosuchus grew faster than modern crocodilians, and had a similar maximum lifespan.|$|E
500|$|A {{histological}} {{examination of}} P. mongoliensis has determined {{the growth rate}} of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than 1kilogramme (2.2lb), while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost 20kilogrammes (44lb). This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and marsupial mammals, but slower than modern birds and placental mammals. An age determination study performed on the fossilized remains of P. mongoliensis by [...] using <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> counts suggest that the longevity of the basal ceratopsian was 10 to 11 years.|$|E
25|$|Dinosaur bones often contain {{lines of}} arrested growth (LAGs), formed by {{alternating}} periods of slow and fast growth; in fact many studies count <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> {{to estimate the}} ages of dinosaurs. The formation of <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> is usually driven by seasonal changes in temperature, and this seasonal influence has sometimes been regarded {{as a sign of}} slow metabolism and ectothermy. But <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> are found in polar bears and in mammals that hibernate. The relationship between LAGs and seasonal growth dependency remains unresolved.|$|R

500|$|A {{histological}} {{study by}} Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, {{and others in}} 2009 estimated that Archaeopteryx grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of Archaeopteryx bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of Archaeopteryx come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of Archaeopteryx could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (<b>growth</b> <b>ring)</b> analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in Archaeopteryx. The poorly vascularized bone of Archaeopteryx might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated {{how long it would}} take to [...] "grow" [...] each specimen of Archaeopteryx to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of [...] The study also found that the avialans Jeholornis and Sapeornis grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid Mahakala. The avialans Confuciusornis and Ichthyornis grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi, and the authors speculated that Archaeopteryx and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of tree rings {{in the tropics}} is less straightforward than in temperate areas with a demarcated unfavourable winter season. But especially in mangroves, the highly dynamic intertidal environment and the overriding ecological drivers therein have been a reason for questioning the existence of <b>growth</b> <b>rings.</b> This study aimed at casting light on <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in mangroves. In six mangrove species growing in Gazi Bay, Kenya (Sonneratia alba, Heritiera littoralis, Ceriops tagal, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Xylocarpus granatum and Lumnitzera racemosa), the occurrence of <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> was examined. <b>Growth</b> rate of each species was determined based on a 1 -year period using the cambial marking technique.

Climatic conditions that result in a range of soil water salinity experienced over the year are a prerequisite for the formation of <b>growth</b> <b>rings.</b> For species with an anatomy characterized by indistinct ring boundaries, this should be combined with a growth rate of at least 0. 3  mm/year.

Additionally, the study has revealed high mean annual ring width values ranging from 4. 4 to 5. 6 mm in both charcoal and slash and burn regrowth stands. The pattern of ring development per year and the mean annual ring width values provide a basis for the use of ring counts in determining the age of Miombo regrowth stands and predicting the merchantable age for key Miombo woodland species. The results can therefore be used in planning the cutting cycles in Miombo woodlands.
