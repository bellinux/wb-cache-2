30|$|Several {{methods are}} {{reported}} [1, 4, 7] for AgNPs synthesis, among them, most conventional and comfortable method is {{the reduction of}} the metal salt solution by means of reducing agents like N,N-dimethyl form amide, when the above chemicals used as reducing agent, it causes environmental toxicity or hazards. Alternatively, researchers are interested towards the green synthesis of AgNPs to avoid the negative impact on the environment [21, 22]. AgNPs synthesis using polysaccharides [14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] is an alternative resolution for the aforementioned complications. The synthesis of AgNPs by different plant parts such as leaf, fruit, bark, latex, stem, gums and various biological systems has been reported [16, 17, 19, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Although the synthesis of AgNPs using polysaccharides has some disadvantages, it needs more time for the synthesis. Similarly, the as-synthesized AgNPs showed lower catalytic and biological activity. To activate the AgNPs, carboxymethylation is one of the systems utilized for the functionalization of natural polymers [33]. Carboxymethylation in general expands the hydrophilicity and solution clearness of the polysaccharides and improves it dissolvable in an aqueous system. It is a broadly utilized alteration technique in light of its simplicity of handling, bring down cost of chemicals and versatility of the product obtained. Many natural gums such as Cassia tora <b>gum,</b> <b>gellan,</b> guar <b>gum,</b> and gum karaya were investigated using the carboxymethylation process [34, 35, 36, 37].|$|R

[4] and gum kondagogu [5] can be {{utilized}} as reducing and stabilizing agents for the silver nanoparticle biosynthesis. <b>Gum</b> <b>gellan,</b> a microbial heteropolysaccharide, was employed for similar {{purpose in the}} case of gold nanoparticles [6]. Gum ghatti is a naturally occurring water soluble, complex polysaccharide derived as an exudate from the bark of Anogeissus latifolia (Combretaceae family), a native tree of the Indian sub-continent. The name gum ghatti has originated from its transportation through mountain passes or ghats. This native Indian gum is collected from the forests by the tribals and marketed through government organizations such as Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Visakhapatnam, India. The world production of gum ghatti is about 1, 000 – 1, 500 MT/year [7, 8]. This biopolymer is an arabinogalactan type of natural gum and its morphological, structural, physico-chemical, compositional, solution, thermal, rheological, and emulsifying properties have been well documented and studied [9 – 17]. This biopolymer is a high-arabinose, protein rich, acidic heteropolysaccharide, occurring in nature as mixed calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salt [12 – 14, 16]. The primary structure of this gum is composed of sugars such as, l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-xylose, and d-glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 48 : 29 : 10 : 5 : 10 and < 1 % of rhamnose, which is present as non-reducing end-groups. The gum contains alternating 4 -O- substituted and 2 -O-substituted α d-mannopyranose units and chains of 1 → 6 linked β d-galactopyranose units with side chains of l-arabinofuranose residues. Six percent of rhamnose in the polysaccharide is linked to the galactose backbone as α-Rhap-(1 → 4) β-galactopyranose side chain. It has a molecular weight of 8.94 × 107 g/mol [12, 13, 15, 16].|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{nanomaterials}} play {{a substantial}} role {{in science and}} technology due to their unique shape, size, peculiar properties and wide range of potential applications. Metal nanoparticles possessing considerable electronic, chemical and optical [1, 2] properties, are different from the bulk materials. Among the several metal nanoparticles, AuNPs have attracted the attention of scientists due to their numerous applications in catalysis, sensing, imaging, and diagnostics [3, 4, 5, 6]. ‘AuNPs’ is the area of research interest due to their unique properties such as tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface-enhanced Raman scattering, electrical, magnetic, thermal conductivity, antibacterial activity, chemical and biostability [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Besides this, the use of AuNPs as potential materials in the field of drug delivery and DNA delivery systems is noteworthy [14, 15]. Most of the available methods for the synthesis of AuNPs involve photochemical reduction, chemical reduction, and electrochemical reduction [16, 17, 18]. The reagents used in these methods are NaBH 4, hydrazine, ascorbic acid and amino acids which are capable of being oxidized. However, the uses of such chemical reagents that are toxic and ecologically injurious are to be avoided in the synthesis of AuNPs [19, 20]. Hence, the above-mentioned chemical methods are non-ecofriendly in nature and have inherent drawbacks. The replacement of non-ecofriendly synthesis methods with clean, non-toxic and globally acceptable green chemistry methods [21] is the current need in the synthesis of AuNPs. Several biological systems such as bacteria, fungi, fruit extract and plants can actively reduce metal ions to form metal nanoparticles in an ecofriendly manner [22, 23, 24]. Among these, gums obtained from plants such as <b>gum</b> <b>gellan,</b> chitosan and katira gum, (natural polymers), etc., act as reducing agents and stabilizing agents [25, 26, 27].

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of incorporation of selected additives on fat uptake and sensory quality of two traditional deep fried snacks. Design/methodology/approach – A wheat-based snack Diamond cuts, and a rice and gram-based spicy snack Kodbale, were chosen. The products were prepared by incorporating to the dough, 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 per cent of 11 different additives like gum acacia, gum Tragacanth, Methylcellulose, Gaur Gum, Pectin, Gum Karaya, Gum Carageenan, Xanthan <b>Gum,</b> <b>Gum</b> <b>Gellan,</b> Seafoam and Beligara. Products were evaluated for sensory attributes and fat uptake was estimated by soxhlet extraction. Findings – Results indicated that average fat uptake in Diamond cuts and Kodbale was 28. 00 and 30 per cent, respectively. In Diamond cuts, while addition of additives did not alter fat uptake remarkably, a slight decrease in the case of gum Tragacanth (0. 2 per cent) and Gaur Gum and Gum Carageenan (0. 75 per cent) was observed. Statistical analysis of sensory attributes revealed only a marginal difference in textural quality of Diamond cuts incorporated with Gaur Gum, Pectin and Beligara. In Kodbale, fat uptake was marginally lowered by the addition of Gaur Gum, gum Tragacanth, Xanthan Gum and Gum Carageenan at 0. 75 per cent. No significant differences were observed among the sensory qualities except for marginal differences in textural quality of Kodbale incorporated with Gaur Gum, Gum Carageenan and Beligara. It can be concluded that addition of additives did not influence the fat uptake or sensory quality of fried products studied to a significant extent. Originality/value – Since some of the additives improved textural quality of products and fried products are usually stored and consumed, these additives can probably help in improving the texture of stored products.

40|$|Ceramic {{industry}} {{represents an}} important sector {{of economic activity}} in the European countries and involves complex and numerous manufacturing processes. The unidirectional dry pressing process includes milling and stirring of raw materials (mainly clay and talc minerals) in aqueous suspensions, followed by spray drying to remove excess water obtaining spray-dried powders further subjected to dry pressing process (conformation). However, spray-dried ceramic powders exhibit an important variability in their performance when subjected to the dry pressing process, particularly in the adhesion to the mold and mechanical strength, affecting the quality of the final conformed ceramic products. Therefore, several synthetic additives (deflocculants, antifoams, binders, lubricants and plasticizers) are introduced in the ceramic slips to achieve uniform and homogeneous pastes, conditioning their rheological properties. However, an important variability associated with the performance of the conformed products is still reported. Exopolysaccharides or Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) are polymers excreted by living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which may confer unique and potentially interesting properties with potential industrial uses, such as viscosity control, gelation, and flocculation. Polysaccharides, such as pullulan, gellan, carrageenan and xanthan have found a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, petroleum, and in other industries. The aim of this study was the assessment of exopolysaccharides as natural additives to optimize the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during the unidirectional dry pressing process, replacing the synthetic additives used in the ceramic production process. Six exopolysaccharides, namely pullulan, <b>gellan,</b> xanthan <b>gum,</b> κappa- and iota-carrageenan, and guar gum were tested in steatite-based spray-dried ceramic powders at different concentrations. Subsequently, these ceramic powders were submitted to unidirectional dry pressing process (conformation) and the green conformed bodies were tested on the following properties: mechanical flexural strength and adhesion/disaggregation of the conformed material. The binding state of polysaccharides and mineral grains was evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Our data showed that xanthan gum and pullulan were the most effective polysaccharides in improving the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during unidirectional dry pressing process, in comparison to the control steatite-based ceramic bodies containing synthetic additives. In addition, these polysaccharides yielded the best cost-benefit relationship, representing an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic additives used in technical ceramics industry. Hence, this study has contributed to define a new and sustainable strategy to improve the performance of ceramic materials during unidirectional dry pressing process, reduce production costs and minimize environmental impact.

40|$|Aqueous {{lubrication}} {{is currently}} {{at the forefront}} of tribological research due to the desire to learn and potentially mimic how nature lubricates biotribological contacts. We focus here on understanding the lubrication properties of naturally occurring polysaccharides in aqueous solution using a combination of tribology, adsorption, and rheology. The polysaccharides include pectin, xanthan <b>gum,</b> <b>gellan,</b> and locus bean gum that are all widely used in food and nonfood applications. They form theologically complex fluids in aqueous solution that are both shear thinning and elastic, and their normal stress differences at high shear rates are found to be characteristic of semiflexible/rigid molecules. Lubrication is studied using a ball-on-disk tribometer with hydrophobic elastomer surfaces, mimicking biotribological contacts, and the friction coefficient is measured as a function of speed across the boundary, mixed, and hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. The hydrodynamic regime, where the friction coefficient increases with increasing lubricant entrainment speed, is found to depend on the viscosity of the polysaccharide solutions at shear rates of around 10 (4) s(- 1). The boundary regime, which occurs at the lowest entrainment speeds, depends on the adsorption of polymer to the substrate. In this regime, the friction coefficient for a rough substrate (400 nm rms roughness) is dependent on the dry mass of polymer adsorbed to the surface (obtained from surface plasmon resonance), while for a smooth substrate (10 nm rms roughness) the friction coefficient is strongly dependent on the hydrated wet mass of adsorbed polymer (obtained from quartz crystal microbalance, QCM-D). The mixed regime is dependent on both the adsorbed film properties and lubricant 2 ̆ 7 s viscosity at high shear rates. In addition, the entrainment speed where the friction coefficient is a minimum, which corresponds to the transition between the hydrodynamic and mixed regime, correlates linearly with the ratio of the wet mass and viscosity at similar to 10 (4) s(- 1) for the smooth surface. These findings are independent of the different polysaccharides used in the study and their different viscoelastic flow properties...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Food Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2004 Probiotic {{foods are}} {{intended}} to supply selected viable microorganisms, for example Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium, to consumers. These organisms, when consumed at the daily intake of 108, provide benefits beyond basic nutrition. Probiotic (AB) foods generally include fermented dairy products such as yoghurts and cheeses, targeted at the upmarket consumer. However, due to technical {{problems associated with the}} foods and the organism, viable Bifidobacterium rarely occur in AB foods. The principle aims of this study were to develop a suitable delivery system for Bifidobacterium to the consumer, and to supply these living organisms in the affordable traditional fermented African beverages, amasi and mahewu. This would provide the benefits of probiotics to the rural African consumer, where malnutrition and gastrointestinal diseases occur. The organism selected for this study was Bifidobacterium lactis DSM 10140, commonly associated with AB starter cultures for yoghurts. The delivery system selected was microencapsulation of B. lactis using a mixture of the generally recognised as safe (GRAS) edible <b>gums,</b> <b>gellan</b> and xanthan. Supply vehicles for the microcapsules to the consumer were amasi and mahewu. Prior to microencapsulation, rheological studies were undertaken to determine whether the gellan-xanthan gum mix would provide a suitable support matrix for microencapsulated B. lactis. This was done using a Paar Physica MGR 300 rotational rheometer with a cone plate 50 - 2 measuring system. Results indicated that the hydrated gellan-xanthan gum mix behaved as a non-Newtonian material, and the flow curve fitted well to the Herschel-Bulkley model. This demonstrated that the gel was a relatively viscous material with solid properties. The average yield stress of the gel was 1. 515 Pa, indicating that the gel was stable, and at lower stresses would behave as a solid. The gel mix would be disrupted by shear stresses associated with mastication and peristalsis. The minimum viscosity of the gel was constant at temperatures between 46 °C - 61 °C. It was concluded from these data that the gel was suitable for microencapsulation and that microcapsules should only be included in soft foods, which do not require chewing. Temperatures associated with microencapsulation, at minimum gel viscosities, were not lethal to B. lactis. Bifidobacterium lactis cells were incubated under anaerobic conditions (4 % H 2, 10 % CO 2, and 86 % N 2) at 37 °C overnight in 250 ml Tryptone-Yeast-Glucose (TYG) broth, and grown to an 00600 0. 9 - 1. 1. Cells were harvested and washed for microencapsulation using centrifugation. Microencapsulation of the organism was done using a mono-axial extrusion technique together with a superposed airflow, by manually extruding the aqueous gum I cell mix through a 27. 5 G bevelled needle, fitted on to a 10 ml syringe. The resultant microdroplets were hardened by free fall into 0. 1 M CaCI 2 solution. Microcapsules were separated from the CaCI 2 solution by filtration through Whatman No. 1 filter paper. All procedures were carried out in a laminar flow hood. Results indicated that the method of microencapsulation used in this study was successful. Using a concentrated inoculum of B. lactis, high numbers (lOglO 11 - 12 etu. g- 1) of bacteria were incorporated into the microcapsules. Therefore the daily intake would be provided by 0. 1 g microcapsules. The diameter and size distribution of microcapsules were determined by laser diffractometry. This showed a maximum microcapsule diameter of 2. 22 mm with 50 % (w/v) of the microcapsules having a diameter of 0. 05) at either temperature after 21 days. Hence this form of storage could be used to deliver viable immobilised B. lactis to the food industry. In order to assess the survival of immobilised B. lactis in the GIT, the microcapsules were incubated at 37 °C over a period of 240 min in simulated gastric juice (SGJ) (pH 1. 5). Viable counts were performed by sampling at regular intervals. A similar study was done in simulated bile and pancreatic juices (BPJ) (pH 6. 5). In SGJ, it was demonstrated that there was a significant reduction (3 log cycles) (p 0. 05) was noted for surviving fractions of both immobilised and free B. lactis. Commercial pasteurised amasi (pH 4. 4) and mahewu (pH 3. 5) were selected as the supply vehicles for the microencapsulated B. lactis. Known numbers of viable microencapsulated and free B. lactis cells were added to both beverages. For most samples, incubation was at either 4 °C or 22 °C for 21 days in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. In addition, free cells were incubated anaerobically at 22 °C. As oxygen is limiting in the microcapsules, these were not incubated under anaerobic conditions. The survival I shelf-life studies of commercial amasi indicated no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in survival rate between immobilised and free B. lactis cells. The reduction noted for viable counts of immobilised or free B. lactis cells was approximately 1. 5 log cycles. Even so, after 21 days viable immobilised B. lactis (1010 0. 1 g'l microcapsules) remained in excess of the daily intake 108, whereas in the free B. lactis cells, the viable count declined to 106 mr 1. Statistical analyses showed that temperature or oxygen presence had little effect on the survival of both immobilised or free B. lactis cells (p>O. 05). In mahewu, decline in viability of cells was observed for most samples. However microencapsulation enhanced cell survival at both 4 °C and 22 °C when compared to free cells. The decrease in viable B. lactis free cells occurred more rapidly (3 log cycles) in mahewu, than in amasi, at both 4 °C and 22 °C. Throughout the shelf-life studies it was apparent that viable B. lactis cell numbers did not increase. This was advantageous as metabolites associated with B. lactis growth would have adversely altered the taste of both amasi and mahewu. Sensory evaluation of the traditional fermented African beverages, enriched with either viable immobilised or free B. lactis, was done in order to determine consumer response to the product. An analytically trained 12 -member taste panel analysed the beverages for colour, texture, and taste. The triangle taste test procedure was used. No differences were detected with regard to texture, and colour of the fermented beverages containing immobilised B. lactis. However, in the fermented beverages containing free cells, a change in viscosity was noted. There was a significant difference (p<O. 05) recorded in flavour for both amasi and mahewu containing free B. lactis cells. In the two fermented beverages enriched with immobilised cells, significant (p<O. 05) flavour differences were detected in mahewu. However, this was not observed in the amasi samples containing immobilised B. lactis. Therefore, in order to retain the sensory properties of amasi, B. lactis should be supplied in microcapsules. In mahewu, although flavour differences noted were not unpleasant to the panellists, results from this study indicate that the use of commercial flavoured mahewu should be considered as a supply vehicle for microencapsulated B. lactis. Overall, this study demonstrated that immobilisation of B. lactis in gellan-xanthan gum is possible. Microcapsules produced contained high numbers of viable B. lactis, and were suitable for incorporation into soft foods. The gel matrix significantly protected viable cells from harsh conditions associated with SGJ. Although the surviving fraction of immobilised cells, when compared to free cells, was not improved in amasi samples, it is recommended that for technological reasons associated with production of amasi, microencapsulation should be used. In mahewu, microencapsulation enhanced B. lactis survival at both 4 °C and 22 °C. Therefore immobilisation of B. lactis in mahewu is necessary {{in order to maintain the}} daily intake. Immobilised B. lactis should be incorporated into both beverages after fermentation, and pasteurisation...|$|R

[...] Using MA medium, growth rates are not particularly fast, with a doubling time (the time it takes a culture of microbes to double in cells per unit volume) of approximately 32 hours. [...] By using the more optimal medium MA2, this {{can be reduced to}} 24 hours. [...] Culturing is done at 42 °C under white fluorescent light with an approximate intensity of 50 µmol photons m−2 s−1 (µE). [...] However, under a higher light intensity of 90 µE with 5% CO2 applied through bubbling, the growth rate of C. merolae can be further increased, with a doubling time of approximately 9.2 hours. [...] Higher light is not necessarily beneficial, as above 90 µE the growth rate begins to decrease. This may be due to photodamage occurring to the photosynthetic apparatus. C. merolae can also be grown on <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> plates for purposes of colony selection or strain maintenance in the laboratory. [...] C. merolae is an obligate oxygenic phototroph, meaning it is not capable of taking up fixed carbon from its environment and must rely on oxygenic photosynthesis to fix carbon from CO2.|$|E

The <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> medium supported the growth of all 18 leptospiral strains studied which included an array of serovars with various fastidious growth characteristics. <b>Gellan</b> <b>gum</b> medium was also used advantageously as a long-term maintenance medium; 9 - to 12 -month-old cultures still contained viable organisms. The colonial growth in <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> plating medium of six representative strains was consistent with previously described colonial growth on agar plating media. In addition, <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> medium {{appeared to be an}} excellent medium for the recovery of leptospires from the blood, liver, and kidneys of hamsters experimentally infected with a virulent Leptospira interrogans serovar bataviae strain.

The results revealed that glucose was the best carbon source and that the optimal concentration was 30 g liter− 1. As for the fermenting parameters, considerably large amounts of <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> were yielded by an 8 -h-old culture and a 4 % inoculum at 200 rpm on a rotary shaker. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum level of <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> (14. 75 g liter− 1) and the highest conversion efficiency (49. 17 %) were obtained in a 30 -liter fermentor in batch fermentation. Logistic and Luedeking-Piret models were confirmed to provide a good description of <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> fermentation, which gave some support for the study of <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> fermentation kinetics. Additionally, this study is the first demonstration that <b>gellan</b> <b>gum</b> production is largely growth associated by analysis of kinetics in its batch fermentation process.
