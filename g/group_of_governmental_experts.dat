40|$|The idea {{of using}} remote sensing imagery as {{off-site}} measure of BWC compliance is nothing new. The Third BWC Review Conference in 1991 established an Ad Hoc <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Governmental</b> <b>Experts</b> known as the VEREX(*) Group that examined the use of remote sensing imagery as one of 21 identified individual measures(**). One {{of the most recent}} reports, authored by Meier in 2006 (***), aimed at reassessing the value of airborne imagery for verifying BWC compliance taking into account the state-of-the-art of remote sensing technologies at that time. Meier expected remote monitoring from satellites or aircraft to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of other means verifying BWC compliance and emphasized the value of remote sensing in support of on-site measures and in assessing the correctness and completeness of information on bioweapons-related activities. Since then, the development of remote sensing and geoinformation technologies has continued to stride ahead. Today, airborne and satellite imaging sensors provide far better spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and 3 D capabilities than some years ago. Video scenes acquired over an area of interest for up to 90 seconds will become commercially available from space soon. At the same time, also methods for processing remote sensing imagery as well as geoinformation technologies (with Google Earth as probably best-known example) for visualizing and integrating remote sensing information have advanced with regard to automation, user-friendliness and public availability. Given this trend towards better imagery quality, increasing availability and easier use it is necessary to look again at remote sensing, together with geoinformation technologies, and examine whether the potential role of these technologies for verifying BWC compliance may have changed. The issue will be addressed in three parts: The first part reviews the latest developments of remote sensing and geoinformation technologies that are relevant in the BWC context. The second part explains how state-of-the-art remote sensing and geoinformation technologies may be used in support of other measures, such as confidence building, inspections and continuous monitoring. The third part discusses to what extend these technologies could be used to directly extract observables and signatures of possible non-compliance with the BWC. * Ad Hoc <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Governmental</b> <b>Experts</b> to Identify and Examine Potential Verification Measures from a Scientific and Technical Standpoint** VEREX Report, BWC/CONF.

Thus, IRPs provide alternative risk financing and transfer mechanisms to their members through self-funding, where particular types of risk are underwritten with contributions (premiums), with losses and expenses shared in agreed ratios. In other words, Intergovernmental Risk Pools are a cooperative <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>governmental</b> entities joining together through written agreement to finance an exposure, liability or risk. Although they are not considered insurance, these pools extend nearly identical coverage through similar underwriting and claim activities, as well as provide other risk management services.

40|$|While {{the weapons}} of state armed forces are not the largest major small arms category—civilian small arms appear to outnumber their {{military}} counterparts worldwide by over three to one—they are a serious factor in conflict and violence, and the focus of much international small arms diplomacy (Small Arms Survey, 2006, pp. 37 – 38). Military-owned small arms also constitute the world’s largest centrally controlled stockpiles, forming the content of massive transfers and raising vital control issues (Small Arms Survey, 2004, p. 54). As this Research Note shows, despite their reputation for military secrecy, governments sometimes reveal their military small arms holdings. Based on these acknowledged holdings, estimating methods permit the calculation of approximate military-owned small arms totals for other countries. These sources and methods show that state militaries worldwide hold roughly 200 million small arms, {{out of a total}} of some 875 million firearms of all kinds worldwide (Small Arms Survey, 2007). Almost 25 per cent of the global military total belongs to just 2 countries, while 50 per cent belongs to 20 countries (see Figure 1 and Table 4). The totals owned by particular countries have changed since 2007, with global military procurement of newly manufactured weapons apparently outstripping surplus destruction (Karp, 2010, p. 4). Consequently, these totals must be used with caution and updated where possible. This Research Note complements others on estimations of civilian and law enforcement Figure 1. The largest reported and estimated military-owned small arms inventories small arms holdings (Small Arms Survey, 2011; 2012). The armed forces covered here are military services, typically under ministries of defence, not civilian law enforcement agencies or paramilitary agencies under other ministries.
