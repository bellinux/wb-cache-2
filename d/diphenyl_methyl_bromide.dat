40|$|Abstract Background Although ozone-depleting <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> {{was destined}} for {{phase-out}} by 2005, {{it is still}} widely applied {{as a consequence of}} various critical-use-exemptions and mandatory international regulations aiming to restrict the spread of pests and alien species (e. g. in globalized transport and storage). The withdrawal of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> because of its environmental risk could fortuitously help in the containment of its human toxicity. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature, including in vitro toxicological and epidemiological studies of occupational and community exposure to the halogenated hydrocarbon pesticide <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> We focused on toxic (especially chronic) or carcinogenic effects from the use of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> on biomonitoring data and reference values. Eligible epidemiological studies were subjected to meta-analysis. Results Out of the 542 peer reviewed publications between 1990 - 2011, we found only 91 referring to toxicity of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> and 29 using the term "carcinogenic", "neoplastic" or "mutagenic". Several studies provide new additional data pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> toxicity. Few studies have performed a detailed exposure assessment including biomonitoring. Three evaluated epidemiological studies assessed a possible association between cancer and <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> Overall, exposure to <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer OR, 1. 21; 95 % CI (0, 98 - 1. 49), P = 0. 076. Two epidemiological studies have analyzed environmental, non-occupational exposure to <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> providing evidence for its health risk to the general public. None of the epidemiological studies addressed its use as a fumigant in freight containers, although recent field and case reports do refer to its toxic effects associated with its use in shipping and storage. Conclusion s Both the epidemiological evidence and toxicological data suggest a possible link between <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> exposure and serious health problems, including prostate cancer risk from occupational and community exposure. The environmental risks of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide</b> are not in doubt, but also its health risks, especially for genetically predisposed subjects, should not be underestimated. </p...|$|R

Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol there is a ten-year grace period for developing countries to allow the transfer of technology that will permit ozone-depleting chemicals to be phased out. Consideration will need to be given to the availability of alternative pest management techniques that might be introduced. For soil treatment there is unlikely to be a single alternative to the broad spectrum of activity of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide,</b> and a combination of techniques, including chemicals, may be necessary. The greatest problem, however, may lie in finding an alternative to quarantine fumigations, where short-period treatments are essential. Two-hour treatments are commonly employed for perishables such as fruit and cut flowers and it may be that, where no alternatives can be found, special consideration will have to be given to the indefinite retention of <b>methyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> Systems would need to be developed to recover the fumigant, either for recirculation or chemical breakdown with nil emission to the atmosphere.
