5000|$|Ceramography evolved {{along with}} other {{branches}} of materialography and ceramic engineering. Alois de Widmanstätten of Austria etched a meteorite in 1808 to reveal proeutectoid ferrite bands that grew on prior austenite grain boundaries. Geologist Henry Clifton Sorby, the [...] "father of metallography," [...] applied petrographic techniques to the steel industry in the 1860s in Sheffield, England. [...] French geologist Auguste Michel-Lévy devised a chart that correlated the optical properties of minerals to their transmitted color and thickness in the 1880s. Swedish metallurgist J.A. Brinell invented the first quantitative hardness scale in 1900. [...] Smith and Sandland developed the first microindention hardness test at Vickers Ltd. in London in 1922. [...] Swiss-born microscopist A.I. Buehler started the first metallographic equipment manufacturer near Chicago in 1936. Frederick Knoop and colleagues at the National Bureau of Standards developed a less-penetrating (than Vickers) microindention test in 1939. [...] Struers A/S of Copenhagen introduced the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>polisher</b> to metallography in 1943. George Kehl of Columbia University wrote a book that was considered the bible of materialography until the 1980s. [...] Kehl co-founded a group within the Atomic Energy Commission that became the International Metallographic Society in 1967.|$|E
