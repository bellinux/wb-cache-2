5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car. He looks in and sees her {{sleeping}} in his bedroom, {{but he does}} not wake her. He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself for a long moment.|$|E
500|$|Eva is hospitalized and {{learns that}} she has cancer. She declines the {{position}} of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast {{to the people of}} Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the [...] "brightest fire", and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ché is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{appears in}} the video as a hooded wizard who enters an Egyptian palace and {{attempts}} to entertain the Pharaoh's bored Queen. Two other entertainers have failed, and she has sent them to be executed. The Queen sees that this wizard is different — instead of juggling or eating fire, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> the steps to her throne and sings to her, asking her if she [...] "remembers the time" [...] they were together. The Pharaoh (played by Murphy) hardly appreciates this move and summons his guards. Jackson runs away to another room and begins elaborate, Egyptian-style choreography with the Pharaoh's servants. When the guards find him, Jackson [...] turns into golden sand. [...] In the video, Jackson {{was dressed in a}} costume made of gold satin. He wore golden chain mail, a white skirt with a phallic dangling sash, black pants and black boots. This video features a physically complicated dance routine that became the centerpiece of other videos from the Dangerous album.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the play}} the two theatre critics discuss things they may write about this typical whodunit, {{but they are}} often sidetracked by their soliloquies, Moon's {{concerning}} his professional jealousy of Higgs and Birdboot's concerning his newly found [...] "love", the actress playing Cynthia. As they talk, the telephone on stage begins to ring incessantly until Moon cannot stand it any more. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> on stage to answer it {{only to discover that}} Birdboot's wife, Myrtle, is on the line. Birdboot speaks to her and as he hangs up, the play suddenly starts again and he gets trapped in it, mistaken for Simon, leading to his inevitable demise as he executes the role to its end, just after recognising the dead body onstage as Higgs, the first string critic who was unavailable that night. Moon ascends the stage to unravel Birdboot's death, taking on the role of Inspector Hound. Major Magnus accuses Moon of being the madman, since he is not the real Inspector Hound, and he tries to run but Magnus shoots him. As Moon lies dying on the floor, Magnus reveals himself to not only be the real Inspector Hound but also Cynthia's lost husband, Albert, who had disappeared ten years earlier. Moon, however, also recognises him as third-string critic Puckeridge, who will now become the first-string as both Higgs and Moon are out of the way.|$|E

6000|$|MORELL (with quaint desperation, {{clutching}} {{himself by}} the hair). Eugene: {{my head is}} spinning round. I shall begin to laugh presently. (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and {{down the middle of}} the room.) ...|$|E

60|$|Number seven {{he found}} to be as quiet and decent a house as any in the row, and having {{inspected}} it from a little distance <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> briskly to the door, and rang the bell. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> briskly in order that his advance might not be seen; unless, indeed, {{as he began to}} think not impossible, Aby's statement was altogether a hoax.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is the tramp of a sentry outside. I suppose <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the whole length of the six casemates. I counted them as we came in. We are at one end, which, of course, is an advantage." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But dear Tom is an {{excellent}} nurse; and many and many a night has he had no sleep, dear man! in consequence of the poor little baby. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down with it FOR HOURS, singing a kind of song (dear fellow, he has no more voice than a tea-kettle), and bobbing his head backwards and forwards, and looking, in his nightcap and dressing-gown, SO DROLL. Oh, Eliza! how you would laugh to see him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Little Bear {{stands up}} in his chief's dress, and laughs again. 'But, white man Jeff,' he goes on, 'the paleface {{provides}} a recourse. 'Tis a temporary one, but it gives a respite {{and the name of}} it is whiskey.' And straight off <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> the path to town again. 'Now,' says I in my mind, 'may the Manitou move him to do only bailable things this night!' For I perceive that John Tom is about to avail himself of the white man's solace.|$|E
60|$|We rode along {{close to}} his hedge a short distance, and he marched with us, {{brushing}} against the hedge and showing an anxious desire to get at us. If {{there had been a}} gap in that hedge he would have charged like a thunderbolt, but there was no gap, and it is a strange fact that an ostrich cannot leap--at least he will not. The merest trifle of an obstruction--a bit of wall or hedge over which he could step with perfect ease--is sufficient to check his advance and keep him in; that is, if <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to it, but he is a stupid bird, and if he runs up to such an obstruction he may tumble over it, gather himself up on the other side, and so continue the charge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he not?" [...] {{answered}} Tiefel, [...] "then I {{will show}} you a mistake. You recall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there, and he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered. Now up gets your General Sherman {{in the middle of}} the night,--midnight,--and marches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms. So, says he, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here, and this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool. Is not that crazy? So <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down for three eternal hours. Says he, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at Sedalia with his regiments all over the place. They must both go into camp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops may be handled.'" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{the general}} {{is an old}} bachelor, and an old beau, {{and there are several}} ladies at the Hall, {{especially}} his quondam flame Lady Jocelyne, he is put rather upon his gallantry. He commonly passes some time, therefore, at his toilette, and takes the field at a late hour every morning, with his hair dressed out and powdered, and a rose in his button-hole. After he has breakfasted, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down the terrace in the sunshine, humming an air, and hemming between every stave, carrying one hand behind his back, and with the other touching his cane to the ground, and then raising it up to his shoulder. Should he, in these morning promenades, meet any of the elder ladies of the family, as he frequently does Lady Lillycraft, his hat is immediately in his hand, and it is enough to remind one of those courtly groups of ladies and gentlemen, in old prints of Windsor terrace, or Kensington garden.|$|E
60|$|They {{not only}} steal from white men, but tribes {{that are at}} enmity steal from each other, and the boldness with which they do this is most remarkable. When Indians are {{travelling}} {{in a country where}} enemies are prowling, they guard their camps at night with jealous care. The horses in particular are both hobbled and picketed, and sentries are posted all round the camp. Yet, in spite of these precautions, hostile Indians manage to elude the sentries, and creep into the camp. When a thief thus succeeds in effecting an entrance, his chief danger is past. He rises boldly to his feet, and, wrapping his blanket or buffalo robe round him, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> and down {{as if he were a}} member of the tribe. At the same time he dexterously cuts the laryats of such horses as he observes are not hobbled. He dare not stoop to cut the hobbles, as the action would be observed, and suspicion would be instantly aroused. He then leaps on the best horse he can find, and uttering a terrific war-whoop darts away into the plains, driving the loosened horses before him.|$|E
60|$|In {{the matter}} of {{sculpture}} almost all the Brussels churches are decorated with the most laborious wooden pulpits, which may be worth their weight in gold, too, for what I know, including his reverence preaching inside. At St. Gudule the preacher mounts into no less a place than the garden of Eden, being supported by Adam and Eve, by Sin and Death, and numberless other animals; <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>up</b> to his desk by a rustic railing of flowers, fruits, and vegetables, with wooden peacocks, paroquets, monkeys biting apples, and many more of the birds and beasts of the field. In another church the clergyman speaks from out a hermitage; in a third from a carved palm-tree, which supports a set of oak clouds that form the canopy of the pulpit, and are, indeed, not much heavier in appearance than so many huge sponges. A priest, however tall or stout, must {{be lost in the}} midst of all these queer gimcracks; in order to be consistent, they ought to dress him up, too, in some odd fantastical suit. I can fancy the Cure of Meudon preaching out of such a place, or the Rev. Sydney Smith, or that famous clergyman of the time of the League, who brought all Paris to laugh and listen to him.|$|E
