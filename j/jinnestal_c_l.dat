50|$|For Eurasia, in 1995 mammalogist Robert Nowak {{recognized}} five subspecies from Eurasia {{based on}} skull morphology; <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lupus, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> albus, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> pallipes, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> cubanensis and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> communis. In 2003, Nowak also recognized the distinctiveness of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> , <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> hattai, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> hodophilax and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lupaster. In 2005, MSW3 included <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> filchneri. In 2003, two forms were distinguished in southern China and Inner Mongolia as being separate from <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> chanco and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> filchneri and {{have yet to}} be named.|$|R
500|$|... 19 {{subspecies}} are recognized. Geographic {{variation in}} coyotes is not great, though {{taken as a}} whole, the eastern subspecies (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> thamnos and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> frustor) are large, dark-colored animals, with a gradual paling in color and reduction in size westward and northward (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> texensis, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> latrans, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lestes, and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> incolatus), a brightening of ochraceous tones–deep orange or brown–towards the Pacific coast (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> ochropus, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> umpquensis), a reduction in size in the Southwestern United States (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> microdon, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> mearnsi) and a general trend towards dark reddish colors and short muzzles in Mexican and Central American populations.|$|R
50|$|Two {{additional}} subspecies, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nattereri and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> vitalinus, {{are sometimes}} recognised, {{but have been}} considered to be junior synonyms of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lanatus and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> ochropus, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Responses {{of cells}} in the parvocellular (p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.)</b> and magnocellular (m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.)</b> layers of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus to sine-wave {{gratings}} were studied. Both p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> and m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells responded best at a temporal frequency (drift rate) of 10 - 20 Hz. P. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells responded at temporal frequencies lower than 1 Hz; m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells did not. With coloured- or white-black luminance-modulated gratings, responses of m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells were weaker at low than at medium spatial frequencies. With coloured gratings, p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cell responses were not attenuated at low spatial frequencies. With white gratings a few p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells did show such attenuation. Optimal responses from p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells were obtained with coloured gratings; white gratings evoked weaker responses. With a grating of a colour causing suppression of a p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cell's activity, the modulation of firing was much less than with a grating of a colour excitatory for the cell. M. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> on- and off-centre cells responded equally well to moving gratings. The ability of p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells to resolve fine gratings was dependent on cell type {{as well as on}} the colour of grating used. The ability of m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells to resolve fine gratings was comparable to that of p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells. The contrast sensitivity of m. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells was much higher than that of p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells. This may account for their ability to resolve fine gratings, despite their larger centre size. In comparison with luminance-modulated gratings, chromatically modulated gratings could evoke larger or smaller responses, depending on p. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cell type and the colours in the grating. M. <b>c.</b> <b>l.</b> cells responded poorly or not at all...|$|R
5000|$|There remains taxonomic {{confusion}} over the Mongolian wolf. In 1941, Pocock had {{referred to the}} Tibetan wolf as <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> laniger and classified it as a synonym under <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> chanco. However, Wozencraft included <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> laniger as a synonym for <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> filchneri Matschie (1907). There are some researchers who still refer to Pocock's classification of the Tibetan wolf as <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> chanco, which has caused taxonomic confusion. The NCBI/Genbank lists <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> chanco [...] as the Mongolian wolf and separately <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> laniger as the Tibetan wolf, and there are academic works that refer to <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> chanco as the Mongolian wolf.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{specimens of}} five subspecies of gray wolves from southwestern North America and assessed their systematic affinities using both univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Because wolves exhibit considerable sexual dimorphism the sexes were separated for the analyses. Principal components analyses revealed considerable overlap among the individuals, but tended {{to separate the}} Mexican wolf (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi) from northern wolves (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> youngi). Specimens from other subspecies were intermediate to these two. Discriminant function analyses using various groupings of wolves supported these results. Within the southwestern part of North America, we recognize only three subspecies: <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> youngi, and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus. Wolves formerly assigned to <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> mogollonensis and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> monstrabilis are referred to <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi. As an adjunct to our study, we compared recently collected specimens and captive animals with target groups from the southwest. Recent specimens show clear affinities with <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi. Captives, although closest to baileyi, show some tendencies. toward dogs, but whether these tendencies are from hybridization or {{from the effects of}} captivity is unknown...|$|R

40|$|The rock rattlesnakes Crotalus lepidus {{comprise}} a group (lepidus, klauberi, morulus and maculosus) of poorly known mountain cold-tolerant snakes in Mexico. In particular, Crotalus lepidus morulus is a snake endemic {{of the northeast}} of Mexico, whereas Crotalus lepidus klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus are distributed in some regions of the north and central Mexico and southern U. S. Until now very little data are available from C. lepidus subspecies from Mexico, as the terrain inhabited by these snakes is generally steep and rugged. In this work, we have determined some biochemical and biological properties of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus crude venoms. Some minor differences in venoms were noted in SDS-PAGE, HPLC profile and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Partial sequences of metalloproteinases, phospholipases A 2 (PLA 2) and galactose-specific lectins were identified in the venoms. Venoms of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus had significantly higher hemorrhagic and lethal activities than <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus venom. Proteolytic activity in azocasein was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus venom, whereas gelatin hydrolysis was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi. Fibrinogenolytic and PLA 2 activities were very similar in all venoms tested. The histological observations in the gastrocnemius muscle damaged by venoms from all the subspecies confirmed myonecrotic and hemorrhagic activities (at 3 and 24 h), {{which resulted in a}} poor regenerative response after 14 days. However, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi venom induced a higher increase in the plasma activity of creatine kinase (CK), evidencing higher myotoxicity, whereas paw edema-inducing activity was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus venom. The results indicate that the venoms from the three subspecies have similar protein profiles in electrophoresis, HPLC and molecular weight determinations. However, differences were found in the biological activities in mice. Notably, the venoms of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi present higher toxicity (lower LD 50) and hemorrhagic activity than <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus venom.

50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1823 by Thomas Say {{in his writings}} on Major Stephen Long's expedition to the Great Plains. Though currently recognized by taxonomists as a distinct subspecies, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus {{is the most difficult}} North American gray wolf to evaluate, as it {{has a long history of}} being in contact and interbreeding with other gray wolf populations (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> occidentalis), eastern wolves, red wolves and also hybridizing with eastern/red wolf-coyote hybrids. It has long been suspected that hybrizations with eastern wolves may have resulted in coyote genes being transmitted into the <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus population in the western Great Lake regions since unlike the red wolves and eastern wolves, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus are not known to directly hybridize with pure coyotes. <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus likely crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America after the more basal <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi, pushing the latter subspecies southwards as it expanded its range. By the last ice age, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus was gradually displaced from its northwestern range by the newly arrived <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> occidentalis, a process which has continued till present times.|$|R

Phylogenetic analyses of North American gray wolves show that there are three clades corresponding to <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> occidentalis, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi, each one representing a separate invasion into North America from distinct Eurasian ancestors. <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> occidentalis, the most northwestern subspecies, is descended from the last gray wolves to colonize North America. It likely crossed into North America through the Bering land bridge after the last ice age, displacing <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> nubilus populations as it advanced, a process which has continued till present times.|$|R
