During the testing, it appeared {{that each of the}} three single-phase units had experienced a voltage breakdown, one externally and two internally. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) was asked by DOE to restore the operation of the fault current controller provided the HTS coils had not been damaged during the initial substation tests. When the internally-failed coil vacuum vessels were opened it became evident that in these two vessels, a flashover had occurred at the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bus</b> section leading to the terminals of the superconducting coil.

40|$|AbstractThe power {{electronic}} subsystems within electric vehicle (EV) powertrains {{are required to}} manage both the energy flows within the vehicle and the delivery of torque by the electrical machine. Such systems are known to generate undesired electrical noise on the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bus.</b> High frequency current oscillations, or ripple, if unhindered will enter the vehicle’s battery system. Real-world measurements of the current on the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bus</b> of a series hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) show that significant current perturbations ranging from 10 Hz to in excess of 10 kHz are present. Little is reported within the academic literature about the potential impact on battery system performance {{and the rate of}} degradation associated with exposing the battery to coupled direct current (DC) and alternating currents (AC). This paper documents an experimental investigation that studies the long-term impact of current ripple on battery performance degradation. Initial results highlight that both capacity fade and impedance rise progressively increase as the frequency of the superimposed AC current increases. A further conclusion is that the spread of degradation for cells cycled with a coupled AC–DC signal is considerably more than for cells exercised with a traditional DC waveform. The underlying causality for this degradation is not yet understood. However, this has important implications for the battery management system (BMS). Increased variations in cell capacity and impedance will cause differential current flows and heat generation within the battery pack that if not properly managed will further reduce battery life and degrade the operation of the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. A bi-directional, direct {{conversion}} switch-mode converter is proposed {{for use in}} distributed household renewable energy systems. The converter is intended as the central interface between the household energy system’s low <b>voltage</b> Direct Current <b>bus</b> and the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> Alternating Current <b>bus.</b> The low <b>voltage</b> DC <b>bus</b> is connected to renewable generation and storage devices, while the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> AC <b>bus</b> {{is connected to the}} user’s equipment and the mains grid. The converter overcomes the inherent reverse-duty cycle problem associated with bi-directional converters by using a combination step-up / step-down half-bridge converter on the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> side of a high frequency transformer. The low voltage side of the transformer is driven by a full bridge inverter that acts as a rectifier during reverse mode. In order to control the flow of power in both directions the converter implements Average Current Mode Control. A method is developed to determine the transfer functions of common switch-mode converters by inspection alone. This method is applied to the proposed converter, and both current and voltage mode control loops are designed with the frequency response method. The control system is implemented using a Digital Signal Processor. A method of simultaneously simulating both the converter hardware and software is developed using VHDL. This method greatly reduced the development effort of the converter. The operation of the proposed converter is verified through this method of simulation. A prototype converter is constructed and successfully tested, thereby proving the viability of the proposed converter topology and control methodology...|$|R

Unlike current, which can be trivially measured without a ground connection at the measuring point, voltage requires a ground connection.

However, since current can be measured at line potential, simply by using a current transformer around the conductor and transmitting the readings through wireless or a fiber-optic cable, the design of a device that can measure both the current and voltage wave forms while operating at the bus potential would be of great use in smart grid applications where many measurement points are required and the cost of classical, transformer or capacitive divider installations is prohibitive.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} concept of a small, low-cost, self-powered smart wireless sensor {{that can be used for}} monitoring current, temperature and voltage on a variety of utility assets. Novel energy harvesting approaches are proposed that enable the sensor to operate without batteries and to have an expected life of 20 - 30 years. The sensor measures current flowing in an asset using an open ferromagnetic core, unlike a CT which uses a closed core, which makes the proposed sensor small in size, and low-cost. Further, it allows the sensor to operate in conjunction with different assets having different geometries, such as bus-bars, cables, disconnect switches, overhead conductors, transformers, and shunt capacitors, and function even when kept in the vicinity of an asset. Two novel current sensing algorithms have been developed that help the sensor to autonomously calibrate and make the sensor immune from far-fields and cross-talk. The current sensing algorithms have been implemented and tested in the lab at up to 1000 A. This research also presents a novel self-calibrating low-cost voltage sensing technique. The major purpose of voltage sensing is detection of sags, swells and loss-ofpower on the asset; therefore, the constraint on error in measurement is relaxed. The technique has been tested through several simulation studies. A voltage sensor prototype has been developed and tested on a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bus</b> at up to 35 kV. Finally, a study of sensor operation under faults, such as lightning strikes, and large short circuit currents has been presented.

Issues related to corona and external electrical noise on the communication network are also discussed and experimentally tested.
