5|$|On September1, 1982, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} County Route51 (CR51) from CR110 north to US11 in Winthrop was transferred from St. Lawrence County {{to the state of}} New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Also transferred to the state as part of the swap was CR110 itself, an east–west highway extending from Stockholm Center to Coteys Corner. The segment of CR51 given to New York became a southward extension of NY420, which now began at NY11C (former CR110) and briefly overlapped US11 in Winthrop. The alignments of US11 and NY11C between Stockholm Center and Coteys Corner were <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> June13, 1992.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lottah, Tasmania, on 17September 1903, Alan Charlesworth {{was the son}} of a storeman, Edwin Charlesworth, and {{his wife}} Louisa. The youth {{attended}} Lottah Public School and St Virgil's College, Hobart, before entering the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1920. He won the Silver Boomerang trophy, awarded to the college's champion athlete, three years running in 1921–23. In 1923 he was appointed company sergeant major at Duntroon, and received the Sword of Honour upon graduating as a lieutenant later that year. Following service as adjutant and quartermaster with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment in Queensland, Charlesworth transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flying officer on 27January 1925. Among his classmates on the 1925 pilots' course at Point Cook, Victoria, was fellow Duntroon graduate Frederick Scherger. During a training flight on 25March, Charlesworth's Avro 504K stalled and spun into a field, injuring him and killing his instructor. Recovering, he was subsequently involved in an accident with future lieutenant general and Governor of New South Wales Eric Woodward, when their plane <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> landing and came to rest upside down on a fence; neither man was badly hurt.|$|E

25|$|The current {{alignment}} of NY11C was originally part of US11. An alternate route of then-US11 between Stockholm Center and Coteys Corner that bypassed the Brasher Falls {{area to the}} south {{was added to the}} state highway system on September1, 1982, and designated as NY11C. The alignments of US11 and NY11C between the two hamlets were <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> June13, 1992, placing both routes on their current routings.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2016, Uber {{began using}} {{self-driving}} Volvo XC90 SUVs in its hometown of San Francisco. On December 21, 2016, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration of the 16 vehicles Uber was using {{for the test}} and forced the program to cease operations in California. Uber then moved the program to Arizona, where the cars are picking up passengers, albeit with 2 Uber engineers in the front seats as a safety precaution. In March 2017, an Uber self-driving car was <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> its side by a vehicle which failed to yield.|$|E
25|$|The {{detonation}} {{turned the}} TNT into {{a mass of}} highly pressurized gas and produced a large fireball and mushroom shaped cloud. The resulting crater was 240 feet across and within minutes partially filled with water. Unexpectedly, the crater also had a central updraft similar to moon craters which resulted in much speculation by the scientists. Many target objects were moved and damaged by the overpressure blast, especially the heavy rockets, and two M113 armored personnel carriers were <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> their side. After the test, a full {{cross section of the}} crater was excavated to analyze the effects below ground.|$|E

Although it was introduced to Enter Shikari as a set design for their live shows, {{they thought it would}} be a [...] "solid symbol" [...] for the album. Guitarist Rory Clewlow described the cover art: [...] "Our society is often depicted as a pyramid, with the few at the top with all the wealth and the masses at the bottom with no wealth, but supporting the pyramid for the few at the top. Our upside down triangle represents this system being <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> [...] head." ...|$|E

What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E

500|$|Of the ten tornadoes in Florida, {{three were}} spawned in the {{southern}} portions of the state. In The Acreage, an EF-1 tornado caused minor to moderate roof damage to several homes, mainly {{in the form of}} shingles and roof covering torn off. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped near the trunk, along with several branches falling; this resulted in broken windows in several homes. At one home, the garage door was damaged, causing the door to blow in, which in turn led to the roof being damaged above the garage. An 85-year-old woman was injured after being struck by a falling branch of an oak tree, which broke through her bedroom window. A few vehicles were moved from their original locations, while a [...] boat was <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> its side. Another tornado in Belle Glade damaged an awning and downed trees and several power lines. Further south, a tornado touched down in Broward County and entered Palm Beach County before lifting back up; it resulted in no damage.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{remained}} at Wei Hai Wei {{until the end}} of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for Hankow. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government's survey of the massive flooding in the area. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were also in the city to survey the flooding with their Lockheed Sirius float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted back into the water by Hermess crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. Hermes received a distress message on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS Ryinjin Maru, that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland {{at the mouth of the}} Taiwan Strait. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the [...] and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon <b>flipped</b> <b>on</b> the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
