25|$|According to Governing, Cities and Localities section More commonly, central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working {{downtown}} – {{known as}} commuter taxes – as property tax bases dwindle. Taken together, {{these two groups}} of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities may begin to target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling.

[...] He praised the action sequence, calling it [...] "truly inspired" [...] and [...] "extremely well scripted", and graded the episode 8.9 out of 10. Brad Trechak of TV Squad stated that [...] "the pirate segment of the episode wasn't very good and seemed out of place", though he also praised the action scene. He enjoyed the plot line about Chris and Anna, and called the episode [...] "a high note". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "the pirate gag was fine enough, in that it resulted in an amusing land-battle sequence" [...] and [...] "Chris' storyline resulted {{in some of the}} best Family Guy laughs I've had in a while".

The collection, described by The Times as [...] "very clever" [...] despite their [...] "quiet hope that [...] would become tangled at the first hemp-woven hurdle", was widely publicised in magazines such as Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and People. Watson, who was not paid for the collaboration, admitted that competition for the range was minimal, but argued that [...] "Fashion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> empower people and give them skills; rather than give cash to charity you can help people by buying the clothes they make and supporting things they take pride in"; adding, [...] "I think young people like me are becoming increasingly aware of the humanitarian issues surrounding fast fashion and want to make good choices but there aren't many options out there." [...] Watson continued her involvement with People Tree, resulting in the release of a 2010 Autumn/Winter collection.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly {{involved}} pop influenced R. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> start the record, because it is emotional and it kind of speaks directly to the questions people might have about the last year of her life. It's a good idea to get that {{out of the way and}} move on to happy, less emotional songs." ...|$|E

Fehn briefly addressed the Blythe situation, stating [...] "I think, especially in America, moshing has turned into a form of bullying. The big guy stands in the middle and just trucks any small kid that comes near him. They don’t mosh properly anymore. It sucks because that’s not what it’s about. Those guys need to be kicked out.

2500|$|The game's name, Hearthstone, {{was meant}} to imply to a close {{gathering}} of friends by a hearth, a goal {{of what they want}} players to feel. According to Chayes, they had experimented with other constructs of where these card games would take place, and only about halfway through development came onto the idea of using a pub's hearth as the theme; Chayes stated that with that concept, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> play, it works with all our values, {{it has a lot of}} charm". To maintain a friendly environment around this construct, they added in the ability to trigger one of a few friendly compliments that can be said by a hero, so that players could still emote to their opponent without having to worry about any vitriol.|$|E
2500|$|All major {{religions}} accept {{organ donation}} {{in at least}} some form on either utilitarian grounds (i.e., because of its life-saving capabilities) or deontological grounds (e.g., the right of an individual believer to make his or her own decision). Most religions, among them the Roman Catholic Church, support organ donation {{on the grounds that it}} constitutes an act of charity and provides a means of saving a life, consequently Pope Francis is an organ donor. One religious group, The Jesus Christians, became known as [...] "The Kidney Cult" [...] because more than half its members had donated their kidneys altruistically. Jesus Christians claim altruistic kidney donation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Do unto others what they would want you to do unto them." [...] Some religions impose certain restrictions on the types of organs that may be donated and/or on the means by which organs may be harvested and/or transplanted. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation of the Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament as prohibiting blood transfusion, and Muslims require that the donor have provided written consent in advance. A few groups disfavor organ transplantation or donation; notably, these include Shinto and those who follow the customs of the Gypsies.|$|E
