50|$|This {{structure}} {{is similar to}} other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them {{to be members of}} the IFAC <b>Forum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Firms</b> which is a network of accounting firm networks.|$|E
50|$|Recently {{one more}} {{slightly}} smaller exedra was found {{south on the}} wall bordering the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan. meaning that in sake of symmetry {{there must have been}} other exedra demolished {{to make room for the}} <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Nerva, rising the number to 4 and not 2 exedras. This completely changes the layout for the south part <b>of</b> the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Augustus, meaning that it is much more similar to the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan and a new theory for this southern part <b>of</b> the <b>forum</b> suggests that in fact there was a basilica between the 2 new exedras (like in the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan). This supports the numerous ancient authors that tell us the forum was used as a court of law.|$|R

50|$|In 75 AD, the Temple of Peace, {{also known}} as the <b>Forum</b> <b>of</b> Vespasian, was built under Emperor Vespasian.

The fact that this structure is not mentioned as having a civil function has prevented it from being classified as a true Forum. Therefore, the structure was simply identified as the Temple of Peace (Templum Pacis) until the late Empire.|$|R
