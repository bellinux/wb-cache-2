50|$|Disturbances are {{generally}} phrases {{to define a}} cause that creates an exposure in the vegetative skin, which leads to blowout formation. Rather being described as events, disturbances are terms to describe the rate that breaches create an opening and expand, yet there are numerous types of disturbances that can penetrate the protective vegetative skin. Despite {{the fact that many}} factors could influence blowout formations, disturbances usually have three characteristics to determine if a depression will form and expand. The first property states that disturbances must have a penetration magnitude greater than the toughness of the protective vegetative skin. Simply if the breach cannot remove the shielding vegetation wind erosion cannot create a depression in stabilized dunes. The second property asserts that sediment transportation in an exposure would be limited if exposure’s spatial coverage is too small. Presuming that the opening is very compacted, the <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> would also be very cramped which doesn’t allow much sediment particles to be moved out of the exposure. Lastly the third property exclaims that spatial configuration of the disturbed openings greatly influences the <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> and sediment transportation in the exposure. If there were numerous disturbed patches that borderline each other in a down wind direction, wind erosion may be capable of removing and transporting large amounts of sediment particles, which could create blowouts. Thus, although the scale of the disturbances does assist in blowout formation, these characteristics generally help dictate if Aeolian processes can create a depression or not.|$|E

The influence of changing shrub characteristics is investigated by performing a sequence of simulations with varying shrub heights and coverage.

50|$|The {{shoreline}} in the North and West of {{the lake}} remains substantially unaltered since deglaciation. Beaches have formed on the lake where rivers bring sediment to areas where the near shore relief is not too steep allowing pocket beaches to form. The beaches around the lake show many similarities to ocean shores. The shape {{of the lake}} funnels wind and waves down the long axis which leads to longshore transport or littoral drift of sediment and size selective sorting. There are however a number of differences to ocean shores. The short <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> produces a narrow range of wave conditions and this low energy limits the size of sediment in transport. Large changes to the beach profile are induced by fluctuations in lake level, major fluctuations can drown beaches. The beaches on the lake develop a distinctive shelf profile whereby beach sediments grade lakeward into fine sand. The {{outer edge of the}} shelf is marked by a shelf break and a transition to organic-rich muds on a steep offshore slope.

5000|$|The {{history of}} Twin Lakes Beach as a {{recreational}} area began around 1911 when Dr. Meindl built a hunting lodge, as hunting {{was the primary}} activity of the beach at the time. The lodge and others over time {{were used in the}} summer for fishing and holidays as well. About six or seven other medical doctors also used the area for hunting including Dr. Howden and Dr. Lambert. Over time Dr. Howden and Dr. Meindl acquired the land that comprises most of the present day beach from a local farmer with Dr. Howden acquiring over one mile of land in the Rural Municipality of Woodlands while Dr. Meindl acquired approximately 3 miles of land in the Rural Municipality of St. Laurent. It was after this time that the land was subdivided and many people began to purchase lakefront properties in the area initially mainly for summer homes and cottages, but also for permanent residences later on. Dr. Meindl donated 580 feet of beach front land for the local Metis people of St. Laurent for recreational use, which later became Meindl Park (French: Parc Meindl), named in his honour. [...] Prior to the flooding of 2011, the highest recorded water level on Lake Manitoba was during the summer of 1955 when the water level gauge at nearby Delta Beach recorded 816.32 feet above sea level, although the readings were subject to wind setup due to the long <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> of the lake to the north.

40|$|New {{gradient-based}} surface reconstruction {{techniques are}} presented: regularized least absolute deviations based methods using common discrete differential operators, and spline based methods. All new methods are formulated {{in the same}} mathematical framework as convex optimization problems and can handle non-rectangular domains. For the spline based methods, either common P-splines or P 1 -splines can be used. Extensive reconstruction error analysis shows that the new P 1 -spline based method is superior to conventional methods {{in the case of}} gradient fields corrupted with outliers. In the analysis, both spline based methods provide the lowest reconstruction errors for reconstructions from incomplete gradient fields. Furthermore, the pre-processing of gradient fields is investigated. Median filter pre-processing offers a computationally efficient method that is robust to outliers. After the reconstruction error analysis, selected reconstruction methods are applied to imaging slope gauge data measured in the wind-wave facility Aeolotron in Heidelberg. Using newly developed segmentation methods, it is possible to detect different coordinate system orientations of gradient field data and reconstruction algorithms. In addition, the use of a zero slope correction for reconstructions from the provided imaging slope gauge data is justified. The impact of light refracting bubbles on reconstructions from this data is part of this thesis as well.

Direct observations and sediment sampling from the Pisces IV submersible {{have been used to}} ground-trmh surface-based survey dam and to quantify relationships between the bedforms and the processes responsible for their formation. The ripples are formed in polymodal sandy gravels with modal sizes ranging from 0. 1 to 45 ram. Evaluation of threshold criteria for coarse sediments ogether with an I 1 -year record from a nearby wave-rider buoy suggests that existing models for wave enWainment of gravel on rippled surfaces overestimate the critical velocity by a factor of approximately 2 and that conditions suitable for transport of the coarsest (45 -ram) size mode sampled in the ripple crests occur, on average, 43 hr/yr. Analysis of gravel ripples on the inner Scotian Shelf and of other examples noted in the recent literature extends the range of empirical data for oscillation ripple wavelengths by a factor of 3 and for ripple grain size by a factor of 5.

At the Aeolotron bubble detection up to the water surface is feasible. It {{has been shown that}} the density of bubbles correlates to wind speed, water conditions, the distance to the water surface {{as well as to the}} tank geometry. Observations show an increased bubble density in salt water compared to fresh water at the same wind conditions.

Low Butanol concentrations in the water lead to an increased density of bubbles and additionally, as could be shown in the Aeolotron, a significant increase of very small bubbles (r< 65 µm). Adding Butanol seems to be a good, non-corrosive substitute for seawater. The influence of the <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> was systematically researched by carrying out measurement series in the annular wind wave facility in Heidelberg as well as measurement series in linear wind wave facilities in Marseille, France and Kyoto Japan, both of which have different sizes and fetch lengths.

40|$|Falsterbo Peninsula in the {{south-west}} {{corner of}} Sweden is low-lying and built up of unconsolidated sand. Vulnerability to high water levels and wave action {{is of concern}} for the 10, 000 residents of the peninsula, especially in consideration of global warming as enhanced inundation and coastal erosion problems may ensue. Rational counteractions of such problems are possible only through sufficient knowledge of local coastal processes. Equally important are planning and ability to identify threatened areas. This thesis addresses these issues from the present time until 2050. It is, in a sense, pioneering as it draws together results from several fields: coastal morphology/dynamics, wave modeling, geostatistics, geohydrology, and coastal protection strategies. It is found that the annual-high water level around the peninsula increases by 5 mm per year and statistically will exceed + 1. 5 m in relation to present mean sea level every 2 years by 2050. According to a digital elevation model (DEM) developed for the study, such exceedence will result in inundation for some 20 % of the westerly urban areas. Extreme water levels are not directly related to local strong winds, but arise from regional hydrographic and meteorological effects. Hence, extreme waves and water levels are unlikely to occur concurrently. The exceptional sensitivity of the local coastal environment is confirmed by that human activity has contributed to the rapid growth of the three most distinct features along the peninsula coast. Sediment supplies are primarily from the east, and potentially the south-west and the incident waves are typically erosive in nature. Of the anticipated mean sea-level rise of 0. 20 m and potential shift in precipitation/evapotranspiration rates until 2050, the former is believed to have greater impact on the unconfined groundwater-table position. An important finding is that a limited sand-layer thickness largely governs the groundwater-flooding liability of a given region. Vegetated earth dams and beach nourishment are the most viable solutions for potential flooding and erosion problems. They can be integrated into the unique landscape and precious coastal areas with minor aesthetic impacts. In addition, the moderate wave climate means that long time intervals can elapse between renourishments. Furthermore, the wave climates off the south and east coasts of the Baltic Sea are analyzed with the numerical model WAVAD under the BASYS-project (EC-MAST III). Quantitative wave-climate knowledge is paramount to the prime objective of BASYS; to estimate the fluxes of nutrients and matter from coastal areas to deeper basins of the Baltic Sea. Wave climates over 19 years are derived at four locations along the south and east coasts of the Baltic Sea. The mean significant wave height is found to increase northward, primarily due to increased <b>fetch</b> <b>lengths.</b> In addition, theoretical distributions are used to determine what wave heights can be expected to occur at 1, 10, and 50 -year intervals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{lacustrine}} geomorphology of Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau. The shorelines {{of the two}} lakes are described and mapped. The type of shoreline produced {{is a product of}} the local geology and the effects of subaerial and lacustrine processes. Approximately three quarters of the shorelines are hard rock walls the remainder being deltaic and morainic pavements and beaches, arm head beaches and pocket sand beaches. Low lake levels have resulted in beach slumping and degradation, on the pocket sand beaches where surficial sediments are thin and beach basement materials fundamentally different from the surficial deposits. The beach and nearshore relief may be likened to an ideal wave worked continental shelf in terms of both profile geometry and shore normal sediment distribution. The wind and wave climates are described and wave forecast curves prepared; the low energy and narrow range of wave forms restricts the range of morphologies produced. Both lakes have a wide natural range of lake levels ensuring that lake levels control the elevation at which an extremely limited energy resource is dissipated on the beach face. The distinctive shelf profile has been formed during low levels when wave action is highly effective in disturbing material on the outer shelf. Since the lakes have come under control the natural range of levels has been reduced and lake levels lowered, wave effectiveness on the outer shelf has been increased accordingly. The wakes produced by passing launches modify the natural wave climate particularly at beaches exposed to short <b>fetch</b> <b>lengths.</b> The magnitude, frequency and direction of wave approach are all adversely affected. The discussion of beach morphology shows the profile form of the beaches to be in equilibrium with energy and level conditions; only minor shore normal transfers of sediment are required to maintain this balance. On beaches exposed to a wide range of wave approach directions and particularly those confined by well defined barriers changes in both the profile form and plan shape of the beach are necessitated to maintain equilibrium. Sustained periods of zero wave energy prevail, resulting in the stranding and drowning of beach forms during periods of fluctuating levels. Changes in beach morphology in response to fluctuating lake levels follow the Bruun effect, whereby there is a net shoreward movement of material on falling levels and net lakeward movement on rising levels. The erosion and deposition on the nearshore shelf takes the form of a wedge of material widest closest inshore, rather than that of a uniform change in elevation as suggested by Bruun. As such this provides one of the first field verifications of the Bruun effect beyond the breaker zone. Tracer experiments confirm that long periods of inactivity occur and that on both fine and coarse grained beaches the largest sediment transfers take place under and landward of the breaker. Sediment dispersal lakeward of the breaker on the outer shelf is slow and is not usually manifested in measurable morphological changes. Tracer experiments point to the nearshore shelf being a wave worked deposit formed during storm conditions at low lake levels exceeded greater than 87 % of the time in the natural record. Recommendations for operational control of the two lakes confirm that the guidelines drawn up by the Guardians of Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau could not be improved on and if adhered to should maintain the stability of the lakeshore beaches...|$|R

Key to successful measurements is the precise control of a locally applied heat flux density at the water surface. A new way of beam shaping with diffractive optical elements is introduced that significantly increases the spatial homogeneity of the heat flux density. A new multifrequency excitation scheme is developed and successfully implemented that reduces measurement times by a factor of 4 to 12 depending on wind speed. Systematic studies about the dependence of heat transfer on surfactant concentration and <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> are carried out in the annular wind-wave facility Aeolotron in Heidelberg. The presence of the artificial surfactant Triton X- 100 reduces heat transfer for an intermediate wind speed range, but not for extremely low or for high wind speeds.

Experiments in the Aeolotron with actual sea water from the North Sea containing natural surfactants show similar results as the measurements with the artificial surfactant Triton X- 100. A measurement series in the linear wind-wave facility Pytheas in Marseille, France, shows that wave breaking enhances heat transfer in an intermediate wind speed regime. Simultaneous measurements of heat and gas transfer velocities are in agreement with each other for the sea water conditions investigated in the Aeolotron, when scaled to the transfer velocity of a gas with the same Schmidt number. However, heat transfer velocities are measured to be twice as large as gas transfer velocities in another experimental series with unknown biological activity in the Aeolotron...|$|E

Depth of the mid-layer intrusion, which depends on inflowing salinity and the lagoon stratification state, affects the corresponding lagoon’s water quality. This paper discusses reproduction of the mid-layer intrusion considering the effect of wind, which is responsible for enhancing near surface turbulence kinetic energy through the breaking wave. Having nearly closed shape, with only one small entrance for the water exchange, the lagoon is expected to behave similar to a small lake when it experiences wind forcing over its surface. Wind forcing is responsible for developing wave fields. Due to limited horizontal extend of the lagoon area, the <b>fetches</b> have insufficient <b>length</b> to allow the waves to be fully developed.

40|$|Wave {{exposure}} plays a {{major role}} in shaping the ecological structure of nearshore communities, with different community types able to survive and/or thrive when typically exposed to different levels of wave energy. This can be quantified by taking direct field measurements with wave buoys over time and then manipulating the data to derive typical conditions. However, taking these measurements is only feasible for very limited areas due to logistical constraints, and generating them with numerical wave models can also be expensive to run and may require data inputs that are either lacking or are highly uncertain. Instead, the relative differences in wave exposure between places (relative wave exposure) may be sufficient to distinguish between different community types. It is possible to approximate relative wave exposure using a cartographic approach. Typically this involves measuring the relative shelter or openness of a particular location based on the distances from it to the nearest potential wave blocking obstacle in all directions with provides an approximation of fetch. Given that dominant wind speed and direction data is available for a particular site, these fetch distances can be manipulated to estimate the potential wave climate at that site, with some models going as far as to link this to linear wave theory in order to calculate wave power. This works because the extent to which large waves can form, and to which seas are ‘fully developed’, is constrained by wind velocity, time and fetch. Mapping relative wave exposure in this relatively simple way could be used to predict the spatial distribution of broad categories of ecological community types, especially where this information is difficult to collect using more direct methods. Despite its relative efficiency and simplicity, running a cartographic-based relative exposure model for more than a local study area quickly becomes computationally intensive, which drives the need to set up the model to run as quickly as possible while minimizing the risk of not detecting potential wave blocking obstacles, and thus underestimating the wave exposure. Yet surprisingly, no studies have tested the sensitivity of the relative wave exposure estimates that these models produce to variation in how key factors, such as the density of points from which fetch distances are measured (point spacing), the angle increment at which the fetch lines are drawn around each point (fetch angle spacing), and the adjustment of <b>fetch</b> line <b>lengths</b> based on bathymetry, are set in the model. This paper presents a preliminary analysis that shows the extent to which estimated relative wave exposure changed when the above model settings were varied for four case study areas within the Great Barrier Reef selected for their characteristic spatial arrangement (number and density) of obstacles. This was done using a new GIS-based generic model for estimating relative wave exposure (GREMO) which integrates many existing techniques into a single modeling platfor...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine {{morphology}} {{is constantly}} changing because of continual sediment transport mainly driven by tidal asymmetry and wind waves. For modelling purposes, intertidal areas {{have often been}} simplified to relatively semi-circular basins. Although suitable for providing a preliminary understanding of processes, this approach {{does not take into}} account the real curvature of natural basins. One way of studying the morphology of an estuary is to use its hypsometry. This quantity, often represented as a curve, describes the area-weighted distribution of depth and therefore includes the uneven form of a basin. Overseas studies have shown that the shape of the hypsometric curve of an estuary can be used as a measure of its state of infilling. 	The present study focuses on the morphology of New Zealand estuaries by comparing their hypsometric curves and examining the relative contribution of various forcing factors towards the shape of these curves and consequently towards the development of the morphology. I applied the hypsometric relationship defined by Boon & Byrne (1981) in order to assess how well it describes New Zealand estuaries and what factors influence the shape of the hypsometric curve. Their equation introduces the empirical parameter which controls the concavity of the curve. Area-depth curves were computed using bathymetric data for the 22 studied estuaries. The best fitting curves relative to Boon & Byrne’s relationship were determined by minimising the error between the modelled and observed curves and provided a measure of for each site. This relationship appeared to be relatively satisfactory (error of less than 5 %) for most estuaries. A database was created where the tidal range, the length of the longest <b>fetch,</b> the <b>length</b> of the <b>fetch</b> along the direction of most common winds, the wind speed and the significant wave height were stored for each study estuary. The impact of each parameter was estimated using statistical clustering analysis. No clear correlation could be identified. Conversely the results suggest that estuaries with the same environmental conditions could present very different values of γ. Current data, sedimentation accumulation rates and proportion of intertidal area at high water were also collected which enabled to observe that for some study sites the value of seems to be a reasonable indicator of the degree of infilling. However there were exceptions and some sites with higher γ were in an advanced state of infilling. This suggests that even though Boon & Byrne’s relationship provides a reasonable representation of the hypsometry of New Zealand estuaries, the parameter does not seem to be a satisfactory measure of infilling of New Zealand estuaries. The present study also showed that when comparing with studies conducted in the United Kingdom and in the United Stated it appeared that the values of estimated for New Zealand estuaries are in the whole higher than overseas. This could be attributed to the fact that New Zealand basins are relatively young systems but also could be due to other specificities of those basins such as the influence of the geology...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{tropical}} cyclones in the South China Sea is over a vast deep sea, {{southeast of the}} Philippines. The severetropical cyclones in summer with northerly tracks attack the Philippines, China, Korea and Japan, while the moderate ones inthe rainy season with northwesterly tracks pass Vietnam, Laos and northern Thailand. In October, November and December, the tropical cyclones are weakened and tracks shift to a lower latitude passing the Gulf of Thailand. Tropical cyclone disasters in the Gulf of Thailand due to strong winds causing storm surges and big waves or heavy rainfall over high mountains in causing floods and land slides result in moderate damages and casualties. Analyses are made of six decades of data of tropical cyclones from 1951 - 2006 having averaged numbers of 3 and 13 in Thailand and the South China Sea respectively. Detailed calculation of surges and wave heights of the 5 disastrous tropical cyclones in the Gulf of Thailand reveal that the Upper Gulf of Thailand with a limited <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> of about 100 km in north/south direction and about 100 km width in the east/west direction, resulted in a limited maximum wave height of 2. 3 - 2. 5 m and maximum storm surge height of 1. 2 m generated by Typhoon Vae (1952), while the east coast, with longer fetch lengthbut still limited by the existence of its shoreline, resulted in an increased maximum wave height of 4 m and maximum storm surge height of 0. 6 m in the Upper Gulf of Thailand generated by Typhoon Linda (1997). These are the Probable Maximum Cyclones here. The southern shoreline, with unlimited <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> on the east by tropical cyclones approaching from the South China Sea, generated maximum wave height of 6 - 11 m by Typhoon Gay (1989), resulting in more casualties and damages. Note that storm surges on the southern shorelines with steep slopes are small due to the short distance of shallow shorelines in receiving wind stresses for piling up sea levels. These disasters can be alleviated from known characteristics of tropical cyclones and through proper warning {{before coming to the}} Gulf of Thailand...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} {{training}} modules on marine wind and waves. The first module discussed wave types and characteristics and is a good primer to this next marine training topic. Wave Life Cycle I: Generation examines how wind creates waves and the inter-relationships between wind speed, wind duration, and <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> during this process. These three factors are important to predicting wave height and what will limit wave growth. Additional topics include fully developed seas, observation sources, and various special wind events such as coastal jets and instability mixing in the marine boundary layer. While much of this instruction is at a basic level, all marine forecasters will find benefit in the more intermediate and advanced topics. These include the issue of dynamic or trapped fetch as well as the use of satellite-based observations of marine winds using the active microwave technique known as scatterometry. User interactions are included throughout the module and within the short case study. The next module in the series will look at propagation and dispersion as the waves leave the generation area.

40|$|Tides {{are often}} {{considered}} to be the dominant hydrodynamic process within mesotidal estuaries although waves can also have a large influence on intertidal erosion rates. Here, we use a combination of hydrodynamic measurements and sediment deposition records to determine the conditions under which observed waves are “morphologically significant”, in which case they influence tidal and suspended sediment flux asymmetry and subsequently infilling over geomorphological timescales. Morphological significant conditions were evaluated using data from contrasting arms in a dendritic mesotidal estuary, in which the orientation of the arms relative to the prevailing wind results in a marked difference in wave conditions, deposition rates and morphology. By defining the morphological significance of waves as a product of the magnitude of bed shear stress and frequency of occurrence, even small (but frequently occurring) winds are shown to be capable of generating waves that are morphologically significant given sufficient fetch. In the arm in which <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> is restricted, only stronger but rare storm events can influence sediment flux and therefore tides are more morphologically significant over longer timescales. Water depth within this mesotidal estuary is shown to be a critical parameter in controlling morphological significance; the rapid attenuation of short period waves with depth results in contrasting patterns of erosion occurring during neaps and accretion during springs...|$|E
40|$|The Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) modules {{used for}} {{embedded}} microprocessor devices consume {{a large portion}} of the whole system’s power. The memory module consumes static power on keeping awake and dynamic power on memory accesses. The power dissipation of the instruction memory can be limited by using code compression methods, which reduce the memory size. The compression may require the use of variable length instruction formats in the processor. The power-efficient design of variable <b>length</b> instruction <b>fetch</b> and decode units is challenging for static multiple-issue processors, because such architectures have simple hardware to begin with, as they aim for very low power consumption on embedded platforms. The power saved by using these compression approaches, which necessitate more complex logic, is easily lost on inefficient processor design. This thesis proposes an implementation for instruction template-based compression, its decompression and two instruction fetch design alternatives for variable length instruction encoding on Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA), a static multiple-issue exposed data path architecture. Both of the new fetch and decode units are integrated into the TTA-based Co-design Environment (TCE), which is a toolset for rapid designing and prototyping of processors based on TTA. The hardware description of the fetch units is verified on a register transfer level and benchmarked using the CHStone test suite. Furthermore, the fetch units are synthesized on a 40 nm standard cell Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology library for area, performance and power consumption measurements. The power cost of the variable length instruction support is compared to the power savings from memory reduction, which is evaluated using HP Labs’ CACTI tool. The compression approach reaches an average program size reduction of 44 % at best with a set of test programs, and the total power consumption of the system is reduced. The thesis shows that the proposed variable <b>length</b> <b>fetch</b> designs are sufficiently low-power oriented for TTA processors to benefit from the code compression...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the wind}} jet dynamics {{in the northern}} margin of the Ebro River shelf (NW Mediterranean Sea) are investigated using coupled numerical models. The study area is characterised by persistent and energetic offshore winds during autumn and winter. During these seasons, a seaward wind jet usually develops in a 50 km wide band offshore. The COAWST (Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere–Wave–Sediment Transport) modelling system was implemented in the region {{with a set of}} downscaling meshes to obtain high-resolution meteooceanographic outputs. Wind, waves and water currents were compared with in situ observations and remote-sensingderived products with an acceptable level of agreement. Focused on an intense offshore wind event, the modelled wind jet appears in a limited area offshore with strong spatial variability. The wave pattern during the wind jet is characterised by the development of bimodal directional spectra, and the ocean circulation tends to present well-defined twolayer flow in the shallower region (i. e. inner shelf). The outer shelf tends to be dominated by mesoscale dynamics such as the slope current. Due to the limited <b>fetch</b> <b>length,</b> ocean surface roughness considering sea state (wave–atmosphere coupling) modifies to a small extent the wind and significant wave height under severe cross-shelf wind events. However, the coupling effect in the wind resource assessment may be relevant due to the cubic relation between the wind intensity and power. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A {{grounded}} rubble field can be advantageous when it surrounds an Arctic offshore structure. It can attenuate ice {{loads and}} {{could be used as}} a base for an evacuation shelter. These advantages mean that the creation of a sTable., grounded rubble field at an offshore site can be beneficial for locations in the transition and landfast ice zones of the Beaufort Sea. In the winter of 1989 1990, the Molikpaq Caisson was deployed at the Isserk I- 15 site in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. During October and early November, the Molikpaq was exposed to mobile first year ice driven by strong winds. This series of storms built a 2 ̆ 01 ccigar-shaped 2 ̆ 01 d rubble field at the site. Detailed information concerning the rubble field development at this site was collected. In this paper, a numerical model is used to examine the factors that affect the generation of a grounded rubble field. The observations from Isserk are used to validate the model. By investigating several scenarios of ice interaction, through an examination of the influence of water depth, ice thickness, velocity and <b>fetch</b> <b>length</b> upon rubble extent, the model can be used to provide information on the rate of growth of grounded rubble fields. The data can be used to quantify the effects of ice rubble on reducing ice loads in the winter and provide guidance on rubble stability and optimal rubble field extent, as well as evacuation options.
