Parental maltreatment and other disadvantages mean that their life outcomes are often poor compared to children generally. Anglicare Victoria’s Children <b>in</b> <b>Care</b> Report Card shows the ‘gap’ between children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and all children. Information on 142 children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> was collected from case records and compared to population data. The results for physical activity, obesity and healthy lifestyle were positive. However, a much higher proportion of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> had emotional and behavioural problems and chronic health conditions compared to children who were not <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Education participation rates of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were similar to children in the community. However, children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were less engaged in education and less likely to be reaching their learning potential. Older teenagers <b>in</b> <b>care</b> also had limited independent living skills and lacked access to important identity documents. Too many children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> were disconnected from birth fathers and peers. Children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> also had fewer opportunities than children who were not <b>in</b> <b>care</b> to participate <b>in</b> activities that would help them build community networks. It is everyone’s responsibility to help bridge the gap between the life outcomes of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and those same outcomes among children who are not <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Results from the Children <b>in</b> <b>Care</b> Report Card show us where we need to act...|$|R

40|$|Background: Retention <b>in</b> HIV <b>care</b> {{improves}} {{survival and}} {{reduces the risk of}} HIV transmission to others. Multiple quantitative studies have described demographic and clinical characteristics associated with retention <b>in</b> HIV <b>care.</b> However, qualitative studies are needed to better understand barriers and facilitators. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 51 HIV-infected individuals, 25 who were retained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and 26 not retained <b>in</b> <b>care,</b> from 3 urban clinics. Interview data were analyzed for themes using a modified grounded theory approach. Identified themes were compared between the two groups of interest: patients retained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and those not retained <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Overall, participants identified 12 barriers and 5 facilitators to retention <b>in</b> HIV <b>care.</b> On average, retained individuals provided 3 barriers, while persons not retained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> provided 5 barriers. Both groups commonly discussed depression/mental illness, feeling sick, and competing life activities as barriers. In addition, individuals not retained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> commonly reported expensive and unreliable transportation, stigma, and insufficient insurance as barriers. On average, participants in both groups referenced 2 facilitators, including the presence of social support, patient-friendly clinic services (transportation, co-location of services, scheduling/reminders), and positive relationships with providers and clinic staff. Conclusions: In our study, patients not retained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> faced more barriers, particularly social and structural barriers, than those retained <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Developing care models where social and financial barriers are addressed, mental health and substance abuse treatment is integrated, and patient-friendly services are offered is important to keeping HIV-infected individuals engaged <b>in</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop simplified tools for measuring retention <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> METHODS: Retrospective cohort data were collected from patient registers in nine health facilities in Ethiopia. Retention <b>in</b> <b>care</b> was the primary outcome for the study. Tools were developed to measure "current retention" <b>in</b> <b>care</b> during a specific period of time for a specific "ART-age group" and "cohort retention" <b>in</b> <b>care</b> among patients who were followed for the last "Y" number of years on ART. "Probability of retention" based on the tool for "cohort retention" <b>in</b> <b>care</b> was compared with "probability of retention" based on Kaplan Meier. RESULTS: We found that the new tools enable to measure "current retention" and "cohort retention" <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> We also found that the tools were easy to use and did not require advanced statistical skills. Both "current retention" and "cohort retention" are lower among patients in the first two "ART-age groups" and "ART-age cohorts" than in subsequent "ART-age groups" and "ART-age cohorts". The "probability of retention" based on the new tools were found to be similar to the "probability of retention" based on Kaplan Meier. CONCLUSION: The simplified tools for "current retention" and "cohort retention" will enable practitioners and program managers to measure and monitor rates of retention <b>in</b> <b>care</b> easily and appropriately. We therefore recommend that health facilities and programs start to use these tools in their efforts to improve retention <b>in</b> <b>care</b> and patient outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} based on a PhD study, {{undertaken}} between 2005 and 2010, focusing on improving educational engagement and outcomes for children and young people <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> The views expressed in this report are those of the author and not those of the Department of Family and Community Services. The purpose of this report is to inform the NSW education and out-of-home care sectors about the findings and the implications for better policy and practice in this area. The poor educational performance of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> has been a concern, internationally, for a number of decades. In Australia, it has received less attention even though the limited research to date indicates that children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> are performing more poorly than their non-care peers and face a range of barriers in engaging with their school life. This study sought to develop an understanding of the issues impacting on the educational engagement and outcomes for children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> NSW. The research and data collection were guided by five main questions: What are the educational outcomes for children currently <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> What are the factors that affect the educational engagement of children <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> How do the various transitions children may experience <b>in</b> <b>care</b> affect their education and how can these transitions best be supported? What are the experiences of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> their transition to high school and how can this transition best be supported? How can the immediate environments of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> facilitate positive educational engagement and outcomes? This report presents the findings from two main sets of data: case studies of a sample of children <b>in</b> <b>care</b> before and after they made the transition from primary to high school and large-scale data on children 2 ̆ 7 s educational participation and performance. The large-scale data highlight how children and young people <b>in</b> <b>care</b> are performing on educational assessments (n = 2317) compared with students in the general population.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{evolution}} of CD 4 count of HIV-infected patients in follow-up {{as an indicator of}} quality of care. Methods: Adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV in 2007 who entered <b>in</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> the AIDS Reference Centres (ARC) and remained <b>in</b> <b>care</b> for at least one year were studied until end 2009. Optimal CD 4 evolution was defined as having a CD 4 count above 350 cells/mm 3 after 1 year <b>in</b> HIV <b>care,</b> or an increasing rate exceeding 50 cells/mm 3 per year, and this regardless of antiviral therapy. The proportion of patients with optimal CD 4 evolution was measured and factors associated with outcome were identified by logistic regression. Results: 482 patients were included. Median age was 37 years, 31. 1 % were females, 51. 7 % Belgians, 32. 2 % from Sub-Saharan Africa, 50. 5 % heterosexual, 48. 7 % MSM. 59. 5 % had a CD 4 count above 350 at entry <b>in</b> <b>care,</b> 11. 2 % did not have a regular retention <b>in</b> <b>care</b> (at least 1 consultation/ 6 -month period). 401 (83. 2 %) patients had an optimal CD 4 evolution after 1 year <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> 60. 5 % of patients with non-optimal evolution had a CD 4 count below 350 at entry <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Although the proportion of female sex, heterosexual transmission, Sub-Saharan nationality and low retention <b>in</b> <b>care</b> was higher <b>in</b> the non-optimal CD 4 evolution group compared to the optimal group, none of these characteristics showed a significant association with non-optimal CD 4 count evolution.

40|$|Research {{from the}} English-speaking world {{consistently}} shows that children 1 leaving {{the care of}} the State 2 tend to have lower levels of educational attainment and higher rates of unemployment and social disadvantage than other young people. Recent research has argued that difficulties in schooling and education experienced by children living <b>in</b> <b>care</b> lie ‘far more <b>in</b> the <b>care</b> and education systems than in the children themselves’ (Jackson and McParlin, 2006 : 91).

Does a care background influence the educational experiences of children <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> 2. What are the main factors in the social and academic spheres that impact on the educational experiences of children <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> 3.
