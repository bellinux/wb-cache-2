5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E

5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It {{is a combination of}} a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect.

Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where {{the patient was}} being kept and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes to create the feeling of movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons of gasoline and 120 black-powder bombs were used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect.</b> The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent.

Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.|$|E

5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> they were trying to capture.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{attending}} and reinforcement in conditional discriminations (Nevin, Davison, & Shahan, 2005) is extended to working memory in delayed matching to sample by adding terms for disruption of attending during the retention interval. Like its predecessor, the theory assumes that reinforcers and disruptors affect the independent probabilities of attending to sample and comparison stimuli {{in the same}} way as the rate of overt free-operant responding as suggested by Nevin and Grace (2000), and that attending is translated into discriminative performance by the model of Davison and Nevin (1999). <b>The</b> theory accounts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of sample-stimulus discriminability and retention-interval disruption on the levels and slopes of forgetting functions, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diverse relations between accuracy and sensitivity to reinforcement reported in the literature. It also accounts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of reinforcer probability in multiple schedules on the levels and resistance to change of forgetting functions; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of reinforcer probabilities signaled within delayed-matching trials; and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of reinforcer delay, sample duration, and intertrial-interval duration. <b>The</b> model accounts <b>for</b> some data that have been problematic for previous theories, and makes testably different predictions of <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of reinforcer probabilities and disruptors on forgetting functions in multiple schedules and signaled trials...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{simulation}} {{studies have}} pointed to the higher power of <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mediated <b>effect</b> versus <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> total <b>effect,</b> even in <b>the</b> presence of a direct effect. This has motivated applied researchers to investigate mediation in settings {{where there is no}} evidence of a total effect. In this paper we provide analytical insight into the circumstances under which higher power of <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mediated <b>effect</b> versus <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> total <b>effect</b> can be expected in the absence of a direct effect. We argue that the acclaimed power gain is somewhat deceptive and comes with a big price. On the basis of the results, we recommend that when the primary interest lies in mediation only, a significant test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> total <b>effect</b> should not be used as a prerequisite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indirect <b>effect.</b> However, because <b>the</b> test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indirect <b>effect</b> is vulnerable to bias when common causes of mediator and outcome are not measured or not accounted for, it should be evaluated in a sensitivity analysis...|$|R
