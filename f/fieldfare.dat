5|$|The {{song thrush}} {{is not usually}} gregarious, {{although}} several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats, perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird, <b>fieldfare,</b> redwing and dark-throated thrush. Unlike the more nomadic <b>fieldfare</b> and redwing, the song thrush tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas.|$|E
5|$|The English {{common name}} <b>fieldfare</b> {{dates back to}} at least the {{eleventh}} century. The Anglo-Saxon word feldefare perhaps meant traveller through the fields.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> (Turdus pilaris) is {{a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in {{woodland}} and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and seeds in the winter.|$|E

50|$|The hedgerows of {{the field}} system provide an ideal habitat for dormice and also offer food for {{overwintering}} <b>fieldfares</b> and redwings.|$|R
5|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> is omnivorous. Animal food in {{the diet}} {{includes}} snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked {{in the field and}} grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} the <b>fieldfare</b> frequents mixed {{woodland}} of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> is a {{migratory species}} with a palearctic distribution. It breeds in {{northern}} Norway, northern Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Siberia as far east as Transbaikal, the Aldan River and the Tian Shan Mountains in North West China. Its winter range extends through West and South Europe to North Africa, {{though it is}} uncommon in the Mediterranean region. Eastern populations migrate to Anatolia, Israel, Iran and Northwest India, and occasionally Northeast India. It is a vagrant to Iceland, Greenland, Spitsbergen, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Madeira, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta and Cyprus.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a linear}} site along Coldhams Brook, which is managed to {{encourage}} water voles. There are birds such as kingfishers, redwings and <b>fieldfares,</b> and butterflies include speckled woods and orange tips.|$|R
5|$|The {{flight of}} the <b>fieldfare</b> is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before {{flapping}} on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
25|$|Lough Leane, and {{the other}} lakes to a lesser extent, support {{wintering}} birds that travel south from higher latitudes. These species include redwing, <b>fieldfare,</b> golden plover and waterfowl such as teal, goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and whooper swan. The park's native bird populations are augmented by migrant species in both winter and summer. A small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) from the world population of approximately 12,000 migrates to winter on boglands in the Killarney Valley within the park. The numbers of this bird that stay in the park are currently low, at less than twenty individuals. This population {{is important because it}} is the most southerly in Ireland {{and one of the few}} remaining populations remaining that feed entirely on bogland, and whose habitat almost entirely lies within a protected area.|$|E
25|$|At the Newmarket-Craven meeting, Eleanor {{received}} 200 guineas from Mr. Sitwell {{after his}} horse <b>Fieldfare</b> forfeited a three-mile match race. At the same meeting Eleanor ran third to Sir Hedworth Williamson's horse Walton in the Oatlands Stakes. At the First Spring meeting in Newmarket, she {{was second in}} the King's Plate to Lord Sackville's horse Dick Andrews (later the sire of Eleanor's 1814 filly foal). At Ipswich, Eleanor won £50 in a two-mile race. At Oxford, Eleanor beat her sister Julia to win The Cup and won £50 in three-mile heat races. At Huntingdon she won two £50 races, beating the colt Pipylin in one race. She beat the filly Primrose for the Lincoln King's Plate. She was beaten by Penelope at the Second October meeting at Newmarket in 375-guinea sweepstake race. She ran twice more in 1803 but did not place in either start.|$|E

500|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> {{is easily}} {{recognisable}} with its slate-grey head, nape and rump, dark brown back, blackish tail and boldly speckled breast. In flight, its white under wing-coverts and axillaries are conspicuous. The harsh flight call [...] "tsak tsak" [...] is also distinctive.|$|E
500|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> is [...] long, with a grey crown, {{neck and}} rump, a plain brown back, dark wings and tail and white underwings. The breast and flanks are heavily spotted. The breast has a reddish wash {{and the rest}} of the underparts are white. The sexes are similar in {{appearance}} but the females are slightly more brown. The male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls.|$|E
500|$|The <b>fieldfare</b> has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated forty two to seventy two million individuals in Europe. There {{are thought to be}} up to twenty thousand individuals in Russia and the global population is estimated to be between forty four and ninety six million individuals. The population size appears to be stable and the bird is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as being of [...] "Least Concern".|$|E

5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. <b>Fieldfares</b> are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, <b>fieldfares</b> mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|R

500|$|... "An austringer [...] {{undertaking}} {{to train}} a sparrowhawk {{should be in}} doubt that he is taking {{on one of the}} most difficult hawks available." [...] A female Eurasian sparrowhawk is considered a bad choice for a novice and the male is very difficult and demanding, even for an experienced handler. They have been described as [...] "hysterical little hawks" [...] but are also praised as courageous and providing [...] "sport of the highest quality." [...] Philip Glasier describes Eurasian sparrowhawks as [...] "in many ways superior to hunting with a larger short-wing [...] " [...] and [...] "extremely hard to tame." [...] They are best suited for small quarry such as common starlings and common blackbirds but are also capable of taking common teal, Eurasian magpies, pheasants and partridges. A 19th century author remarked that this species was [...] "the best of all hawks for landrails", now known as corn crakes. In 1735, the Sportsman's Dictionary noted that [...] "... she will serve in the winter as well as in the summer, and will fly at all kind of game more than the falcon.

500|$|The {{breeding}} season starts in May in Poland but further north in Scandinavia may not start until early July. The female <b>fieldfare</b> builds a cup-shaped nest with no attempt at concealment. The location is often in woodland {{but may be}} in a hedgerow, garden, among rocks, in a pile of logs, in a hut or on the ground. Fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species. The adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators. The nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss, with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses. There are usually five to six eggs in a clutch, but occasionally three, four, seven or eight eggs are laid. The eggs vary in size from [...] to [...] and are variable in colour. Many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird. Others are bright blue, with or without larger red-brown splotches. Incubation starts before all the eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days. The female does all or most of the incubation. The chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them. They are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season, especially in the southern parts of the breeding range.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, the village enjoyed {{a variety of}} fortunes. The {{distillery}} closed in 1926 (see below) {{and one of the}} most important historical locations in Easter Ross, Balconie Castle, was demolished in 1965. It had been an old seat of the Earls of Ross, but by the 1960s the owner could not afford to repair the dry rot. There was a RAF airfield constructed near Evanton in 1922, on Alness Bay. It was first known as the [...] "Novar Base", because of its location on the Novar Estates, then later as HMS <b>Fieldfare.</b> It was serviced from Leuchars, and was used by the aircraft from the nearby Home Fleet base of Invergordon. The largest aircraft to have landed there was a USAAF B17. On Empire Day, 1939, RAF bases all over the United Kingdom were opened to the public, and the Evanton Aerodrome was the most northerly location to participate, attracting 9000 visitors. In 1956, the airfield served as one of the launch bases of the GENETRIX program , to send stratospheric balloons carrying high resolution cameras over the Soviet Union. Of the 516 balloons launched from the five bases, 103 were launched from Evanton, of which 60 were successful, and 43 failed soon after launch, or gone stray [...] The base closed in the 1970s. However, the oil boom of the 1970s caused radical expansion of the village. It has been growing steadily ever since.|$|E
50|$|The bird-life of {{the formal}} areas is typical of parkland in {{southern}} England. Nuthatches like the old timber; spotted flycatchers the more open ground; and redwings and <b>fieldfares</b> the more open ground yet. Common and black-headed, and sometimes lesser black-backed and herring, gulls form loose flocks on the lower reaches towards the Gade.|$|R

I have remembered when the winter came, High in my chamber in the frosty nights, When in the still light of the cheerful moon, On every twig and rail and jutting spout, The icy spears were adding to their length Against the arrows of the coming sun, How in the shimmering noon of summer past Some unrecorded beam slanted across The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew; Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, Which now through all its course stands still and dumb Its own memorial,--purling at its play Along the slopes, and through the meadows next, Until its youthful sound was hushed at last In the staid current of the lowland stream; Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned, And where the <b>fieldfare</b> followed in the rear, When all the fields around lay bound and hoar Beneath a thick integument of snow. So by God's cheap economy made rich To go upon my winter's task again.|$|E
