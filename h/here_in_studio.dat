Pygmalion, looking above the proliferation of ankles, thighs and buttocks reflected on the floor and pedestal in front of him, is pondering his next creation. His gaze ignores the women around him as he sees in his mind a statue of the perfect female.|$|R
5000|$|Rising {{from the}} unfortunate start the band {{spent most of}} 1997 touring Scandinavia and started {{recording}} their second album Still <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> Airplay <b>Studios,</b> Stockholm with Uffe [...] "Chris Laney" [...] Larsson and Pontus Norgren as producers and with guest appearance by Thomas Vikström and Lena Vikström on backing vocals. The album was later mixed by Anders [...] "Theo" [...] Theander at Roastinghouse Records, Malmö, and was finally released in 1999 by the Danish label Kick Music (later Sony Music). The band signed a publishing deal with Scandinavian songs for this album. With this album the band showcased their ability to mix acoustic guitars with heavy guitar riffs in strong hooky melodies. With this album the band certainly proved {{that they were a}} force to be reckoned with. Still Here was well received by their fans and received great reviews from the press, e.g. 8,5 out of 10 in HardRoxx online. The song [...] "Crying Out" [...] featured on the compilation A Fist Full of Rock 'n Roll volume 13.|$|R
5000|$|I {{recorded}} the album <b>here</b> <b>in</b> my <b>studio</b> {{on the lower}} east side (although 'studio' always seems like an overly grand word for a bunch of equipment set up in a small bedroom). In the past I've worked in large and small studios, but for this record I wanted to record everything at home by myself", Moby said on his journal. [...] "I started working on the album about a year ago, and the creative impetus behind the record was hearing a David Lynch speech at BAFTA, in the UK. David was talking about creativity, and to paraphrase, about how creativity in and of itself, and without market pressures, is fine and good. It seems as if too often an artist's, musician's or writer's creative output is judged by how well it accommodates the marketplace, and how much market share it commands and how much money it generates. In making this record I wanted to focus on making something that I loved, without really being concerned about how it might be received by the marketplace. As a result it's a quieter and more melodic and more mournful and more personal record than some of the records I've made in the past.|$|R

2500|$|According to Elmore Magazines Mike Jurkovic, when It's Too Late To Stop Now {{was first}} {{released}} in 1974, [...] "everyone—and I do mean everyone—tripped over themselves to hail the two-LP set {{as one of}} the greatest live renderings of the rock era." [...] Reviewing the album in Creem, Robert Christgau hailed it as Morrison's best since Moondance (1970) while writing, [...] "Songs that wore poorly or were just lame in the first place have more force and tightness <b>here</b> than <b>in</b> their <b>studio</b> versions". Ken Emerson was somewhat less impressed in Rolling Stone: [...] "On It's Too Late Morrison's voice is in fine form, but much else is not...The other musicians, most of whom have played with Morrison many times before, never detract, but Morrison could be better served....But the power of Morrison's vocals overcomes these drawbacks." [...] At the end of 1974, It's Too Late to Stop Now was voted the 20th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics, published by The Village Voice. Ellen Willis, Greil Marcus, and Christgau ranked it 2nd, 6th, and 18th, respectively, in their ballots for the poll.|$|R
