5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the <b>galleys</b> at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and <b>galleys,</b> and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the <b>galleys</b> while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of <b>galleys</b> that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan <b>galleys,</b> the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian <b>galleys,</b> other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
5|$|Venice {{could not}} {{directly}} confront the large Ottoman expeditionary force on Crete, {{but it did}} possess a fine navy, that could intervene and cut the Ottoman supply routes.

40|$|We {{present a}} new generic {{classification}} of the largely Southern Hemisphere grass subfamily Danthonioideae. This classification {{is based on}} an almost completely sampled and well-resolved molecular phylogeny and on a complete morphological data set. We have attempted to delimit monophyletic genera (complicated by the presence of apparent intergeneric hybridization), which are diagnosable, as well as morphologically and ecogeographically coherent. We recognize 17 genera, including five new genera (Austroderia N. P. Barker & H. P. Linder, Capeochloa H. P. Linder & N. P. Barker, Chimaerochloa H. P. Linder, Geochloa H. P. Linder & N. P. Barker, and Tenaxia N. P. Barker & H. P. Linder), and two sections newly designated for Pentameris P. Beauv. (section Dracomontanum H. P. Linder & <b>Galley</b> and section Pentaschistis (Nees) H. P. Linder & <b>Galley).</b> Of the remaining 12 genera, the delimitations of seven are changed: Merxmuellera Conert is much reduced by the segregation of Geochloa, Capeochloa, and Tenaxia; Pentameris is expanded to include Prionanthium Desv. and Pentaschistis (Nees) Spach; Cortaderia Stapf is expanded by the inclusion of Lamprothyrsus Pilg., but reduced by the segregation of its New Zealand species into the new genus Austroderia; a large Rytidosperma Steud. is assembled out of Joycea H. P. Linder, Austrodanthonia H. P. Linder, Notodanthonia Zotov, Erythranthera Zotov, Pyrrhanthera Zotov, and Monostachya Merr.; and the species previously assigned to Karroochloa Conert & Türpe, Schismus P. Beauv., Urochlaena Nees, and Tribolium Desv. have been reassigned to only two genera. Finally, the Himalayan species of Danthonia DC. are transferred to Tenaxia and the remaining African species of Danthonia to Merxmuellera. The 281 species that we recognize in the subfamily are listed under their new genera, which are arranged in the phylogenetic sequence evident from the molecular phylogeny.

5|$|What {{happened}} when the Spanish <b>galleys</b> came under fire of the English ships differs depending on sources: from one side it is asserted that the San Felipe was nearly battered into submission by Victory's guns and she was only able to escape when the other <b>galleys</b> came up in support drawing Victory's and Hopes fire. On the other hand, it is also claimed that Spinola's <b>galleys</b> succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength. Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible; instead of concentrating on one galley, he ordered his guners to blaze away at anything they saw in the moonlight {{and as a result}} be believed that damage was inflicted on most of the <b>galleys.</b> A number of <b>galleys</b> slaves leapt into the sea from the damaged ships - a few even made it to shore where they were captured and interrogated at Dover Castle. By the time both fleets reached Goodwin Sands the Spanish <b>galleys</b> started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast. A gale was now blowing strongly from the West which also hampered Spanish attempts and they were hotly pursued by the English ships and soon the gunfire warnings were signals for the Dutch to engage.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the <b>galleys</b> they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than <b>galleys,</b> but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Galleys</b> were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The <b>galleys</b> also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to <b>galleys,</b> its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against <b>galleys,</b> matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|Orbetello {{was erected}} in a spit between two inner bays {{of a big}} lagoon. Various {{fortified}} positions made it a strong defensive position: Porto Ercole at the east, San Stefano at the west, and the fort San Filippo on the Monte Argentario island, linked to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. In the end, the French army landed at Talamone, where Brézé left to the Prince a half-dozen of vessels and <b>galleys</b> to bombard the forts of the town. Meanwhile, he went to Porto San Stefano with 5 sailing ships and 4 <b>galleys</b> and bombarded the fort until it surrendered. After the loss of those positions, Don Carlo de la Gatta, the castillan of Orbetello, retreated to the hermitage of Cristo. The isthmus was occupied thanks to a battery mounted aboard the French <b>galleys,</b> and soon the lagoon was filled with armed boats gathered by Jean-Paul de Saumeur, Chevalier Paul. Don Carlo de la Gatta, supported by just 200 Spanish and Italian soldiers, had very few opportunities to resist without help. An early relief force of 35 boats and 5 escort <b>galleys</b> sent from Naples with munitions and supplies was beaten, so a major fleet action was expected.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema {{replaced}} the <b>galleys</b> {{that had made}} up {{the core of the}} Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to <b>galleys,</b> the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.|$|E

5|$|When news of {{the siege}} reached Spain, Philip IV gave orders to {{assemble}} a relief fleet. Second-hand goods were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country. The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha, Count of Linhares, who was Captain General of the <b>Galleys</b> of the Mediterranean, and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea. He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men-of-war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron; the later providing 8 frigates. At least 3,300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief. Linhares' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta, who displeased by his always secondary role, had recently resigned, claiming ill health. While Pimienta would {{be in charge of}} the sailing ships, Linhares would do so with the <b>galleys.</b> Once at sea, the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 <b>galleys</b> from the squadrons of Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Sicily, which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 <b>galleys.</b> Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Admiral de Maille Brézé, in the meantime, could be reinforced by the divisions of Montade and Saint-Tropez, and was able to oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 <b>galleys.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Manuel I and the {{subsequent}} demise of the Komnenian dynasty in 1185, the navy declined swiftly. The maintenance of <b>galleys</b> and the upkeep of proficient crews were very expensive, and neglect led to a rapid deterioration of the fleet. Already by 1182 the Byzantines had to pay Venetian mercenaries to crew some of their <b>galleys,</b> but in the 1180s, as {{the bulk of the}} Komnenian naval establishment persisted, expeditions of 70–100 ships are still recorded in contemporary sources. Thus Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183–1185) could still gather 100 warships in 1185 to resist and later defeat a Norman fleet in the Sea of Marmara. However, the subsequent peace treaty included a clause which required the Normans to furnish a fleet for the Empire. This, together with a similar agreement made by Isaac II Angelos (1185–1195 and 1203–1204) with Venice the next year, in which the Republic would provide 40–100 <b>galleys</b> at six months' notice in exchange for favourable trading concessions, is a telling indication that the Byzantine government was aware of the inadequacy of its own naval establishment.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Constantinople a {{few months}} later however, Michael VIII was able to focus his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the defeat of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing Venetian–Genoese war, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 <b>galleys</b> besieged the town of Oreos in Negroponte (Euboea), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 <b>galleys.</b> This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Henceforth, {{the impoverished}} Byzantine state became a pawn {{of the great}} powers of the day, trying to survive by {{exploiting}} their rivalries. Thus, for instance, in 1351, Kantakouzenos was induced to side with Venice in its war with Genoa, but, abandoned by the Venetian admirals, his fleet was easily defeated by the Genoese and {{he was forced to}} sign an unfavourable peace. During the brief usurpation of John VII in 1390, Manuel II (1391–1425) was able to gather only five <b>galleys</b> and four smaller vessels (including some from the Hospitallers of Rhodes) to recapture Constantinople and rescue his father John V. Six years later, Manuel promised to arm ten ships to assist the Crusade of Nicopolis; twenty years later, he personally commanded 4 <b>galleys</b> and 2 other vessels carrying some infantry and cavalry, and saved the island of Thasos from an invasion. Byzantine ships were active throughout the Ottoman Interregnum, when Byzantium sided with various rival Ottoman princes in turn. Manuel used his ships to ferry the rival pretenders and their forces across the Straits. With Genoese assistance, Manuel's fleet was also able to muster a fleet of eight <b>galleys</b> and capture Gallipoli in May 1410, albeit for a brief time; and in August 1411, the Byzantine fleet was instrumental in the failure of a siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman prince Musa Çelebi, when it defeated Musa's attempt to blockade the city by sea as well.
