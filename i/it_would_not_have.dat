5|$|A run {{scored by}} a runner who {{advances}} {{due to an}} error or passed ball is unearned, unless <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{made a difference in}} the reconstruction of the inning.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{portrayal}} of Germans as the antagonists of the story, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been appropriate for Land of Black Gold to continue serialisation under Nazi occupation.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to be painted {{to protect it from}} the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are talking}} nonsense. You are not serious. You are not {{telling me the}} truth. I don't believe that you {{attempted}} {{to make love to}} her. You <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> played such a game as that. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> been honorable." ...|$|R

60|$|A {{very faint}} murmur {{came to their}} ears, so faint that <b>had</b> <b>not</b> his {{attention}} been drawn to <b>it</b> Tom <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> noticed <b>it</b> at all.|$|R
5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on {{what had been the}} greyhound track. It {{would turn out to be}} the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been elevated.|$|E
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> affected operation of the engines.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, you are {{not going}} to tell them. Perhaps they won't miss <b>it.</b> I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done <b>it</b> if Stanhope <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been such a beast,' said Herbert.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not know}} I was {{reasoning}} with a poet,' said the Doctor, with a smile. 'Had I been conscious of <b>it,</b> I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been so rash.' ...|$|R

5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to be released before November 2011, and likely would have been so large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal did {{not always}} play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium {{was used as an}} ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury's already limited {{capacity}} had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to host their 2000–01 campaign.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a bit. It's all a {{question}} of horizons; {{you look at it}} from too close. Put the horizon further back. You hit India in the wind, and say it's virtuous. Well, now let's see what happens. Either the wind never comes back, and India gasps to an untimely death, or the wind does come back, and in the pant of reaction your blow--that's to say your labour--is lost, morally lost labour that you might <b>have</b> spent where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> been lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wore it always. I almost {{think that}} I {{never saw her}} hand without <b>it.</b> He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> given you that unless he had meant {{to be very good}} to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Clare {{part of the}} {{constituency}} {{had been}} included since 1923 in the Clare constituency. However, {{it was only a}} small area of County Clare (a sparsely-populated part of the mountainous area in the north-east of the county centered around Tulla), and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been anomalous to have simply called it [...] "Galway South". Clare-Galway South also included a small part of County Roscommon.|$|R
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{role played by}} the blacksmiths of Makera Assada was during the jihad of Shehu Danfodiyo. The blacksmith apart from participating in the jihad, they also produce weapons for the jihadists. It is believed that, if the government had taken these kind of local smithing serious, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> been spending money and importing farm implement and other iron products from abroad. Iron working made farming, hunting and war more efficient. Iron allowed for greater growth in societies with the ability to support large kingdoms, which spread across western Africa.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} we do both wish to make it up," [...] said Clym. [...] "If she <b>had</b> wished <b>it,</b> <b>would</b> she <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sent to me by this time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{want to be}} sure of it myself." [...] "You are. That was why {{you asked}} me if I loved you. Had you not been sure of <b>it</b> you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> asked." ...|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out. It gave Hugh Dowding AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Fighter Command, the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces. The British, possibly {{through the use of}} Ultra intelligence, recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks on the capital. ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been easy for him to shoot himself in {{the right side of the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> appeared as such on the database; it would only note {{that the child was}} receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was silly}} {{of me to}} warn her that Arthur should have his share; but after all, I don't regret <b>it.</b> I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> on false pretences. Did you hear when the will was dated?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately I {{have some}} money with me," [...] she said; [...] "but {{you may as}} well take the five dollars, for unless Uncle had been willing to pay <b>it</b> he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> called you back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had to do}} it," [...] said Frank. [...] "Let {{things go}} as they might, {{you had to do}} <b>it.</b> You <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> said of you that you had joined these ruffians against your father." ...|$|R
5|$|The planning, {{design and}} {{development}} phases of Millennium {{took place over}} five years. The first rumors that a new record-breaking roller coaster would be built at Cedar Point, which included speculation about a ten inversion roller coaster from Bolliger & Mabillard and an Arrow Dynamics MegaLooper, began circulating in early 1998. A roller coaster from D. H. Morgan Manufacturing was also rumored. On July 2, 1999, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Millennium Force, which raised more speculation about what the ride would be like. About a week later, the first track pieces were seen at the park, which confirmed that the ride would be manufactured by Intamin. Cedar Point officials also confirmed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> inversions.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E
60|$|The trap {{was placed}} upon a small stone {{by the side}} of a larger one. It was in a very snug and {{sheltered}} place, almost out of view. In fact <b>it</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been observed by any ordinary passer-by.|$|R
60|$|To {{his vast}} relief {{he saw that}} Palliser {{clutched}} at the suggestion. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> perhaps <b>not</b> <b>have</b> appeared very conclusive to another man, but Palliser was anxious as well as willing to be convinced, which makes a difference.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should know}} that piece of iron," [...] said the warder bluntly, yet with some change in his voice; [...] "for I have known a man within side of <b>it</b> who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> endured half the {{impertinence}} I have heard spoken to-day." ...|$|R
