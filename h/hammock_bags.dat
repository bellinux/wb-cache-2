50|$|Elite {{women were}} also given the {{opportunity}} to work with the most expensive feathers and pearl beads. However, women of the elite not only had to prepare the best clothing for their families, but they also had to be talented in weaving tapestry, brocade, embroidery, and tie-dyeing for tribute to other families and rulers. Weavers had three different natural dyes to work with. Women also worked with maguey. Maguey was of major value as a cordage material used for horse gear, nets, <b>hammocks</b> and <b>bags.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Amuzgo have {{a number}} of crafts such as pottery (pots, comals, jars, etc.), <b>hammocks,</b> ixtle <b>bags,</b> baskets and more. In Xochistlahuaca, machetes are made with {{etchings}} related to the culture of the region. Everyone in the family participates in some kind of handcraft production, divided by gender. Girls are taught to weave and sew cloth and boys learn to weave nets and hammocks. The best known craft, however, is the weaving of cloth by Amuzgo women, especially in Xochistlahuaca as it is often sold to vendors outside the region.|$|R
50|$|Astrocaryum chambira (Chambira palm) is a palm {{native to}} Amazon Rainforest {{vegetation}} in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant which has edible endosperm and fruit. It has a commercial value {{because it has}} excellent fibers which {{may be used for}} <b>bags,</b> <b>hammocks,</b> ropes, string instruments, and many crafts. In addition, it is also used as a medicinal plant. Boiled and desiccated, its bark is used as a source of salt by the Witoto people of the Amazon.|$|R
50|$|Hand-made or machine-made net {{is used as}} the {{foundation}} fabric for many kinds of needlework, including Filet lace and tambour lace. Netting {{can be used for}} many things. This includes adding fullness to a dress. Most commonly wedding and prom dresses. It is also used for many costumes, including fairy outfits. Netting {{can also be used to}} make tutus for dancing costumes. Netting can also be referred to when considering the handmade craft. Using either the Lace-maker or the Net-maker method to tie the netting knot, you can create several types of netting. Diamond mesh netting goes back and forth, in rows. This technique is used for <b>bags,</b> <b>hammocks,</b> headbands and scarves. Another type is square mesh netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling.The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to knitting or crochet. There’s no beginning or ending to specific rounds since the pattern is continuous and just keeps going.|$|R
40|$|To {{survive and}} travel within environments {{that do not}} {{accommodate}} the body, humans have designed tools that allow for adaptation. Through sculptural processes I have investigated the idea that humans construct {{various aspects of the}} external world based on a reflected understanding of the internal workings of the human body and its limitations. By drawing on forms such as the lifeboat, sleeping <b>bag,</b> <b>hammock</b> and aeronautical equipment, together with utilising my own dimensions as a design tool I have created a group of non-representational sculptures. It is my intention to explore how these sculptures can evoke possible shelters, adaptive vehicles and imaginary human carapaces. Conceptually this process alludes to structures and vehicles that transport the occupant beyond an imaginary set of physiological confinements. Various industrial materials such as rubber, timber, steel and fabric have been utilised, their inherent qualities contributing to design choices made within the construction process. I have investigated materials and construction techniques that reveal the making process, and present form and surface as problems to be resolved on an equal footing. A significant aspect of the project is the contribution made to the content of the work by time intensive methods of labour, together with specific material choices. Collectively the works share aspects of construction in that a skeletal framework configures each piece: cladding or exposure of this framework varying with each sculpture. Within the project I have researched the work of Lucy Orta, Antony Gormley and Martin Puryear to inform my research about shelter, dimensional design and formal concerns regarding material use and form...|$|R
