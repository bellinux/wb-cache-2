50|$|Scolytus schevyrewi, the banded <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle, is a 3-4 mm long <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle {{species in}} the genus Scolytus native from Asia and accidentally {{introduced}} to North America. It is a vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi.

40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of <b>bark</b> <b>lice</b> and parasitic lice (Insecta: Psocodea) {{have been studied}} {{in a number of}} recent molecular phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences. Many of these studies have focused on the position of parasitic lice within the free-living <b>bark</b> <b>lice.</b> However, fewer such studies have examined the relationships among major groups of free-living <b>bark</b> <b>lice</b> and their implications for classification. In this study we focus on the infraorder Caeciliusetae, a large group of <b>bark</b> <b>lice</b> (˜ 1000 species) within the suborder Psocomorpha. Using sequences of two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, we estimated the phylogeny for relationships among the five recognized families within the infraorder Caeciliusetae. Based on the results, the sister-group relationship and respective monophyly of Stenopsocidae and Dasydemellidae is strongly supported. Monophyly of the larger families Amphipsocidae and Caeciliusidae was not supported, although the causes of this were the placement of two distinct subfamilies (Paracaeciliinae and Calocaeciliinae). The monophyly of Asiopsocidae could not be tested because it was sampled only by one species. Based on these results and consideration of morphological characters, we propose a new classification for Caeciliusetae, recognizing six families: Amphipsocidae, Stenopsocidae, Dasydemellidae, Asiopsocidae, Paracaeciliidae and Caeciliusidae. We expect that this new classification will stabilize the higher-level taxonomy of this group and help to identify groups in need of further work among these insects...|$|R

5000|$|A {{bark beetle}} {{is one of}} about 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the {{subfamily}} Scolytinae.

40|$|While it is {{well known}} that changes in the general {{processes}} of molecular evolution have occurred on a variety of timescales, the mechanisms underlying these changes are less well understood. Parasitic lice ("Phthiraptera") and their close relatives (infraorder Nanopsocetae of the insect order Psocodea) are a group of insects well known for their unusual features of molecular evolution. We examined changes in base composition across parasitic <b>lice</b> and <b>bark</b> <b>lice.</b> We identified substantial differences in percent GC content between the clade comprising parasitic lice plus closely related <b>bark</b> <b>lice</b> (=Nanopsocetae) versus all other <b>bark</b> <b>lice.</b> These changes occurred for both nuclear and mitochondrial protein coding and ribosomal RNA genes, often in the same direction. To evaluate whether correlations in base composition change also occurred within lineages, we used phylogenetically controlled comparisons, and in this case few significant correlations were identified. Examining more constrained sites (first/second codon positions and rRNA) revealed that, in comparison to the other <b>bark</b> <b>lice,</b> the GC content of parasitic lice and close relatives tended towards 50 % either up from less than 50 % GC or down from greater than 50 % GC. In contrast, less constrained sites (third codon positions) in both nuclear and mitochondrial genes showed less of a consistent change of base composition in parasitic lice and very close relatives. We conclude that relaxed selection on this group of insects is a potential explanation of the change in base composition for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, which could lead to nucleotide frequencies closer to random expectation (i. e., 50 % GC) in the absence of any mutation bias. Evidence suggests this relaxed selection arose once in the non-parasitic common ancestor of Phthiraptera + Nanopsocetae and is not directly related to the evolution of the parasitism in lice...|$|R

40|$|From {{the larvae}} and adults of the <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle Scolytus scolytus F. Ceratostomella ulmi could nearly always be isolated. The mite Pseudotarsonemo_des innumerabilis, {{living on the}} <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetles, was transported by them to the newly cut egg tunnels in the tree, from where the mites transported the spores of C. ulmi through the larval tunnels to the pupal cells, where they disseminated the spores {{in such a way}} that these form a typical sward of coremia. In the absence of mites this was always lacking in the pupal cells. The {{dispersal}} of elm disease by other insects proved improbable. The exact relation between the quantity of <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetles and the occurrence of new outbreaks of elm disease could be established. The different feeding techniques of S. scolytus were studied both in field and laboratory trials. The generations of these beetles were compared for different meteorological conditions. The number of generations varied greatly. Both 4 generations and (as a rule) 1 generation a year were observed. They always overlapped, so there were no periods without beetles. Breeding material had to satisfy special requirements. These requirements and the way, in which a pile of wood was attacked, were fully discussed. After explaining that control of the fungus was not possible, Fransen concluded that the only way to combat the elm disease was to destroy <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetles.
