50|$|Earlier {{paintings}} depict men {{and women}} working on the farm or at home. Later images show trades people engaged in their work, such as blacksmith, chemist, cobbler, cork maker, glass blower, or taxidermist. The most recent works are images of machines and men embodying the paradoxes of industrialism of the mid-18th century to post-World War II. These works, often commissioned by the factory's owner, are exterior views of steel mills and foundries surrounded by trains and tracks or <b>dark</b> <b>factory</b> interiors where glowing molten metal is juxtaposed with factory workers and managers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Alegría {{was adapted}} into {{a film of}} the same name, written by Rudy Barichello and {{directed}} by Franco Dragone. The cast included actors such as Frank Langella, Mako, Julie Cox, René Bazinet and a guest appearance from Whoopi Goldberg, {{as well as several}} performers and musicians from the touring production (many appeared in both this film and the Alegría DVD). The film employs a conventional structured narrative as opposed to the abstract allegory of the live show. It {{tells the story of a}} boy named Momo who wants to save the children from their imprisonment in the <b>dark</b> <b>factory</b> of a cruel man named Marcello. Momo's only friend, a quirky clown named Frac, aids him, while also falling in love with the singer of a circus named Giulietta passing through town. The children turn against Marcello (who is also known as the Dragon) by throwing rocks at him. The pair soon find their destinies increasingly entwined with that of the circus. The fluffy white rabbit is the only animal in the film and the songs [...] "Let Love Live", [...] "Child in His Eyes", [...] "Love Leaves Someone Behind" [...] and [...] "Mountain of Clothes" [...] are sung by Irène Marc.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game has}} {{two kinds of}} barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell {{factories}} (spell <b>factory</b> and <b>dark</b> spell <b>factory).</b> The barracks create troops using elixir (Barbarian, Archer, Giant, Goblin, Wall Breaker, Balloon, Wizard, Healer, Dragon, P.E.K.K.A, Baby Dragon, and Miner) whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.

All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.|$|R

5000|$|Factory tint, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Privacy Glass" [...] is an electrical process called [...] "deep dipping" [...] that involves dying the inside of automotive glass with a <b>dark</b> pigment. <b>Factory</b> tint is standard on the rear half of most new trucks and SUV's. With a common visual light transmission (VLT) of 15%-26%, factory window tint is installed to provide passengers and personal items privacy from outsiders, hence the name privacy glass. Since most states have a VLT legal limit of around 35% for the front driver windows and windshield, factory tint is only applied to the rear half of vehicles windows to avoid breaking the law.|$|R
5000|$|Philip Stone and Richard Sharpley {{from the}} Department of Tourism and Leisure Management of the Lancashire Business School at the University of Central Lancashire, UK have {{looked through the}} lens of the market place at dark tourism; they have coined the term 'product of dark tourism', and discuss its supply, demand, and {{consumption}} by the 'dark tourist'. Stone and Sharpley have published prolifically in this area, although not conducted empirical research, and founded an Institute for Dark Tourism. In 2005 Stone suggested that [...] "within contemporary society people regularly consume death and suffering in touristic form, seemingly in the guise of education and/or entertainment", and sounded a call for research on [...] "Dark Tourism Consumption" [...] to [...] "establish consumer behavior models that incorporate contemporary socio-cultural aspects of death and dying."

50|$|Stone distinguishes seven dark {{suppliers}}, which {{create the}} dark tourism product and experience. The model of seven dark suppliers demonstrate dark tourism as multi-faceted phenomenon, with the extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau conceivably the darkest {{in terms of}} influence. The Dark Camps of Genocide are sites where genocide and violence were actually perpetrated. All such sites belong to this category. Auschwitz was {{the largest of the}} Nazi death camps in World War II, and {{is at the top of}} this list. Holocaust sites usually depend on government's sponsorship. Among the seven dark suppliers are also war sites and battlefields (Dark Conflict Sites), places of remembrances (Dark Shrines), cemeteries of famous people (Dark Resting Places), prisons and courthouses (Dark Dungeons), exhibits associated with death and suffering (Dark Exhibitions), and finally, the tourist sites which emphasize entertainment (<b>Dark</b> Fun <b>Factories).</b>|$|R
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a <b>dark,</b> gloomy <b>factory</b> in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{eternally}} busy city of Din, {{the black-and-white}} Rushers constantly {{go about their}} business in a fast-paced way and stop only to sleep, due to their Cosmic Clock being wound too tightly. Din lies between two worlds that create dreams to deliver to the sleeping Rushers - one is the bright and cheerful Frivoli, where Greensleeves and his Figmen of Imagination bring sweet dreams; and the other is the Murkworks, a <b>dark</b> and dingy <b>factory</b> home to vultures who drop nightmare bombs. The evil [...] Botch, maniacal ruler of the Murkworks, wants to foil Greenie's efforts and subject the Rushers to non-stop waking nightmares. He uses his vultures to kidnap the Figs and Greensleeves, but not before Greensleeves writes an S.O.S. to Frivoli.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are usually}} three trains per day, each way between Havana Casablanca and Matanzas, meeting at Hershey Station, the midpoint. The early morning and later {{afternoon}} trains allow commuters {{to go to}} work at the end-points, the mid-day provides supplementary service. The end-to-end time is approximately 3 1/2 hours. The service can be irregular and journeys may be truncated without prior notice. [...] The main stops are at Guanabo, Hershey, San Mateo, Jibaco, Canasi, San Antonio and Matanzas, which have modest station buildings. There are also other stops with small platforms and there can be numerous intermediate halts at road crossings serviced on demand. There are four branches from the main line in current use, running to Playas del Este, Jaruco, Bainoa and Santa Cruz del Norte. There is local passenger service from Callé 7 Station in Hershey (near the maintenance facility) to San Antonio de Rio Blanco and Jaruco. There may also still be local passenger service from Hershey Station to Caraballo on the Bainoa branch. These are rarely used since 2000, but in the summer months, diesel hauled excursion trains run from Havana's La Coubre station to Playas del Este, a popular destination for city dwellers. Other branches exists but have not been used in recent years. The branch to the Havana Club <b>dark</b> rum <b>factory</b> in Santa Cruz del Norte is no longer electrified and tank cars of molasses are delivered by diesel locomotives running out of Matanzas.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Where {{industry}} {{was once the}} backbone of community, it has since been relegated to sprawling industrial zones, {{on the edges of}} community, divorced from the people who benefit from its labors. However, a certain renaissance in "making" is evident in the Maker's Revolution. The typical manufacturing facilities used today are not the <b>dark,</b> soot covered <b>factories</b> of the past. Processes have changed and building technologies have become more efficient. Yet, the resulting environment for manufacturing has developed to be little more than large, sprawling boxes, disconnected from their human occupants. Proposing a community education, co-working and manufacturing facility, this thesis is not intended to redefine the manufacturing process, but to address the physical environment in which it takes place, making it more fitting to the occupants therein. Scale, programmatic relationships and adaptability are used to explore various spatial experiences in which to interact, collaborate, and simply occupy...|$|R
40|$|Until around 1980 Japanese {{companies}} {{occupied a}} predominant position in Asia. In {{terms of the}} scale of operation, level of technology and international competitiveness, they surpassed local Asian companies. They enjoyed number one position. International business of Japanese companies in Asia had two characteristics. The first is so-called flying geese pattern of investment. 　Japanese companies invested first in relatively well developed countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea. Then, they shifted their investment to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. Lastly, their investment extended to China and Vietnam. The second characteristic is that their Asian operations are managed by Japanese persons using the Japanese language. CEOs and other top management at most Asian subsidiaries are Japanese expatriates. And they manage their companies having constant communication with their Japanese head offices in the Japanese language. Japanese companies in Asia have bright and <b>dark</b> aspects. <b>Factories</b> are bright {{in the sense that}} they achieve good performance with motivated local workers. Japanese production system works well at their Asian factories. On the other hand, administrative offices have problems. They do not attract high level local managerial, professional and engineering people. Limits of Japanese style international management are evident at the offices. In forecasting the future of Japanese business in Asia, China may be the most important factor. China has continued rather high level of economic growth for more than twenty years since its basic policy change in 1978. Will China's economy grow in the future? As the market economy will develop, the tension between the market economy and the politics of socialism will increase. Will the politics of one party system be able to coexist with the market economy? It may be that Japanese companies have already hit their peak of their overall international competitiveness in Asia. They might have already started to go on the declining process. They invest more in foreign countries than in Japan, which results in the hallowing of industry at home. They are facing various kinds of resistance to change such as so-called lifetime employment, existing organization routines, vested interests and sunk costs. Japanese companies are managed by old men and thus lack in strong leadership. ...|$|R
