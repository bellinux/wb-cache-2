5|$|This {{does not}} mean that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of an El Niño event. The <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, but it had one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the team out of spring {{training}} and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in the minors.

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to climb in the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Following No Surrender, Raven {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino {{attacked}} Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team {{with him in a}} Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in which if Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett then he would not garner one for an <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an <b>entire</b> <b>year,</b> most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E

He began his career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 10 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts. That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but {{turned out to be a}} non-cancerous tumor in his back. He had it removed in February 2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed the <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> while undergoing a second surgery.|$|E

In {{the first nine months}} of the year, the company handled 276,000tonnes of cargo, representing a growth rate of 20% achieved by that company. The cargo volume projected for the <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> was estimated at 345,000tonnes, including 6,170TEUs. The growth was permitted by investments made in late 2007, and the increased volume of operation brought about profit of approximately 2.4million kuna (325,000euro) in {{the first nine months of}} 2008.

5|$|Johns Hopkins University, located {{north of}} the Naval Academy, in Baltimore, started their {{football}} program a couple years after Navy. Hopkins' first team was assembled in 1881, and spent an <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> training and learning {{a version of the}} game. Their sport, which was closer to rugby, was played in Druid Hill Park. After the training, the team planned a two-game 1882 season. The squad had to play the season under the title of the Clifton Athletic Club, due to the school's policy on the sport of football. The first was a practice game with the Baltimore Athletic Club, played on October 7. The Hopkins team lost the contest 4–0. The following game was their first true game, to be played against the Naval Academy.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette {{was held}} at Nivelles, then {{transferred}} to Luxembourg where a coalition military tribunal declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until a restored French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal's order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party travelled to the Prussian fortress-city of Wesel, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the central citadel from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the Rhineland, King Frederick WilliamII transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at Magdeburg, where they remained an <b>entire</b> <b>year,</b> from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.|$|E

Mitchell became the fourth receiver again after the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season and caught only twelve passes the <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help led the team to a win in overtime.

5|$|The {{process of}} Vietnam's {{colonisation}} began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam {{and attempted to}} proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River {{to the mouth of}} the Citadel of Saigon and opened fire with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for an <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{scale of}} Our Friends in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the <b>entire</b> <b>year.</b> Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E
5|$|William {{returned}} to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly {{returned to}} Normandy, {{where he spent}} all of 1074. He left England {{in the hands of}} his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an <b>entire</b> <b>year</b> was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the Ætheling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, then proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, however, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.|$|E
