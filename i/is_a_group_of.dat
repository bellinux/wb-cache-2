5|$|A {{haplotype}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> genes {{found in}} an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, {{which suggests that the}} mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of modern wolves with those from Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two modern Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that there once existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> genes {{found in}} an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the golden jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals {{from all of the}} other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant golden jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the golden jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, a {{historic}} district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> buildings, properties, or sites {{that have been}} designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant.
