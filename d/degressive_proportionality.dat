40|$|AbstractOne of {{the basic}} {{socio-economic}} problems {{is the problem of}} distribution of benefits and dues. The historically shaped principles of justice direct the {{solution to the problem of}} the Aristotelian rule of proportionality. But applying this rule not always gives the expected, satisfactory solutions. This occurs, for instance, regarding the allocation of seats among the member states in the European Parliament. For this reason, the principle of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality</b> was legitimized. Although the definition appears in the context of the European Parliament, the application of the rule distribution may be much wider due to certain universal priorities it embodies. The principle of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality,</b> however, has a significant drawback, namely, it does not clearly provide a exact division. This lack of clarity results in the fact that within the rule there may appear many different proposals.

40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} {{of seats in}} the European Parliament {{in accordance with the}} provisions of the Lisbon Treaty is of a degressively proportional nature. 751 seats are distributed among the 27 Member States {{with the use of a}} principle which is in some way a response to the need of constructing a division that ensures adequate representation of the smallest members of the community. There are many feasible solutions however - unfortunately, no unambiguous manner of such allocation has yet been put forward. Therefore, the current seat distribution has been chosen through political negotiations. It turns out that a number of seats are not subject to such negotiations. When performing the distribution and preserving boundary conditions, a certain number of seats gets allocated to individual countries independently of negotiations, but only through the application of the principle of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality.</b> This paper explores the problem of determining the scale of actual political negotiations. It presents the minimum and maximum number of mandates which can be granted to specific Member States.

A federal assembly consists of a number of representatives for each of the nations (states, Länder, cantons [...] .) that make up the federation. In determining the constitution of such an assembly there is the following tension. On the one hand, we may think of the federation as a federation of nation states. This would support a model of equal representation, i. e. a model in which each nation has the same numbe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe most {{recognizable}} historically approved methods of proportional division of mandates in collegiate bodies refer to an ideal assumption where each vote {{is associated with}} identical number of representatives. Proportional methods of distribution such as Hamilton's and divisor methods of Jefferson, Adams or Webster cannot be directly applied to the allocation of seats between the Member States in the European Parliament because of the wide variation in their population. A desire to ensure appropriate representation have triggered legal acceptance of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality</b> rule contained in the Lisbon Treaty. The new principle, however, does not allow determining an unambiguous solution. The article presents the allocations which can be obtained reaching the classical methods of proportional division, taking into account degressively proportional allocation functions...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} well known {{measures}} of the inequality of distribution of goods and burdens. One of them is for example the Gini coefficient. Applicability of such measures is limited when the use of disproportionate allocation was intended. This {{is the case in}} the allocation of seats in the European Parliament. The Treaty of Lisbon provides that the distribution is done according to <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality</b> with the specified minimum and maximum number of seats allocated to the smallest and largest Member State. These two conditions called boundary conditions at the outset determine the deviation from the proportional division. Therefore, there arises a problem of determining the measure of the disproportion of allocation under the given boundary conditions. This article comprises the proposals for such measures and their application for the analysis of the distribution of seats in the European Parliament...|$|E
40|$|A federal {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} number of representatives for each of the nations (states, Länder, cantons, [...] .) that make up the federation. How many representatives should each nation receive? What makes this issue worth quibbling about is that the model of representation that is instituted {{will have an impact on}} the welfare distribution over the nations in the federation that will ensue over due course. We will investigate what models of representation yield welfare distributions that score higher on a utilitarian measure. First, we construct a continuum of models of representation ranging from equal to proportional representation. In between these extremes are models of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality.</b> We run a Monte-Carlo simulation in which a large number of motions are voted up or down within different contexts of evaluation and investigate how well the resulting welfare distributions score on the utilitarian measure. Subsequently, we will provide matching analytical results for a slightly idealized case. We conclude with a discussion of the significance of our results and of the role of simulations and analytical results and point to further work...|$|E
40|$|While {{there are}} many ways to define {{democratic}} representation, all include the need for a representative assembly elected by universal suffrage. EU member states divide almost evenly between those in which this assembly is the sole chamber in a unicameral parliament or one chamber in a bicameral parliament. The European Parliament is a deviant case because it is a unicameral parliament in which the principle of one European citizen, one vote, one value is explicitly rejected by the application of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality</b> in relating seats to national population. The first section of this paper sets out the different units and ways in which second chambers are constituted in European and major federal political systems. The extent of inequality in the EP is then compared with measures of inequality in first and second chambers in two major federal systems, the United States and Germany. The concluding section reviews proposals for institutional reform that might balance the EP's "federal" approachto representation with alternatives that might or might not give greater weight to the votes to individuals qua European citizens...|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{following}} two seemingly unrelated questions. First, why does Rousseau (1993 [1762]) believe that the formation of factions or partial associations is not conducive to the general will in Du Contrat Social, II, 3 ? Second, why do federal assemblies typically strive for some form of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality,</b> i. e. a balance between equal and proportional representation, for {{the countries in the}} federation? We will show that there is a surprising connection between these questions. We turn to our first question. It is often thought that Rousseau’s oppo-sition to factions can be interpreted in reference to the Condorcet Jury Theorem (e. g. Grofman and Feld 1988). The Condorcet Jury Theorem states that if voters {{are more likely to be}} right on some issue than not and cast their votes independently, then the chance that the majority is correct converges to one as the number of voters goes to infinity. This interpre-tation is supported by Rousseau’s claim that ‘If, when a sufficiently informed people deliberates, the citizens were to have no communicatio...|$|E
40|$|Distribution {{of seats}} in The European Parliament {{postulated}} by Treaty of Lisbon should be degressively proportional. The meaning of degressively proportional concept {{can be found in}} two principles annexed to the draft of European Parliament resolution. The first, referred as the principle of fair division, states that "the larger the population of a Member State, the greater is entitlement to a large number of seats". The other condition, referred to as the principle of relative proportionality, holds that "the larger the population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its Members of the EU". We postulate a clear and fair method which determines uniquely a distribution {{of seats in}} the European Parliament which fulfil the requirements of <b>degressive</b> <b>proportionality.</b> More generally, let $l_i$ be any non-increasing sequence of real positive numbers. We say that a sequence of natural numbers $m_{i}$ is degressively proportional with respect to the sequence $l_{i}$, if $m_{i}$ and $l_{i}/m_{i}$ are non-increasing sequences. Our method can be instrumental in uniquely determining a degressively proportional sequence $m_{i}$ with respect to $l_{i}$ which fulfils given conditions. Comment: 18 pages, 7 table...|$|E
