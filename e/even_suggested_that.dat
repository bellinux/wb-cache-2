5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the Teacher of Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{media were}} often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for {{emphasizing}} Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities and taste for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior. Other commentators <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Amin had deliberately cultivated his eccentric {{reputation in the}} foreign media as an easily parodied buffoon in order to defuse international concern over his administration of Uganda.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a revision of}} the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} nuclear and mitochondrial data. They showed that the springbok and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) form a clade with saiga (Saiga tatarica) as sister taxon. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably {{different from the rest of}} the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other studies have {{suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was while}} Edward was in York that he ordered the {{rehabilitation}} of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had had, and have <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him {{for the loss of}} the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} study on metacognition, {{measures}} of metamemory (such as study time allocation) and executive function were found to decline with age.

25|$|The {{background}} {{and purpose of}} The Alphabet of Ben-Sira is unclear.

25|$|Since the {{conflict}} {{took place at}} a very early point in Greek history, before historiography had developed, there are no contemporaneous written sources on the events. The few later sources and the much more copious archaeological evidence allow for a sketchy picture of the Lelantine War.

Some authors have <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the war may be entirely mythical or even fictional.|$|E
25|$|Periodicals of {{the time}} {{sometimes}} casually named known sodomites, {{and at one point}} <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the Tuileries, even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{the sinking of the}} Clan Ranald is still undetermined. Many {{theories}} have been put forward to try to explain it. One of these theories was that the vessel struck Marion Reef. However, this was dismissed, as an inspection of the hull revealed that there were no holes that indicated that the vessel hit any underwater obstruction. Other theories include the water ballast tanks were not emptied or that the sea cock was opened throughout the journey. Some <b>even</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> most of the crew were drunk at that time.|$|E
