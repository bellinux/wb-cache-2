5|$|As Haiti's {{economic}} situation <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> {{during the second}} Aristide presidency, demonstrations proliferated everywhere throughout the nation and political dialogue broke down between opposition leaders and the Aristide government. Carney, who spoke at the inaugural event and later {{went on to become}} Chairman of the Board for the project, raised concerns about whether the United States government was paying attention to the gravity of problems that were beginning to affect Haiti's stability systemically.|$|E

5|$|By 1985 Lihau's health <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> and he {{attempted}} to seek political asylum abroad. After his application to Belgian authorities was refused, he was granted political asylum in the United States. He moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and became a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University. In 1988 a dozen party executives traveled to Boston and convinced Lihau to assume the vacated presidency of the UDPS. The following year Lihau founded a political conference {{with the goal of}} democratising the Congo.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> {{to the extent}} that he was {{evacuated}} to Australia, and for a time was not expected to live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, dog shows, {{vaudeville}} performances, the horticultural show and various trade exhibitions continued at the Rink. By the 1920s, the building <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> and the gallery became unsafe to use.

5|$|In February 2007, {{thirty five}} Knesset members (MKs) {{wrote to the}} army asking them to open Joseph's Tomb to Jewish {{visitors}} for prayer. In May 2007, Breslov hasidim visited {{the site for the}} first time in two years and later on that year, a group of hasidim found that the gravesite had been cleaned up by the Palestinians. In the past few years the site had suffered from neglect and its appearance <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated,</b> with garbage being dumped and tires being burned there.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated.</b> Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|Sensing {{that there}} was growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, who were agitating for armed insurrection, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. However, Lenin's health <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> as he experienced headaches and insomnia and possibly began to experience the miniature heart attacks which would later afflict him. Nadezhda helped care for him, but was in poor health herself. He left Petrograd for the Finnish village of Neivola, where he visited his friend Vladimir Bonch-Bruevich to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers {{as an indication of}} a possible conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> by this point, and {{for all intents and}} purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1951, {{relationships}} <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> {{enough for}} Pollock, Newman, Still and Rothko to approach Betty Parsons {{with the idea}} of showing them exclusively, effectively leaving their erstwhile colleagues to fend for themselves. She declined the offer. Over the following three years Pollock, Still and Rothko moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery. After the failure of fellow artists to defend his show at Betty Parsons in 1951 and not been included in the 1952 Fifteen Americans show at the Museum of Modern Art, Newman did not show in New York again until 1959.|$|E

5|$|As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik {{with his}} Armenian Special Striking Division {{moved to the}} mountainous region of Zangezur {{to set up a}} defense. By mid-1918, the {{relations}} between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated.</b> Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection point between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.|$|E
5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E

Vick's first endorsement after {{being released from}} prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011 with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads. Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing {{marked the first time}} a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{broke out}} between the {{remnants}} of the East Timorese security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May. On 23 May Reinado's rebel group opened fire on F-FDTL and PNTL personnel in the Fatu Ahi area. On 24 May F-FDTL personnel near the Force's headquarters were attacked by a group of rebel police officers, petitioners and armed civilians. The attack was defeated when one of the F-FDTL naval component's patrol boats fired on the attackers. During the crisis the relationship between the F-FDTL and PNTL <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> further, and on 25 May members of the F-FDTL attacked the PNTL's headquarters, killing nine unarmed police officers.|$|E
5|$|George IV's {{relationship}} with his wife Caroline <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated</b> {{by the time of}} his accession. They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. In 1814, Caroline left the United Kingdom for continental Europe, but she chose to return for her husband's coronation, and to publicly assert her rights as queen consort. However, George IV refused to recognise Caroline as Queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline's name was omitted from the Book of Common Prayer, the liturgy of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 he {{debuted in}} film, {{but he only}} had modest success in the medium. He {{continued}} to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in Helen!, his first straight theatre role. His appearance {{brought him to the}} attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, Henry V. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health <b>had</b> <b>deteriorated,</b> and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted a few months before his death in 1954.|$|E
