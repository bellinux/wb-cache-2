25|$|Use of Ethernet by CobraNet {{offers many}} high {{availability}} {{features such as}} Spanning Tree Protocol, link aggregation, and network management. For critical applications, CobraNet devices can be wired with redundant connections to the network. In this configuration, if one CobraNet device, cable, or <b>Ethernet</b> <b>switch</b> fails, the other takes over almost immediately.|$|E
25|$|On {{the more}} {{traditional}} business side, Cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise-focused routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product lines, prompting the company to morph the successful Catalyst 6500 <b>Ethernet</b> <b>switch</b> into all-purpose Cisco 7600 routing platform. However, limits of IOS and aging Crescendo architecture also forced Cisco to look at merchant silicon in the carrier Ethernet segment. This resulted in a new ASR9000 product family intended to consolidate company's carrier ethernet and subscriber management business around EZChip-based hardware and IOS-XR. Cisco also expanded into new markets by acquisition—one example being a 2009 purchase of mobile specialist Starent Networks that resulted in ASR5000 product line.|$|E

5000|$|The Realtek Remote Control Protocol (RRCP), {{developed}} by Realtek, is an Application layer protocol, running directly over Ethernet frames.

This approach allows to avoid cost of including a processor, RAM, Flash memory, etc. in a managed <b>Ethernet</b> <b>switch.</b> Instead, all [...] "intelligence" [...] is targeted to reside in a nearby computer, running special RRCP-aware <b>Ethernet</b> <b>switch</b> management software.|$|E

First, {{the behavior of a}} range of <b>Ethernet</b> <b>switches</b> when two long lived connections compete for the same output port is investigated. Then, the report explores the impact of these behaviors on TCP protocol in long and fast networks (LFNs). Several conditions in which scheduling mechanisms introduce heavy unfair bandwidth sharing and loss burst which impact TCP performance are shown.
