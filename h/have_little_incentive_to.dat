25|$|When {{the rule}} of law is absent, or private {{property}} is non-existent, farmers <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> improve their productivity. If a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms, it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government. Rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land, farmers may be content with the perceived safety of mediocrity.|$|E
25|$|One {{challenge}} in vaccine development is economic: Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> develop vaccines for these diseases, {{because there is}} little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.|$|E
25|$|African {{states did}} not develop more {{responsive}} institutions under colonial rule or post-independence. Colonial powers <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> develop state institutions to protect their colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the Berlin Conference. The colonizers instead focused on exploting natural resources and exploitation colonialism.|$|R
50|$|During {{colonialism}} {{or after}} independence, moreover, European colonial powers <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> develop state institutions {{to protect their}} colonies against invasion, having divided up Africa at the Berlin Conference. The colonizers instead focused on plundering natural resources through exploitation colonialism. The international state system enforced colonial boundaries of African states following independence, eroding any possible survival mandate.|$|R
50|$|Dick's {{last visit}} culminates in Roger confessing his {{love and the}} fact that he ensured that Isolda died pleasantly rather than succumb to a worse fate. Roger dies and Dick wakes. Since both Roger (his doppelganger/receptor) and Isolda are dead, Dick <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> return to the other world, but in any case there is no drug left to ease his passage there. As the book closes Dick {{attempts}} to pick up the phone but suddenly finds he is unable to grip it.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically consumers {{do not understand}} legal complexities and <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, {{it was still a}} misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E
25|$|In The Origins of Totalitarianism Hannah Arendt devotes {{a lengthy}} chapter to a {{critical}} analysis of human rights. Arendt isn’t skeptical {{of the notion of}} political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights. Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable and possessed simply in virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed in virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt’s primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty. She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.|$|E
2500|$|Lovins {{explains}} that {{many companies are}} already enjoying the financial and other rewards that come from saving electricity. Yet progress in converting to electricity saving technologies has been slowed by the indifference or outright opposition of some utilities. A second obstacle to efficiency is that many electricity-using devices are purchased by people who won’t be paying their running costs and thus <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> consider efficiency. [...] Lovins also believes that many customers [...] "don't know what the best efficiency buys are, where to get them, or how to shop for them".|$|E
50|$|In Asia, a revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its assault. Marcus Aurelius {{sent his}} co-emperor Lucius Verus {{to command the}} legions in the East. Lucius was {{authoritative}} enough to command the full loyalty of the troops, but already powerful enough that he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> overthrow Marcus. The plan succeeded—Verus remained loyal until his death, while on campaign, in 169.|$|R
50|$|In many instances, the {{initiative}} proponents may {{also need to}} file {{a lawsuit against the}} local government to compel the local government to prepare and issue the ballot title and summary. This generally provides a speedier remedy for {{the initiative}} proponents since the local government <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> expeditiously resolve any lawsuit that it files against the initiative proponents.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{perception}} that WPA employees were not diligent workers, and that they <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> give up their busy work in favor of productive jobs. Some employers said that the WPA instilled poor work habits and encouraged inefficiency. Some job applicants found that a WPA work history was viewed negatively by employers, who said they had formed poor work habits.|$|R
2500|$|Plurality systems usually {{result in}} single-party {{government}} because relatively few {{votes in the}} most finely balanced districts, the [...] "swing seats", can transfer sufficient seats to the opposition to swing the election. [...] More partisan districts remain invulnerable to swings of political mood. [...] In the UK, for example, about half the constituencies have always elected the same party since 1945; in the 2012 US House elections 45 districts (10% of all districts) were uncontested {{by one of the}} two dominant parties. [...] Voters who know their preferred candidate cannot win <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> vote, and if they do their vote has no effect, it is [...] "wasted".|$|E
2500|$|The goal of {{maritime}} security operations is [...] "actively to deter, disrupt and suppress piracy {{in order to}} protect global {{maritime security}} and secure freedom of navigation for the benefit of all nations", and pirates are often detained, interrogated, disarmed, and released. With millions of dollars at stake, pirates <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> stop. In Finland, one case involved pirates who had been captured and whose boat was sunk. As the pirates attacked a vessel of Singapore, not Finland, and are not themselves EU or Finnish citizens, they were not prosecuted. A further complication in many cases, including this one, is that many countries do not allow extradition of people to jurisdictions where they may be sentenced to death or torture.|$|E
2500|$|Contextual {{factors that}} {{individual}} teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A {{study found that}} increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior. [...] Indeed, increased exam proctoring and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated {{at least once in}} the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught. As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race. [...] Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered. However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or {{at the beginning of a}} test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%. [...] Some professors may <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.|$|E
50|$|Quitting while {{ahead is}} unlikely, though, since a gambler who is winning <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> quit, and is instead {{encouraged}} {{to continue to}} gamble by their winning. Once {{in the throes of}} a winning streak, the individual may even become convinced that it is their skill, rather than chance, causing their winnings, or good luck on their side, and thus it seems especially senseless to stop.|$|R
50|$|The {{railways}} <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> preserve or re-purpose abandoned passenger stations. Municipalities found provincial {{heritage preservation}} laws inadequate to protect railway history as interprovincial rail is within federal jurisdiction. CP's West Toronto station, closed when its last passenger train was rerouted in 1978, was unlawfully demolished on November 25, 1982as one of multiple closed stations demolished in that era, occasionally using similar tactics.|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Ages, most {{lands in}} Savoy, {{as in most}} of Europe, were owned by Feudal lords. Peasants were bound to their lords by heavy duties. The mainmorte system allowed a lord to inherit all the {{property}} of a peasant who died childless. This caused the estates of the lords to grow larger and larger. Both peasants and lords <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> invest in agricultural or industrial improvements.|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{labor costs}} have {{represented}} the largest cost {{component of the}} transportation industry. The industry is heavily unionized, and transport workers generally receive higher wages than the average industrial worker. Under federal economic regulation, carriers <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> bargain hard to keep labor costs low. Restrictive entry policies and collective ratemaking resulted in near-uniform pricing among competitors. Increased labor costs were merely {{passed on to the}} consumers of transport services...|$|R
50|$|Serfdom {{was hardly}} efficient; serfs and nobles <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> improve the land. However, it was {{politically}} effective. Nobles rarely challenged the tsar {{for fear of}} provoking a peasant uprising. Serfs had lifelong tenancy on their plots so they tended to be conservative as well. The serfs took little part in uprisings; it was the Cossacks and nomads who rebelled. The revolutions of 1905 and 1917 happened after serfdom's abolition.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{influence}} of dependency theory, a Marxist approach to international economics, many Latin American countries attempted to industrialize by limiting imports of manufactured goods and subsidizing their own industries. However, {{in the absence of}} competition, and with government subsidies, these companies <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> become efficient or innovative. By the 1980s, the economic problems of these countries became obvious, and much of the West's investment in these countries was lost.|$|R

40|$|In {{the typical}} {{regulatory}} scheme a franchised monopoly <b>has</b> <b>little</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> reduce costs. This article proposes a mechanism {{in which the}} price the regulated firm receives depends on the costs of identical firms. In equilibrium each firm chooses a socially efficient level of cost reduction. The mechanism generalizes to cover heterogeneous firms with observable differences.
