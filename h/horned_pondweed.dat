40|$|The American {{black duck}} (Anas rubripes) is an outcome species {{for the health}} of the Chesapeake Bay. In order to {{estimate}} the impact that changes in black duck habitat will have on the Bayâ€™s wintering population, the relationship between black ducks and the species comprising their diets must be better understood. This study {{was part of a larger}} effort to build a comprehensive bioenergetics model for black ducks wintering in the Chesapeake Bay. Using black ducks as model species, functional response curves were created for five experimental species known to be consumed by black ducks. For each curve, three regressions representing the three types of functional response models were run. In examining the regression fits along with using biological inferences, the functional response types for each experimental species were determined to be type I for softstem bulrush seeds, type II for widgeon grass, <b>horned</b> <b>pondweed,</b> and Eastern mosquitofish, and type III for saltmarsh snails. This research was used to determine critical foraging densities and will contribute to the bioenergetics model that will help identify areas where conservation efforts should be targeted in order to benefit black ducks and contribute to the overall health of the Chesapeake Bay...|$|E
40|$|Lake Fayetteville and Lake Wedington {{are small}} {{reservoirs}} of {{about the same}} size and age that are located in northwestern Arkansas. We collected macrophytes from eleven transects around each reservoir in the autumn of 1993. Justicia (waterwillow), Typha (cat-tail), Scirpus (bulrush), Potamogeton (pondweed), and Zannichellia (<b>horned</b> <b>pondweed)</b> occur in both reservoirs. Justicia occurs most commonly in both reservoirs. The macrophytes of Lake Wedington are organized in a characteristic zonation pattern with bands from shore toward open water of emergent, floating-leaved, then submersed macrophytes. Macrophyte zonation was not as evident in Lake Fayetteville because of the low occurrence of floating leaved and submersed macrophytes in 1993. Early studies of Lake Wedington found that the dominant macrophytes were Cyperus, Echinochloa, Lotus, and Sagittaria, all of which were absent during this study. Potamogeton, Scirpus, and Typha were also found to be dominant during 1952 studies, but occurred in lesser amounts in the current study. Previous studies (1956, 1967, 1977) on Lake Fayetteville stated that Sagittaria and Nelumbo were dominant macrophytes, but we found none in 1993. Juncus, Potamogeton, Scirpus, and Typha were common in the early studies but occurred infrequently in our collections. Macrophyte composition in Lake Fayetteville in 1993 was attributable to an herbicide application that occurred in spring, 1992. As for the changes in Lake Wedington, we assume that the Justicia has out-competed those macrophytes that were in the reservoir in 1952, or that normal lake ontogeny during the intervening 40 years has altered habitat conditions to now favor Justicia...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Kesterson Reservoir (Kesterson) {{received}} subsurface agricultural drainwater containing {{high levels}} of salts and other minerals from farmland in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Aquatic plants and invertebrates were sampled at Kesterson in May, August, and December of 1984. The reservoir supported a different biota and lower species diversity than a nearby control site (Volta WMA). Kesterson had a greater plant and seed biomass while Volta had a greater invertebrate abundance. Submergent habitat at Kesterson was dominated by widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima) while Volta was dominated by <b>horned</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Zannichellia palustris). Several aquatic invertebrates, including Amphipoda, Exlais, Gastropoda, Neomysis, Hirundinea, and Belostomatidae were common at Volta but were never observed at Kesterson. Kesterson supported a greater abundance of diatoms (Nitzschia), Oligochaeta, Ephydridae, Stratiomyidae, Tabanidae, and Syrphidae while these were rarely encountered at Volta. Community structure at Kesterson was most likely influenced by high concentrations of salts, nitrogen, boron, and possibly selenium. Bioaccumulation of selenium and other trace elements in wetlands and waterfowl foods at Kesterson was investigated during May, August, and December of 1984. High concentrations of selenium were found in water, sediments, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, and aquatic insects. Selenium concentrations in aquatic plants and insects ranged from 2 to 310 ppm and were about 10 to 290 times those found at Volta. Concentrations in waterfowl food plants and insects at Kesterson were as high as 64 times greater than those reported to be a health hazard to birds. Seasonal variations in selenium concentrations were observed in some plants, but few consistent seasonal patterns were observed in aquatic insects, and few differences in selenium accumulation were found among ponds. Distribution of selenium in plant parts was not uniform during a growing season, as rhizomes contained higher concentrations than seeds. Most biota bioaccumulated selenium to levels greater than 1000 times the concentration in water, some nearly 5000 times. Mean concentrations of boron in aquatic plants and insects were usually 2 to 52 times those at Volta. Concentrations of other trace elements (i. e. arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, and nickel) at Kesterson were too low to be toxic to biota...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{variation in}} nature is called biodiversity. Anthropogenic pressures {{have led to}} a loss of biodiversity, alarming scientists as to what consequences declining diversity has for ecosystem functioning. The general consensus is that diversity (e. g. species richness or identity) affects functioning and provides services from which humans benefit. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how aquatic plant species richness and identity affect ecosystem functioning in terms of processes such as primary production, nutrient availability, epifaunal colonization and properties e. g. stability of Zostera marina subjected to shading. The main work was carried out in the field and ranged temporally from weeklong to 3. 5 months-long experiments. The experimental plants used frequently co-occur in submerged meadows in the northern Baltic Sea and consist of eelgrass (Z. marina), perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus), sago pondweed (P. pectinatus), slender-leaved pondweed (P. filiformis) and <b>horned</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Zannichellia palustris). The results showed that plant richness affected epifaunal community variables weakly, but had a strong positive effect on infaunal species number and functional diversity, while plant identity had strong effects on amphipods (Gammarus spp.), of which abundances were higher in plant assemblages consisting of P. perfoliatus. Depending on the starting standardizing unit, plant richness showed varying effects on primary production. In shoot density-standardized plots, plant richness increased the shoot densities of three out of four species and enhanced the plant biomass production. Both positive complementarity and selection effects were found to underpin the positive biodiversity effects. In shoot biomass-standardized plots, richness effects only affected biomass production of one species. Negative selection was prevalent, counteracting positive complementarity, which resulted in no significant biodiversity effect. The stability of Z. marina was affected by plant richness in such that Z. marina growing in polycultures lost proportionally less biomass than Z. marina in monocultures and thus had a higher resistance to shading. Monoculture plants in turn gained biomass faster, and thereby had a faster recovery than Z. marina growing in polycultures. These results indicate that positive interspecific interactions occurred during shading, while the faster recovery of monocultures suggests that the change from shading stress to recovery resulted in a shift from positive interactions to resource competition between species. The results derived from this thesis show that plant diversity affects ecosystem functioning and contribute to the growing knowledge of plant diversity being an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Diverse plant communities sustain higher primary productivity than comparable monocultures, affect faunal communities positively and enhance stability. Richness and identity effects vary, and identity has generally stronger effects on more variables than richness. However, species-rich communities are likely to contain several species with differing effects on functions, which renders species richness important for functioning. Mixed meadows add to coastal ecosystem functioning in the northern Baltic Sea and may provide with services essential for human well-being...|$|E
