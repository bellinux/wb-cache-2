50|$|In {{theories}} {{of competition in}} economics, a barrier to entry, or an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to entry, is a cost that must be incurred by a new entrant into a market that incumbents do not have or have not had to incur.|$|E
50|$|A {{primary barrier}} to entry is a cost that {{constitutes}} an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to entry on its own. An ancillary {{barrier to entry}} is a cost that does not constitute a barrier to entry by itself, but reinforces other barriers to entry if they are present.|$|E

5000|$|In the court's opinion, Justice Clark said: [...] "In thus {{erecting}} an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> {{protecting a}} major local industry against competition from without the state, Madison plainly discriminates against interstate commerce. This it cannot do, {{even in the}} exercise of its unquestioned power to protect {{the health and safety of}} the people, if reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives... are available".|$|E
5000|$|An {{antitrust}} {{barrier to}} entry is [...] "a cost that delays entry and thereby reduces social welfare relative to immediate but equally costly entry". This contrasts {{with the concept of}} <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to entry defined above, as it can delay entry into a market but does not result in any cost-advantage to incumbents in the market. All economic barriers to entry are antitrust barriers to entry, but the converse is not true.|$|E
50|$|What is {{ultimate}} is {{the principle}} that one state, in its dealings with another, may not place itself {{in a position of}} economic isolation. Formulas and catchwords are subordinate to this overmastering requirement. Neither the power to tax nor the police power may be used by the state of destination with the aim and effect of establishing an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> against competition with the products of another state or the labor of its residents. Restrictions so contrived are an unreasonable clog upon the mobility of commerce.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, abstentionists {{argue that}} while {{drinking}} {{may have been}} more acceptable in ancient times (for instance, using wine to purify polluted drinking water), modern circumstances have changed the nature of a Christian's responsibility in this area. First, some abstentionists argue that wine in biblical times was weaker and diluted with water such that drunkenness was less common, though few non-abstentionists accept this claim as wholly accurate or conclusive. Also, the invention of more efficient distillation techniques has led to more potent and cheaper alcohol, which in turn has lessened the <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to drinking to excess compared to biblical times.|$|E
5000|$|Capriolo, {{later called}} Aeromere, {{was the name}} of the {{motorcycle}} production arm of the Italian aircraft company Aeromere or Aero-Caproni. After World War II, the victorious Allies prohibited wartime aircraft and other military hardware suppliers from remaining in their previous industries, and Aero-Caproni would change its name to Capriolo and become one of several, including Aermacchi, MV Agusta, Vespa and Ducati, that switched to producing motorcycles or scooters. [...] These companies did well until the mid-1960s, when the advent of affordable cars like the Fiat 500 removed the <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> that kept many Italians relying on motorcycles for basic transportation. [...] Capriolo was typical of those that could not survive the transformation to a more export-oriented industry, with the US as the most important market. [...] Motorcycle production ran from 1947 or 1948 until 1964 when the company was purchased by the Laverda group.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of undocumented children {{are growing up}} with legal access to public education but face legal barriers to higher education (Abrego, 2006). Abrego interviewed a girl named Alisa {{who came to the}} United States at the age of five from Guatemala; she encountered the difficulties of higher education. She was a student who excelled academically in high school and was admitted to the University of California. Alisa became disheartened due to her status and was unable to be given financial aid. Some researchers explain that undocumented children face an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> when pursuing a higher education and find that because of this they are unable to attend a University (Abrego; Shields and Behrman, 2004; Gonzales, 2011; Crosnoe and Turley, 2011). Due to this, The Dream Act was proposed to the Senate and the House of Representatives and was only 13 states that include California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin passed their state laws. These states allow undocumented children to pay in-state tuition based on their attendance and graduation from a state high school (Schmid 2013).|$|E

5000|$|A tariff {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} a {{specific}} good or set of goods exported from or imported to a country, creating an <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to trade. Usually the tactic is used when a country's domestic output of the good is falling and imports from foreign competitors are rising, particularly if there exist strategic reasons for retaining a domestic production capability. Some failing industries receive a protection with an effect similar to a subsidies in that by placing the tariff on the industry, the industry is less enticed to produce goods in a quicker, cheaper, and more productive fashion. The third reason for a tariff involves addressing the issue of dumping. Dumping involves a country producing highly excessive amounts of goods and dumping the goods on another foreign country, producing the effect of prices that are [...] "too low". Too low can refer to either pricing the good from the foreign market at a price lower than charged in the domestic market of the country of origin. The other reference to dumping relates or refers to the producer selling the product at a price {{in which there is}} no profit or a loss. The purpose and expected outcome of the tariff is to encourage spending on domestic goods and services.|$|E
50|$|As {{the city}} slowly began {{filling in the}} Back Bay tidal estuary to {{establish}} the South End and Back Bay sections of the city, the rail line {{went from being a}} lone causeway in the middle of said tidal estuary to a major transportation cut through the heart of the western sections of the city.(See Fig. 2) Besides being a physical separator, the railroad was a societal and <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> as well; while the South End reclamation project was a municipal project that lacked any form of solid planning, the Back Bay reclamation project was a state-run program that established specific ideas of who would reside within the district. The proximity of the railway also led to an unforeseen effect, suburban flight. With the new rail lines in close proximity to the entire city, many wealthier citizens began migrating to the cities and towns west of Boston. This migration put financial burdens for municipal services such as water and sewer, fire and police on these communities, and helped lead to drives for them to be annexed by Boston, further expanding the city limits. Despite these issues, {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century the western railroad and its contemporaries were helping drive the city’s economy by assisting local industries to bring products to Boston’s port, helping it become the second busiest port on the eastern seaboard.|$|E

Our research design compares the cross-border migration of accounting professionals relative to tightly-matched other professionals before and after regulatory harmonization. We find that, on average, labor migration in the accounting profession increases relative to comparable professions by roughly 15 % after harmonization. The findings illustrate that diversity in rules constitutes an important <b>economic</b> <b>barrier</b> to cross-border labor mobility and, more specifically, that accounting harmonization can have a meaningful effect on cross-border migration...|$|E
