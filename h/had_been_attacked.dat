5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

50|$|Cubberley's {{academic}} legacy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> controversial. Since {{his death}} in 1941, Cubberley's impact <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked,</b> most memorably by Lawrence Cremin's The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley (1965). Some academicians have used Cubberley's methodology as a cautionary tale and termed his approach anachronistic and evangelistic, {{and some of his}} administration stances <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> as sexist and autocratic.|$|R
5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an {{enormous}} volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E
5|$|De León later rescued L'Archeveque and his {{companion}} Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers {{had died of}} smallpox, and the others {{had been killed by}} Native Americans. The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|McCudden did not score {{again during}} the year but had a {{remarkable}} escape on 27 December 1916. Flying from Arras to Monchy on patrol, his flight of six DH.2s engaged an enemy formation of Albatros D.IIs. McCudden rushed {{to the aid of}} Alexander James, a member of his flight, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by a German fighter. He attacked the Albatros head-on but his gun jammed after 20 shots. As he fought to clear the jam he found himself amid a number of German fighters.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The E-boats laid up in {{the shelters}} during the day, safe from air–attack, and put to sea under cover of night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, {{with a total of}} 53 of the five–ton, Tallboy earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 15 May U-43 opened fire with her deck gun and {{anti-aircraft}} guns on the 488 ton French three-masted sailing ship Notre Dame du Châtelet, en route from St. Malo to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to fish. After being hit by 45 shells the ship sank. Lüth suspected that the vessel was reporting the positions of U-boats to Allied forces, while the 10 survivors thought they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by a British submarine. They, from her crew of 38, abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Two were picked up by the Italian submarine Otaria on 23 May.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E
5|$|The wing began flying night defence patrols {{shortly after}} No.452 Squadron arrived at Morotai. At the time Morotai {{was a major}} Allied base and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by Japanese {{aircraft}} on multiple occasions. During the night of 24December a Spitfire shot down a Japanese bomber over the island. This proved {{to be one of}} the last Japanese raids on Morotai, however, and no further interceptions were made. The lack of aerial opposition meant that No.80 Wing's aircraft were increasingly used to strafe Japanese positions near Morotai. During January 1945 the wing flew 84 ground attack sorties, losing three Spitfires in the process. The lack of opportunities for aerial combat disappointed No.80 Wing's pilots and contributed to a decline in their morale.|$|E

5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked.</b> After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|While the {{majority}} of the 2/3rd Battalion was successfully evacuated to Egypt, a small force of 141 men were evacuated to the island of Crete instead, after the transport ship they were on was sunk. Having formed the rearguard during the withdrawal from Greece, they had embarked separately from the main body, being taken aboard the Costa Rica. During the voyage to Alexandria, the transport <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by German aircraft, and as it sank, they were ordered to abandon ship. After being rescued by Royal Navy destroyers, the troops were transported to Crete, where they were formed into a composite battalion with men from other units of the 16th Brigade, and together the unit became known as the 16th Brigade Composite Battalion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

5|$|After a brief lull, the {{violence}} continued on May 8. The nativists {{came back to}} Kensington and burned down St. Michael's Catholic Church and rectory at Second and Jefferson Streets, the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> a few days before, and several homes were attacked before soldiers arrived and the fire was contained. While the riot was being contained in Kensington, another nativist mob had gathered within the borders of Philadelphia itself. They gathered at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, located on Fourth Street between Vine and New Streets. City troops were stationed by the church, and Mayor John Morin Scott pleaded for calm. The rioters threw stones at the mayor, ignored the troops and burned down the church, cheering when the steeple fell. A nearby school {{with a collection of}} rare books was also set aflame. The rioters did not attack an unfinished German Catholic church under construction.|$|E
5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there had been too many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked,</b> and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the same}} morning the night harbour {{occupied}} by the New Zealanders from V Company, 2 RAR/NZ <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> by a Viet Cong force consisting of elements of three companies from the 274th Regiment, shortly after stand-to at 06:15. The incident {{proved to be the}} most intense fighting involving New Zealand forces in Vietnam to that point, and over the course of an hour the attack was successfully repelled with the assistance of highly accurate artillery support from the 108th Battery, RAA operating in direct support, as well as from mortar fire. The Viet Cong withdrew following the arrival of a light fire team of gunships, leaving behind 13 dead {{and a number of other}} blood trails. Nine New Zealanders were wounded in the engagement, six of whom subsequently required evacuation by helicopter.|$|E
