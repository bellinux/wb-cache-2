40|$|Layered topological insulators, for example, Bi_ 2 Se_ 3 are {{optically}} hyperbolic {{materials in}} a range of THz frequencies. Such materials possess deeply subdiffractional, highly <b>directional</b> <b>collective</b> modes: hyperbolic phonon-polaritons. In thin crystals the dispersion of such modes is split into discrete subbands and is strongly influenced by electron surface states. If the surface states are doped, then hybrid collective modes result from coupling of the phonon-polaritons with surface plasmons. The strength of the hybridization can be controlled by an external gate that varies the chemical potential of the surface states. Momentum-dependence of the plasmon-phonon coupling leads to a polaritonic analog of the Goos-Hänchen effect. Directionality of the polaritonic rays and their tunable Goos-Hänchen shift are observable via THz nanoimaging. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

Starting with a reduced model for collective motion, we determine how the critical density depends on {{the form of the}} initial perturbation.

40|$|In {{a system}} of noisy {{self-propelled}} particles with interactions that favor <b>directional</b> alignment, <b>collective</b> motion will appear if the density of particles increases beyond a certain threshold. In this paper, we argue that such a threshold may depend also on the profiles of the perturbation in the particle directions. Specifically, we perform mean-field, linear stability, perturbative and numerical analyses on an approximated form of the Fokker-Planck equation describing the system. We find that if an angular perturbation to an initially homogeneous system is large in magnitude and highly localized in space, it will be amplified and thus serves {{as an indication of}} the onset of collective motion. Our results also demonstrate that high particle speed promotes collective motion. Comment: To appear in Physical Review E...|$|R

Furthermore, in the 2 D coupled Brownian motor system there are the collective effect and ratchet behavior, which can switch depending on the frequency of driving force.

40|$|SummaryThe {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} has astonishing regenerative capabilities in that cut nerves are able to reconnect and re-establish their function. Schwann cells are important players in this process, during which they dedifferentiate to a progenitor/stem cell and promote axonal regrowth. Here, we report that fibroblasts also play a key role. Upon nerve cut, ephrin-B/EphB 2 signaling between fibroblasts and Schwann cells results in cell sorting, followed by <b>directional</b> <b>collective</b> cell migration of Schwann cells out of the nerve stumps to guide regrowing axons across the wound. Mechanistically, we find that cell-sorting downstream of EphB 2 is mediated by the stemness factor Sox 2 through N-cadherin relocalization to Schwann cell-cell contacts. In vivo, loss of EphB 2 signaling impaired organized migration of Schwann cells, resulting in misdirected axonal regrowth. Our results identify a link between Ephs and Sox proteins, providing a mechanism by which progenitor cells can translate environmental cues to orchestrate the formation of new tissue.

40|$|AbstractAfter {{induction}} and specification in the ectoderm, at {{the border}} of the neural plate, the neural crest (NC) population leaves its original territory through a delamination process. Soon afterwards, the NC cells migrate throughout the embryo and colonize a myriad of tissues and organs where they settle and differentiate. The delamination involves a partial or complete epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) regulated by a complex network of transcription factors including several proto-oncogenes. Studying the relationship between these genes at the time of emigration, and their individual or collective impact on cell behavior, provides valuable information about their role in EMT in other contexts such as cancer metastasis. During migration, NC cells are exposed to large number of positive and negative regulators that control where they go by generating permissive and restricted areas and by modulating their motility and directionality. In addition, as most NC cells migrate collectively, cell–cell interactions {{play a crucial role in}} polarizing the cells and interpreting external cues. Cell cooperation eventually generates an overall polarity to the population, leading to <b>directional</b> <b>collective</b> cell migration. This review will summarize our current knowledge on delamination, EMT and migration of NC cells using key examples from chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish and mouse embryos. Given the similarities between neural crest migration and cancer invasion, these cells may represent a useful model for understanding the mechanisms of metastasis...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterium that survives in many environments, including as {{an acute}} and chronic pathogen in humans. Substantial {{evidence shows that}} P. aeruginosa behavior is affected by its motility, and appendages known as flagella and type IV pili (TFP) are known to confer such motility. The role these appendages play when not facilitating motility or attachment, however, is unclear. Here we discern a passive intercellular role of TFP during flagellar-mediated swarming of P. aeruginosa that does not require TFP extension or retraction. We studied swarming at the cellular level {{using a combination of}} laboratory experiments and computational simulations to explain the resultant patterns of cells imaged from in vitro swarms. Namely, we used a computational model to simulate swarming and to probe for individual cell behavior that cannot currently be otherwise measured. Our simulations showed that TFP of swarming P. aeruginosa should be distributed all over the cell and that TFP−TFP interactions between cells should be a dominant mechanism that promotes cell−cell interaction, limits lone cell movement, and slows swarm expansion. This predicted physical mechanism involving TFP was confirmed in vitro using pairwise mixtures of strains with and without TFP where cells without TFP separate from cells with TFP. While TFP slow swarm expansion, we show in vitro that TFP help alter collective motion to avoid toxic compounds such as the antibiotic carbenicillin. Thus, TFP physically affect P. aeruginosa swarming by actively promoting cell-cell association and <b>directional</b> <b>collective</b> motion within motile groups to aid their survival.

40|$|Collective {{migration}} {{depends on}} cell-cell interactions between neighbors {{that contribute to}} their overall directionality, yet the mechanisms that control the coordinated migration of neurons remains to be elucidated. During hindbrain development, facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) undergo a stereotypic tangential caudal migration from their place of birth in rhombomere (r) 4 to their final location in r 6 / 7. FBMNs engage in collective cell migration that depends on neuron-to-neuron interactions to facilitate caudal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that Cadherin- 2 -mediated neuron-to-neuron adhesion is necessary for <b>directional</b> and <b>collective</b> migration of FBMNs. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish expressing dominant-negative Cadherin- 2 (Cdh 2 ΔEC) driven by the islet 1 promoter. Cell-autonomous inactivation of Cadherin- 2 function led to non-directional migration of FBMNs and a defect in caudal tangential migration. Additionally, mosaic analysis revealed that Cdh 2 ΔEC-expressing FBMNs are not influenced to migrate caudally by neighboring wild-type FBMNs due to a defect in collective cell migration. Taken together, our data suggest that Cadherin- 2 plays an essential cell-autonomous role in mediating the collective migration of FBMNs...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} time-resolved pulsed four-wave mixing (FWM) signals in a thermal Rubidium vapor {{involving}} a Rydberg state. We observe FWM signals with dephasing times up to 7 ns, strongly {{dependent on the}} excitation bandwidth to the Rydberg state. The excitation to the Rydberg state is driven by a pulsed two-photon transition on ns time scales. Combined with a third cw de-excitation laser, a strongly <b>directional</b> and <b>collective</b> emission is generated according {{to a combination of}} the phase matching effect and averaging over Doppler classes. In contrast to a previous report [1] using off-resonant FWM, at a resonant FWM scheme we observe additional revivals of the signal shortly after the incident pulse has ended. We infer that this is a revival of motion-induced constructive interference between the coherent emissions of the thermal atoms. The resonant FWM scheme reveals a richer temporal structure of the signals, compared to similar, but off-resonant excitation schemes. A simple explanation lies in the selectivity of Doppler classes. Our numerical simulations based on a four-level model including a whole Doppler ensemble can qualitatively describe the data. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Collective cell {{migration}} {{is an essential}} feature both in embryonic development and cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms of these coordinated directional cell movements {{still need to be}} elucidated. The migration of cranial neural crest (CNC) cells during embryogenesis is an excellent model for collective {{cell migration}} in vivo. These highly motile and multipotent cells migrate directionally on defined routes throughout the embryo. Interestingly, local cell-cell interactions seem to be the key force for directionality. CNC cells can change their migration direction by a repulsive cell response called contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). Cell protrusions collapse upon homotypic cell-cell contact and internal repolarization leads to formation of new protrusions toward cell-free regions. Wnt/PCP signaling was shown to mediate activation of small RhoGTPase RhoA and inhibition of cell protrusions at the contact side. However, the mechanism how a cell recognizes the contact is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Xenopus cadherin- 11 (Xcad- 11) mediated cell-cell adhesion is necessary in CIL for <b>directional</b> and <b>collective</b> migration of CNC cells. Reduction of Xcad- 11 adhesive function resulted in higher invasiveness of CNC due to loss of CIL. Additionally, transplantation analyses revealed that CNC migratory behaviour in vivo is non-directional and incomplete when Xcad- 11 adhesive function is impaired. Blocking Wnt/PCP signaling led to similar results underlining the importance of Xcad- 11 in the mechanism of CIL and directional migration of CNC...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} of individual cells and collective groups of cells has been repeatedly {{shown to be}} an important cellular behavior throughout normal biology and disease progression. Although a significant amount of research has been conducted to understand how an individual cell achieves migration, relatively little is known about how groups of cells coordinate their efforts to migrate collectively. Several protein cytokines, including Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ), have been identified that can be globally administered to cells in vitro, but yield highly <b>directional</b> <b>collective</b> cell migration. In this thesis, I detail my efforts in elucidating how TGFβ stimulation of the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, results in directional and collective cell migration. I developed an in vitro assay and computational analysis program, named Pathfinder, to accurately quantify the angular movements of individual cells in time-lapse microscopy videos. This innovative approach allowed me to measure the degree to which individual cells turn as they migrate {{and the degree to which}} neighboring cells adopt the same migration direction. Using my newly developed tools to measure cellular migration, I found that TGFβ stimulation of HaCaT cells indirectly activates MEK 1 kinase activity, which is modulated by ligand induced cellular spreading. The resulting MEK 1 kinase activity is required and sufficient to elicit collective cell migration in a group of physically interacting cells. I also showed that such collective cell migration is likely the result of the ability of MEK 1 kinase activity to suppress turning behavior in individual cells, which contributes to the spontaneous induction of collective migration behavior in a group of cells. My findings contribute to the TGFβ field by providing an explanation for how MEK 1 kinase can be activated by TGFβ receptor activation. In addition, my findings contribute to the collective cell migration field by detailing the important role of MEK 1 activity in cellular steering, and providing an improved simple model for how collective migration can arise spontaneously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Development of the {{posterior}} lateral line (PLL) system in zebrafish involves cell migration, proliferation and differentiation of mechanosensory cells. The PLL forms when cranial placodal cells delaminate {{and become a}} coherent, migratory primordium that traverses {{the length of the}} fish to form this sensory system. As it migrates, the primordium deposits groups of cells called neuromasts, the specialized organs that contain the mechanosensory hair cells. Therefore the primordium provides both a model for studying <b>collective</b> <b>directional</b> cell migration and the differentiation of sensory cells from multipotent progenitor cells. Results Through the combined use of transgenic fish, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting and microarray analysis we identified a repertoire of key genes expressed in the migrating primordium and in differentiated neuromasts. We validated the specific expression in the primordium of a subset of the identified sequences by quantitative RT-PCR, and by in situ hybridization. We also show that interfering with the function of two genes, f 11 r and cd 9 b, defects in primordium migration are induced. Finally, pathway construction revealed functional relationships among the genes enriched in the migrating cell population. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that this is a robust approach to globally analyze tissue-specific expression and we predict that many of the genes identified in this study will show critical functions in developmental events involving collective cell migration and possibly in pathological situations such as tumor metastasis. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{impressive}} features of moving animal groups is their ability to perform sudden coherent changes in travel direction. While this collective decision can be a response to an external perturbation, such as the presence of a predator, recent studies show that such directional switching can also emerge from the intrinsic fluctuations in the individual behaviour. However, the cause and the mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not fully understood yet. Here, we present an experimental study of spontaneous collective turns in natural flocks of starlings. We employ a recently developed tracking algorithm to reconstruct three-dimensional trajectories of each individual bird in the flock for the whole duration of a turning event. Our approach enables us to analyze changes in the individual behavior of every group member and reveal the emergent dynamics of turning. We show that spontaneous turns start from individuals located at the elongated edges of the flocks, and then propagate through the group. We find that birds on the edges deviate from the mean direction of motion much more frequently than other individuals, indicating that persistent localized fluctuations are the crucial ingredient for triggering a <b>collective</b> <b>directional</b> change. Finally, we quantitatively show that birds follow equal radius paths during turning allowing the flock to change orientation and redistribute risky locations among group members. The whole process of turning is a remarkable example of how a self-organized system can sustain collective changes and reorganize, while retaining coherence. Comment: 18 pages, 2 Videos adde...|$|R
