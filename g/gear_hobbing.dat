50|$|Hobbing machines, {{also known}} as hobbers, are fully {{automated}} machines that come in many sizes, because {{they need to be}} able to produce anything from tiny instrument gears up to 10 ft diameter marine gears.

50|$|The {{starter ring}} gear is most {{commonly}} made by forming a length of square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the starter ring need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at pitch circle diameter is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a flexplate.|$|E
50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the gear blank was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and gear blank revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the <b>gear.</b> <b>Hobbing</b> has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears.|$|E

Abstract: {{numerical control}} system {{is used to}} control the <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> and <b>gear</b> blank in autorotation and linkage generative movement, to realize the machining of teeth shape and teeth dividing; {{and at the same}} time it controls the vertical displacement of the <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> and the horizontal displacement of gear blank, to make a circular arc track whose radius is the sum of gear blank’s radius and <b>gear</b> <b>hob’s</b> radius, thus realizing the NC machining of circular-arc aligned gear. Before and after the machining of teeth form, transition arc is used to finish the trimming and thinning of the teeth thickness at the teeth end; on the prerequisite of machining the circular-arc aligned gear, this method successfully solves the puzzle of gear chamfering, and discharges all gear burr into the lower end of the teeth. The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the teeth thickness. So, the machining precision of the parts is prior to the requirements in the drawing, and this method yields good effect, which broadens the application of NC technology...|$|R

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a clearance groove cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E

Their <b>Gear</b> <b>Hobbing</b> Machine came out in two sizes in 1910 and could precisely cut teeth in gears. In 1919, the company purchased {{the rights to the}} Warp Drawing Machine from the American Warp Drawing Machine Company. This machine eased the transition of switching warping patterns. In 1921, Barber-Colman introduced a High Speed Warper & Creel and Automatic Spoolers. By 1931, the company also had production facilities in Framingham, Massachusetts; Greenville, South Carolina; Munich, Germany; Chicago; Cincinnati, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and Manchester, England.Howard Colman died in a car accident in 1942. Harry Severson, one of the three original directors, took over leadership of the company. In 1953, the [...] "Park Plant" [...] was built, a one-story, 125000 sq ft building in nearby Loves Park. In 1954, the company purchased the Hendey Machine Company. By 1965, three other additions were complete on the Loves Park facility. In 1968, a 200000 sq ft facility was built just north of the original plant. By 1975, Barber-Colman employed 4000 workers among its 150 locations. The company was family-owned until the death of Walter Colman (Howard's son) in 1983. Following Colman's death, the company was sold off to various companies. Reed-Chatwood purchased the textile operations and continued to manufacture from the original factory until 2001. The machine tool division was sold to fellow Rockford company Bourn & Koch, Inc. Bourn & Koch provides parts, service and support for their machines to this day. Barber-Colman henceforth focused on cutting tools and process controls. The remaining divisions were eventually sold off. The Barber-Colman trademark is held by Eurotherm Controls, Inc. The historic complex has been vacated since Reed-Chatwood relocated in 2001. The City of Rockford currently owns the property, purchasing it for $750,000 in 2002. On August 8, 2006, it was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

One way towards the industrial pursuit of more competitive and sustainable manufacturing {{is to reduce}} the number of processes, while retaining functionality and quality.

40|$|Invalid {{measurement}} {{data are}} phenomena that plague {{the reliability of}} Coordinate Measurement Systems. The best-fit algorithms used for feature computation all amplify {{the influence of the}} points most distant from the mean. As a result, a single invalid point can significantly skew the computed feature parameters, even for large data sets. If the feature happens to be a datum, the error propagates through the measurement of the entire part. A measurement consisting of thousands of measured points can be ruined by a single bad piece of data. It is therefore desirable that invalid data be identified and removed before feature evaluation is performed. Three separate cases are considered. The first case is the problem of contact occurring on undesired surfaces. This type of problem can occur when measuring complex parts such as a <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> or when using a non-spherical probe. This case is the best suited for solution through the use of surface normal data since the change in surface normal between surfaces is large and easily detected. The remaining problem, the detection of invalid data due to dirt, burrs, porosity or external factors, is divided into 2 cases. The division is made based upon the spacing of the data collected. If the spacing is large, each point can only be considered independently. If the measurement data are dense we can use the relationship between points to refine the analysis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} chain for gear manufacturing, <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> {{is one of}} the most {{productive}} processes for soft machining of gears. To reach a high quality after the soft machining, for example in gear finish hobbing, the requirements on the hobbing process increases significantly. To get a high quality part after soft machining, the process of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> is mostly divided in a roughing and a finishing cut. In the roughing process, the most amount of the material needs to get machined. The finishing process is used to get a high quality shape of the gear and to get low surface roughness. To get low cutting forces in the finishing step, the material stock after the roughing process has to be minimized. A low amount of stock on the flank offers the possibility to use high cutting speeds. This paper deals with the investigation of the two cut processes in the <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Especially, the tool life of different tool concepts are taken into account. The process design offers the opportunity to use the same tool for the roughing and the finishing cut or the choice of different tools. Using different tools, a special tool design for the finishing step would be possible. A comparison between these two concepts is the focus of the investigation...|$|E

Furthermore, the theoretical analysis was done by considering both the separation of teeth and the mesh with back faces which was not usually used. The main results were as follows. Applying transmitted tooth load variation, the degrees of the separation of teeth and the meshing with the back faces increased, and the fillet stress of the light-loaded gear increased.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|E
