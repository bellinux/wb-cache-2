5|$|The {{discovery}} {{made headlines}} around the globe. Lowell Observatory, {{which had the}} right to name the new object, received more than 1,000 suggestions from all over the world, ranging from Atlas to Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone <b>else</b> <b>did.</b> Constance Lowell proposed Zeus, then Percival and finally Constance. These suggestions were disregarded.|$|E
5|$|Blue Bombers {{management}} {{decided that}} they needed a new coach prior to the 1957 season. On January 30, 1957, Grant accepted the Blue Bombers head coaching position after impressing management with his ability to make adjustments on offense and defense as a player. Club president, J.T. Russell, thought that Grant could coach even though nobody <b>else</b> <b>did.</b> Grant would remain the {{head coach of the}} Blue Bombers until 1966. At age 29 (he would be 30 by the time he coached his first game), Grant became the youngest head coach in CFL history.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone <b>else</b> <b>did.</b> We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

25|$|Edison {{devised a}} circuit where his {{modified}} light bulb effectively replaced the resistor in a DC voltmeter. Edison {{was awarded a}} patent for this invention in 1884. Since there was no apparent practical use for such a device at the time, the patent application was most likely simply a precaution in case someone <b>else</b> <b>did</b> find a use for the so-called Edison effect.|$|E
25|$|In the 1928 letter, he recounted what {{happened}} during those early attempts: “At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty miles an hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside directly after it left the ground. So I never flew with my first experimental plane, but no-one <b>else</b> <b>did</b> with their first for that matter”.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{the couple}} {{came back to}} the city to work. By then, Bob Whitehead had become a good friend and {{encouraged}} Allen to write another play. She drew on her married life and wrote The First Wife, about a suburban working couple. It was made into the film Wives and Lovers in 1963, starring Janet Leigh and Van Johnson. When Allen read The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, by Muriel Spark, she instantly saw play potential where no one <b>else</b> <b>did.</b> After undergoing hypnotherapy to alleviate a yearlong bout of writer's block, Allen produced a draft of the play in three days.|$|E

25|$|In 1935, {{though he}} had such poor support that Northamptonshire only twice reached 300 in an innings and in one game against Worcestershire he scored 141 out of 199 before being ninth out, Bakewell {{improved}} considerably upon his 1934 form and played with considerable success in two Tests against South Africa. Northamptonshire's dependence upon him was starkly seen in that he averaged 42 an innings and nobody <b>else</b> <b>did</b> better than 23. The following year he was not as consistent, {{but in the last}} match he played a magnificent unbeaten innings of 241 against the strong bowling of Derbyshire - who had sealed their only ever County Championship title - to almost give Northamptonshire an elusive victory.|$|E
25|$|In the {{penultimate}} First Class {{match of}} the tour Freddie Brown was still recovering from his car crash during the Fourth Test, and John Warr, Alec Bedser and Doug Wright were given a rest and Denis Compton had only Trevor Bailey (1/74), nursing his freshly healed broken finger, the young Brian Statham (1/47) and the out of form Brian Close (3/103), Eric Hollies (3/107) and Bob Berry (2/92). Lindsay Hassett took full advantage by making 232 after winning the toss – his highest First Class century – but no one <b>else</b> <b>did</b> except Doug Ring who made 74 as they added 166 for the seventh wicket. Hassett batted well into the second day finishing his century, which pretty much condemned the match to a draw on such a good wicket. The MCC made 414 thanks to Len Hutton (128) and Bailey (125) as Jack Iverson was recovering from a damaged ankle and the only bowlers of quality were Bill Johnston (2/68), Doug Ring (5/134) and Ian Johnson (1/10), the last bowling the out of form Compton with a full toss for 20. Colin MacDonald (26) and Neil Harvey (56) made an opening stand of 56 as the South Australians batted out the game with an innings of 234, leaving the MCC 15 minutes to make 36/1.|$|E
25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody <b>else</b> <b>did</b> {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by the focus group, Maria persuaded Sean {{to go with it}} anyway, as she thought that it was better to have a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Modernism (or the International style) {{was taken up}} by Scandinavian architects. In Scandinavia this {{architectural}} trend was called Functionalism (or colloquially in Sweden and Norway [...] "funkis"). Modernism found many adherents among young architects, especially in Norway. Its definite breakthrough was the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930, after which the majority of architects all over Scandinavia converted to the modern movement. Nowhere <b>else</b> <b>did</b> Modernism become so firmly established as the mainstream trend in architecture. It maintained its dominant position until about 1940.|$|E

He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary.

500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone <b>else</b> <b>did</b> in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E

500|$|On 16 December 1784, St. James's Chronicle stated Hawkins and Boswell {{were both}} writing biographies.

Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the Physical Review in a series of papers over three years.
