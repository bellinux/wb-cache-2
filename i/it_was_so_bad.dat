25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even says that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would shoot {{up from the}} table in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|When Kyril Bonfiglioli {{took over}} in 1964, he complained in his first {{editorial}} that he had [...] "just read through {{a quarter of a}} million words of ms [...] and half of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> it made me blush". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, [...] "written before I got the hang of things", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, [...] "They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted". Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, [...] "Jael Cracken" [...] and [...] "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' first two stories: [...] "Escapism", a time travel tale, and [...] "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as [...] "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers. The Day of the Minotaur, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title The Blue Monkeys. Swann's novel The Weirwoods was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe Science Fantasy under Bonfiglioli's editorship as [...] "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".|$|E

40|$|Most {{of us have}} an {{intuitive}} idea of what secularization is and are probably more or less convinced that we know it when we see <b>it.</b> And chances <b>are</b> that, for many of us, the image that lodges in our minds causes us to view it with some alarm. To borrow {{a line from the}} old Johnny Carson Show routine, “How bad <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> ” Here <b>are</b> a few possible responses. (The figures have been obtained from a data set furnished by the MicroCase Corporation. See Barkan, 1998.) * <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that, whereas in 1978 only a third of Americans approved of legal abortion for any reason by 1996 this figure had climbed to forty–five percent. * <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that the percentage of people saying that premarital sex is NOT wrong rose from 27 % in 1972 to 43 % in 1996 (the last year for which figures <b>were</b> available). * <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that the percentage of Americans saying that homosexual sex is ALWAYS WRONG declined from 75 % in 1990 to just 60 % in 1996. * In fact <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that when my pastor referred to the “S ” word last Sunday, I didn't know whether he was talking about secularization or––that other “S ” word. But the trends that many of us are worried about are not exclusively concerned with sex. Fo...|$|R
5000|$|The {{drafting}} of this Act <b>is</b> [...] "deficient". <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that <b>it</b> might well violate Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Act is [...] "deplorably vague".|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received very mixed reviews, {{with the}} artificial intelligence universally derided and other gameplay elements garnering {{a range of}} opinions. Bozon said that [...] "the A.I. {{can be a real}} pain, as characters often take extremely odd routes to destinations or show command issues when engaging enemies", Joe Juba of Game Informer called the pathfinding [...] "laughably terrible", a criticism echoed by Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com, and Parkin called it [...] "an unmitigated disaster". VanOrd termed it [...] "the worst, most broken system of unit pathfinding ever devised", and Gann felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that it showed that the developers [...] "had no idea what they were doing" [...] in making an RTS. Bozon felt that the overall real-time strategy gameplay, however, was deep, if a bit slow, as did VanOrd. Parkin felt that the gameplay was [...] "easy and intuitive", though slow, while Parish felt that the limitations of the Nintendo DS's small screens made the game too streamlined for an RTS game. Juba and the GamePro reviewer felt that the restrictions necessary to fit an RTS on a system the size of the DS made the game too simple and easy. The Japanese Famitsu review, however, felt that the game worked well as an RTS for the Nintendo DS, and was well-suited to the console. Both Bozon and Parish felt that the local multiplayer was better than the single-player game, though Bozon felt that the lack of online multiplayer was stifling and VanOrd felt that the tie between the multiplayer game and the player's single-player progress imbalanced any game where both players had not fully completed the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Report of a sad case {{recently}} {{tried before}} the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley. Lord Mayor asks whether either side {{is known to}} the police: Policeman X— Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say {{that the old man}} never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't {{think it will be a}} harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street. (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.) ...|$|E

The rulebook includes a bizarrely complex character-creation system, painfully cumbersome combat rules and monster descriptions (with names like 'makl,' 'foklom,' 'finikor,' and 'rolmtrokl')".

The early history of which he spoke was altogether Bible history, and the fallacies to which he alluded were the plainest statements of the book of Genesis.

Ah!

The seven horses still stood in the stable, and although they were stiff from want of exercise, had been hay-fed and watered. On these they proposed to ride, but first they must tell the truth to those who had stood by them. So about three o'clock of the afternoon Christopher called all the men together beneath the gateway and sorrowfully set out his tale. Here, he showed them, they could bide no longer, and to surrender meant that his new-wed wife would soon be made a widow. Therefore they must fly, taking with them as many as there were horses for them to ride, if they cared to risk such a journey. If not, he and the two women would go alone.|$|E
