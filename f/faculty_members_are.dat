25|$|St. John's avoids modern textbooks, lectures, and examinations, {{in favor}} of a series of manuals.

However, at St. John's this varies by course and instructor. Class size is small on both campuses, with a student to tutor ratio of 8:1. Seminar is the largest class, with around 20 students, but led by two tutors. Daytime tutorials are smaller, typically ranging between 12 and 16 students and are led by one tutor.

DRC researchers have carried out systematic studies on a broad range of disaster types, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hazardous chemical incidents, and plane crashes. DRC has also done research on civil disturbances and riots, including the 1992 Los Angeles unrest. Staff have conducted nearly 700 field studies since the Center's inception, traveling to communities throughout the United States and internationally, including Mexico, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Turkey.

[...] Founded under the auspices of the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America, ENC was one of the first three schools officially chosen to be Nazarene institution in 1915, making it the oldest continuously operating educational institution affiliated with the Nazarenes. As one of eight Nazarene liberal arts colleges in the United States, the college receives financial backing equivalent to a $40 million endowment from its constituent churches. Eastern Nazarene is also bound by a gentlemen's agreement not to actively recruit outside its respective educational region, which extends southwest from Maine as far as Pennsylvania and Virginia in the United States and provides trustees for the college. The institution is otherwise largely independent, having been multi-denominational since 1902, and tuition-driven, with an actual endowment of only US $11,015,937. The president and trustees of the college determined in 1931, one year after gaining its charter to grant degrees in Massachusetts, that it is part of the college's mission to be [...] "distinctly interdenominational and cosmopolitan in service."
