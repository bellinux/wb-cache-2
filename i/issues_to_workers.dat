40|$|Although Guanxi, {{political}} climate, {{and power}} are common business {{practices in the}} workplace, the popularity in research {{has yet to be}} intensified. This study aims to explore the effects of Guanxi, political climate, and power bases and the moderating effects of political climate. Questionnaires were <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> across service and manufacturing industries and 1099 valid responses were collected. The results from hierarchical regression analyses indicated significant relationships between Guanxi and power bases in various patterns. Significant relationships also emerged between political climate and power bases. Partial mediating effects of political climate were found between the relationships of Guanxi and power bases. Recommendations, suggestions, and conclusions were also presented {{on the basis of the}} empirical findings...|$|R

5000|$|Coal scrip is [...] "tokens {{or paper}} with a {{monetary}} value <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> as an advance on wages by the coal company or its designated representative". As such, coal scrip could only be used at the specific locality or coal town of the company named. Because coal scrip {{was used in the}} context of a coal town, where there are usually no other retail establishments in that specific remote location, employees who used this could only redeem their value at that specific location. As there were no other retail establishments, this constituted a monopoly. The country musician Merle Travis makes a reference to coal scrip in the song, [...] "Sixteen Tons" [...] on the Folk Songs of the Hills album.|$|R

Under those plans it was estimated {{that by the end of}} 2014-15 about 90% of all foreign nationals would have been issued with one. On 22 January 2008, the Home Office confirmed that large volumes of cards would not be issued until 2012; however, ID cards were <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> in critical locations, starting with airside workers in Manchester and London City airports in 2009, and young people were being offered cards in 2010.|$|R

50|$|The {{documents}} {{describe a}} non-destructive method {{of determining the}} remaining service life of used and new gas cartridges. Polluted air was pumped through the cartridge. The degree of purification of air {{depends on how much}} unsaturated sorbent is in the cartridge. Therefore, accurate measurement of gas concentration in the cleaned air allows one to estimate the amount of the unsaturated sorbent. Polluted air (1-bromobutane) was pumped for a very short time, and therefore, such tests do not reduce the service life considerably. The sorption capacity decreased due to absorption of this gas by the amount of about 0.5% of the sorption capacity of a new cartridge. The method was also used for 100% quality control of cartridges, manufactured by the English firm Martindale Protection Co (10 microliters 1-bromobutane injected into the air stream), and to check the cartridges <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> in firms Waring Ltd and Rentokil Ltd. This method was used in the Chemical Defence Establishment in the early 1970s. The experts who developed this method, received a patent.|$|R

25|$|On September 21, 2007, Spitzer {{issued an}} {{executive}} order directing that state offices allow illegal immigrants <b>to</b> be <b>issued</b> driver's licenses effective December 2007.

After meeting with the Department of Homeland Security in October 2007, Spitzer altered the plan so that licenses <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> migrant <b>workers</b> would look different from other licenses and that the new licenses would not allow access to airplanes and federal buildings.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{obstacles}} hindering {{the development of}} crowdshipping systems: the legal <b>issue</b> related <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> {{is one of the}} most relevant. It is worth noting that remuneration can play a fundamental role. In fact, a very low compensation (even not monetary, such as a public transport ticket), as in the green crowdshipping system investigated, can push people to provide the delivery service without “being workers”. Moreover, since e-commerce is increasing and crowdshipping is not intended to replace traditional logistics providers (rather, it is a complementary system), potential social implications on wages and labor force employed are less critical.|$|R
50|$|While {{praised by}} such {{luminaries}} at Kawabata Yasunari for drawing on modernist literary techniques, Sata became increasing involved in <b>issues</b> related <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> {{and the labor}} movement. In 1929, she spoke out against the treatment of women workers in cigarette factories. In 1931, she defended the striking workers of the Tokyo Muslin Factory. As {{a member of the}} Proletarian Literature Movement, she wrote a series of short stories about the lives of ordinary working men and women. These included Kyoseikikoku (Compulsory Extradition), about the rights of migrant Korean workers and Kambu joko no namida (Tears of a Forewoman).|$|R
5000|$|Trade unions were {{illegal in}} Britain until 1825. Their legal {{standing}} in Upper Canada is uncertain. However, as the Owenite socialist movement in England and America gathered steam in 1834 they created Grand Trade Unions bringing tradesmen of many professions in one union in both continents. A similar movement {{took place in}} Upper Canada. A builders union emerged in 1834, followed by a typographers union shortly thereafter. By 1836, the tradesmen (called [...] "mechanics" [...] then) formed a petitioning organization, the [...] "Mechanics Association," [...] {{in order to further}} the political <b>issues</b> important <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> - the use of prison labour in particular.|$|R

5|$|Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, then {{located in}} Zagreb, {{along with the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, sent a {{delegation}} to 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar urging them <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> arms <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> <b>to</b> help defend Zagreb. Pavle Gregorić, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'état government of Dušan Simović, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, but they did not respond to his appeal.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} days, Deanston Mill {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland and developed a number of nationally important innovations which continue to impact the distillery today. Due to a shortage of currency at the time, Deanston was the first major industrial works to produce its own currency. The French Revolution and Napoleonic War meant that silver and gold were drained away to pay for hostilities and as a result, Deanston Mill countermarked Spanish and French coins and <b>issued</b> them <b>to</b> <b>workers</b> and suppliers as pay. Very few of these coins still exist, however one is currently on display at the distillery.|$|R

50|$|In 1938, the Germans {{developed}} {{a variant of}} the Stahlhelm with a wider, flared peak and ventilation holes originally intended for firefighters, civil defense, Reichsarbeitsdienst, and Luftschutz personnel. Known as the gladiator pattern, the privately purchased Luftschutz helmet was originally made from three pieces of steel and typically painted black or dark blue. Later in the war these were <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> Volkssturm personnel, and sometimes repainted in Feldgrun. By 1944, the helmets were stamped from a single steel sheet, and the original cloth lining replaced with vinyl to reduce costs. Due to the relatively small number produced, original helmets from the war years are considered rare. However, a modified postwar version in fluorescent green, white or yellow continued <b>to</b> be <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> rescue <b>workers</b> in the Bundesrepublik until the early 1990s.|$|R

Train drivers operating {{in these areas}} were asked their opinion as {{to the effectiveness of}} the jackets. Following trials, high-visibility clothing was <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> engineering and other staff working on the electrified lines of BR's London Midland Region in 1965.

50|$|Though {{movements}} to reduce CSE have been successful, CSE still poses an <b>issue</b> <b>to</b> many <b>workers</b> {{that are at}} occupational risk. Statistics published in 2012 by Nicole Cherry et al. claim that at least 20% of employees in Finland still encounter organic solvents at the workplace, and 10% of them experience some form of disadvantage from the exposure. In Norway, 11% of the male population of workers and 7% of female workers are still exposed to solvents daily and as of 2006, the country has {{the highest rate of}} diagnosed CSE in Europe. Furthermore, due to the complexity of screening for CSE, there is still a high likelihood of a population of undiagnosed cases.|$|R
