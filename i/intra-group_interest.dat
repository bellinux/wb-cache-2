40|$|Interest {{payments}} between {{affiliated companies}} which aim at shifting profit from high to low tax countries are a well-known and frequently used tool in international tax planning. It {{is therefore not}} surprising that in the OECD Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) (Action Plan) considerable attention {{is given to the}} measures limiting the deductibility of (excessive) <b>intra-group</b> <b>interest</b> payments. 1 The Action Plan does not, however, provide any clear guidance as to which, among the domestic anti-abuse measures existing in OECD or non-OECD member countries, should be recommended. Moreover, the OECD, by sticking to the arm’s length standard, refuses to consider more radical corporate tax reforms that could put an end to tax arbitrage opportunities created by cross-borders <b>intra-group</b> <b>interest</b> payments. From the EU perspective one may observe some interesting convergences between the OECD initiatives and the new measures that are presently being discussed in the European Commission and the Counci...|$|E
40|$|In July 2009, the European Commission {{decided that}} the Dutch group {{interest}} box measure - a special beneficial tax regime for the taxation of <b>intra-group</b> <b>interest</b> - did not constitute State aid under EU law. This article critically analyses the Commission’s decision and arrives at the opposite conclusion, that is, the measure grants selective advantage to group companies and specifically to multinational groups of companies. In {{the course of the}} analysis of the decision, a general analytical framework is proposed for examining fiscal measures suspect of being State aid. The question what options remain for the Member States after the decision to introduce tax measures attractive for multinational enterprises is discussed. Finally, the interest box measure is also examined {{in the light of the}} Code of Conduct criteria for harmful tax measures...|$|E
40|$|Long ago, historians {{more or less}} gave up on 2 ̆ 2 {{theories}} of history. 2 ̆ 2 They determined that human nature was too unpredictable, cultures too various, and developmental patterns too evanescent for any really scientific theory of history to be possible. Human history, they said, was chaos. The problem is that human history isn 2 ̆ 7 t chaos at all. The 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2 human sciences—evolutionary biology and anthropology in particular—have shown that human nature is quite predictable, cultural variability is strictly constrained, and ongoing patterns of social development have ancient roots. Historians can ignore these facts all they like, but that doesn 2 ̆ 7 t make them any the less true. It does, however, impoverish their discipline by ceding {{the search for a}} satisfying theory of history to scientists. Neither Paul Bingham nor Joanne Souza are historians. The former is a molecular biologist and the latter an evolutionary psychologist. But they have formulated an elegant theory of human history in Death From a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe (2009). Like any good theory, it explains a lot with a little. To put it briefly, human society has gone from simple/small to massive/complex because humans alone among animals were/are able to suppress <b>intra-group</b> conflicts of <b>interest</b> by means of low-cost coercion. Bingham and Souza point out that the big 2 ̆ 2 jumps 2 ̆ 2 in social size and complexity—the neolithic revolution, the growth of archaic states, the birth of the nation-state, the rise of globalization—have all been associated with the evolution/introduction of new, more powerful coercive abilities. Paradoxically, it was new weapons that created more and better lives {{over the course of the}} last several hundred thousand years. This brief summary cannot do justice to the richness of Bingham 2 ̆ 7 s and Souza 2 ̆ 7 s theory. You need to read it for yourself. When you do, I guarantee you will see the past and present in a new way...|$|R
