In South America and Africa, <b>juvenile</b> white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|As {{for other}} lambeosaurines, it is {{believed}} that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the <b>juvenile</b> form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one <b>juvenile</b> braincase, and one recently discovered <b>juvenile</b> skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, <b>juvenile</b> Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a <b>juvenile</b> braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of <b>juvenile</b> individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.|$|E

40|$|To {{reveal the}} {{accumulation}} profile of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in pufferfish Takifugu rubripes <b>juveniles,</b> {{we compared the}} localization of TTX in various tissues among wild <b>juveniles</b> and hatchery-reared <b>juveniles</b> with or without TTX administration using immunohistochemical technique with anti-TTX monoclonal antibody. Immuno-positive reaction was observed in hepatic tissue, basal cell of skin and olfactory, olfactory epithelium, optic nerve and brain (optic tectum, cerebellum, medulla oblongata) of wild <b>juveniles</b> (body length: BL, 4. 7 - 9. 4 cm). TTX was detected in the same tissues as wild <b>juveniles</b> and epithelial cell layer of intestine of hatchery-reared <b>juveniles</b> (BL, 5. 0 - 5. 3 cm) to which TTX was orally administrated. No positive reaction was observed from the tissues of hatchery-reared <b>juveniles</b> without TTX administration.

40|$|The {{growth rate}} of Arcto-Norwegian cod <b>juveniles</b> in the Barents Sea during their first 4 mo of life is about twice that of cod <b>juveniles</b> in areas farther south, such as Georges Bank and the Flemish cap. Cod larvae and <b>juveniles</b> in the Barents Sea {{experience}} 24 h of daylight and thus the larvae and <b>juveniles</b> may continuously search for and capture prey. The stomach contents of cod <b>juveniles</b> caught in July 1989 were examined {{to determine if there}} were any diurnal patterns in stomach fullness or degree of digestion. No significant diurnal trends were detected. This suggests that feeding is continuous throughout the day, which enables the Barents Sea cod larvae and <b>juveniles</b> to grow more quickly than do cod <b>juveniles</b> farther south...|$|R
5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of <b>juvenile</b> material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH <b>juvenile</b> material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. <b>Juvenile</b> sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{are similar}} to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like {{moulting}} adults. <b>Juvenile</b> males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while <b>juvenile</b> females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some <b>juvenile</b> males lack any markings of the adult male, and some <b>juvenile</b> females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage.

Moreover, {{a thorough understanding of}} theraphosid biology and ecology is necessary from a conservation standpoint because natural populations may be threatened by habitat disturbances and captures for pet commerce. We described the behavior of conspecific individuals of Grammostola schulzei during non-sexual interactions, under laboratory conditions. Pairs of individuals involving adult males, adult females and <b>juveniles</b> were confronted and observed in resident and intruder conditions, totalizing 115 trials. When confronted two adult females, they retreated or grappled, and performed gaping display with bite attempts, usually resulted in severe injury of the intruder spiders. When confronted females with large <b>juveniles,</b> we frequently observed cannibalism on <b>juveniles.</b> <b>Juveniles</b> exposed to females or to other <b>juveniles</b> retreated or made leg tapping with forelegs and palpal drumming, which are common displays of courting adult males. Adult males courted and clasped some <b>juveniles,</b> but <b>juveniles</b> avoided or reject clasping.
