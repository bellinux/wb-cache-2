5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of <b>gasoline</b> with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure <b>gasoline</b> is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with <b>gasoline</b> blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure <b>gasoline</b> {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure <b>gasoline</b> (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E

5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a <b>gasoline</b> tank caught fire, {{believed}} to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed <b>gasoline</b> tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of <b>gasoline</b> from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in <b>gasoline</b> sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded <b>gasoline</b> and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure <b>gasoline,</b> pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with <b>gasoline</b> in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} branded product sales by selling <b>gasoline</b> in containers and from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded <b>gasoline</b> could be assured of its quality and consistent standard. (In the early 20th century, non-branded <b>gasoline</b> in the United States was often contaminated or of unreliable quality).|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Eesti Kiviõli and New Consolidated Gold Fields {{established}} the service station chain Trustivapaa Bensiini (now: Teboil) in Finland, which in 1940 sold more shale-oil-derived <b>gasoline</b> in Finland {{than did the}} entire conventional <b>gasoline</b> market in Estonia. Since 1935, Estonian shale oil has been supplied to the German Kriegsmarine as a ship fuel. In 1938, 45% of Estonian shale oil was exported, accounting for 8% of Estonia's total exports. Although {{the price of oil}} shale-based <b>gasoline</b> was at least triple that of global <b>gasoline</b> prices, high production and bilateral agreements with Germany facilitated its export. In 1939, Estonia produced 181,000tonnes of shale oil, including 22,500tonnes of oil that were suitable <b>gasoline</b> equivalents. The mining and oil industry employed 6,150 persons.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to <b>gasoline</b> to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded <b>gasoline</b> began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded <b>gasoline</b> additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} <b>gasoline</b> engines {{modified}} to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than <b>gasoline,</b> E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than <b>gasoline.</b> Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to higher detergent levels, Top Tier standards also require that <b>gasoline's</b> {{be free of}} metallic additives, which can be harmful to the emissions control systems in cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} derived from a series hybrid-drive {{propulsion}} system meant to use 40% of <b>gasoline's</b> potential energy while at optimum RPM (the typical car only uses 15% of <b>gasoline's</b> potential energy due to wide ranges of RPMs). The car was powered by a VM Motori 1.8 L three-cylinder turbocharged diesel, whose energy was diverted to a 180 lb, 300 V TMFbattery developed by Bolder Technologies in Golden, Colorado and two oil-cooled electric wheel motors. The electric motors were {{also part of the}} regenerative braking system, where energy normally lost through the disc brakes recharged the batteries.|$|R
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than <b>gasoline</b> because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than <b>gasoline,</b> flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure <b>gasoline.</b> However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than <b>gasoline</b> in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than <b>gasoline,</b> as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and prices at the pump are more competitive than <b>gasoline.</b> However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep <b>gasoline</b> price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E

25|$|<b>Gasolines</b> {{are also}} treated with metal deactivators, which are {{compounds}} that sequester (deactivate) metal salts that otherwise accelerate {{the formation of}} gummy residues. The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel.|$|R
50|$|Techron {{had been}} first {{patented}} and introduced as a concentrate available at Chevron stations in 1981. Techron was then marketed in all Chevron <b>gasolines</b> in May 1995, and the Chevron Cars made their debut to promote this introduction in advertising.|$|R

5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} ethanol blends with <b>gasoline,</b> and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified <b>gasoline</b> engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of fuel injected, replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects <b>gasoline</b> from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded <b>gasoline,</b> average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded <b>gasoline,</b> which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from <b>gasoline,</b> the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in <b>gasoline</b> during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded <b>gasoline</b> was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded <b>gasoline</b> and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

50|$|Autoxidation is {{a process}} of {{enormous}} economic impact, since all foods, plastics, <b>gasolines,</b> oils, rubber, and other materials that must be exposed to air undergo continuous destructive reactions of this type. All plastics and rubber and most processed foods contain antioxidants to protect them against the attack of oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Ethylene bromide was an {{additive}} in <b>gasolines</b> {{containing lead}} anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).|$|R
