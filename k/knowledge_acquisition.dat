5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
500|$|In {{the chapter}} [...] "Scully as a Pragmatist Feminist" [...] {{of the book}} The Philosophy of The X-Files, Erin McKenna argues that [...] "all things" [...] {{represents}} an [...] "important shift" [...] in Scully's approach to science, <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition,</b> {{and the pursuit of}} the truth. She reasons that the events of the episode open Scully's mind to new ways of knowing, specifically citing [...] "auras, chakras, visions... and the importance of coincidence". McKenna notes that Scully's shift in perspective is a shift to American pragmatism, a belief that reality is ever-changing. Pragmatists believe [...] "the truth is out there"—the motto of the series—in a manner similar to Mulder's. In [...] "all things", Scully begins to embrace pragmatism, although she still clings to her skeptic roots. Mixing the two, Scully evolves from a mere skeptic who demands proof to validate a truth, to an empiricist who wants proof, but is open to other perspectives.|$|E

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{typically}} {{the result of}} physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event. [...] It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge. Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers {{to the presence of}} retrograde amnesia while <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> remains intact (no anterograde amnesia). Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (implicit memory) may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (explicit memory) become inaccessible or lost. Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff's Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (Dissociative amnesia). Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions. However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients suffering from minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA. It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of explicit memory, hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Acquiring {{knowledge}}-intensive {{firms in}} order to gain access to their knowledge to innovate is not a strategy to achieve easily. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>acquisitions</b> demand that organizations integrate various dispersed knowledge-based resources and thus share knowledge to innovate. However, despite the growing number of <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisitions</b> an understanding regarding these knowledge sharing processes has remained absent. This paper argues that having an acquisition reconfiguration capability {{can be seen as a}} distinctive knowledge sharing ability of successful firms. The purpose of this paper is therefore to reveal the building blocks of such an acquisition reconfiguration capability {{in order to}} understand how to manage more successful <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisitions.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The approach of the research is to the review relevant literature while addressing two questions: "Which mechanisms, practices, and functions enable post-acquisition knowledge sharing?", and "How can these mechanisms, practices, and functions enable the creation of an acquisition reconfiguration capability in order to enable more successful knowledge acquisition?". Findings: Several propositions regarding the building blocks of an acquisition reconfiguration capability are given. First, it is argued that having prior acquisition experience will positively affect post-acquisition knowledge sharing. Second, various acquisition-specific tools and functions affect post-acquisition knowledge sharing and mediate the effect of <b>acquisition</b> experience. Finally, <b>knowledge</b> management tools and practices enhance post-acquisition knowledge sharing. Originality/value: This study is, to the authors' knowledge, one of the first to focus on the underlying mechanisms and practices that affect post-acquisition knowledge sharing and thus the building blocks of an acquisition reconfiguration capability. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
