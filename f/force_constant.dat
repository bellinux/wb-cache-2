40|$|A {{reliable}} {{prediction of}} interatomic <b>force</b> <b>constants</b> in disordered alloys {{is an outstanding}} problem. This {{is due to the}} need for a proper treatment of multisite (at least pair) correlation within a random environment. The situation becomes even more challenging for systems with a large difference in atomic size and mass. We propose a systematic density functional theory (DFT) based study to predict the ab initio <b>force</b> <b>constants</b> in random alloys. The method is based on a combination of special quasirandom structures and the augmented space recursion to calculate phonon spectra, density of states (DOS), etc. The bcc TaW and fcc NiPt alloys are considered as the two distinct test cases. The Ta-Ta (W-W) bond distance in the alloy is predicted to be smaller (larger) than those in pure Ta (W), which, in turn, yields stiffer (softer) <b>force</b> <b>constants</b> for Ta (W).

2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond <b>force</b> <b>constant,</b> ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are going to affect the vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, is going to cause a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large hysteresis loop.|$|E
