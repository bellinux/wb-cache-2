5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, a <b>flying</b> <b>saucer</b> or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

5|$|Filming for Never Say Never Again {{began on}} 27 September 1982 on the French Riviera {{for two months}} before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which {{was also one of}} the {{locations}} used in Thunderball. The Spanish city of Almería was also used as a location. Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic Fort Carré in Antibes. Largo's ship, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer,</b> was portrayed by the yacht Kingdom 5KR, then owned by Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi and called the Nabila. Principal photography finished at Elstree Studios where interior shots were filmed. Elstree also housed the Tears of Allah underwater cavern, which took three months to construct. Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mario {{is invited}} to the centennial Star Festival by Princess Peach to {{celebrate}} the comet that passes overhead, Bowser invades the Mushroom Kingdom with a surprise attack in a fleet of airships. Summoning a gigantic <b>flying</b> <b>saucer,</b> Peach's entire castle is removed from its foundations and is lifted into outer space. Mario is still at the castle's base until Kamek, one of Bowser's minions, launches Mario onto a small planet with his magic. On the planet, he meets an enchantress named Rosalina and her companions, the Lumas. Rosalina is a watcher of the stars, who uses the Comet Observatory to travel across the universe. However, Bowser has stolen all of the Power Stars that act as the Observatory's power source, rendering it immobile. Bestowed {{with the power to}} travel through space through one of the Lumas, Mario sets off on a journey across the universe to reclaim the Power Stars and restore power to Rosalina's observatory. Along the way, he finds friends from the Mushroom Kingdom such as Luigi and the Toads.|$|E

5|$|When {{the budget}} was {{projected}} at $100 million (Warner Bros. wanted it {{for no more}} than $75 million), producer Larry J. Franco commissioned a test reel from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the visual effects company he worked with on Jumanji. Burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation, which brought the final production budget to $80 million. Although Purves was uncredited for his work, stop-motion supervisors Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, who would later collaborate with Burton on Corpse Bride, received character design credit. Warner Digital Studios was responsible for the scenes of global destruction, airborne <b>flying</b> <b>saucer</b> sequences, the Martian landing in Nevada, and the robot that chases Richie Norris in his pickup truck. Warner Digital also used practical effects, such as building scale models of Big Ben and other landmarks. The destruction of Art Land's hotel was footage of the real-life night-time demolition of The Landmark Hotel and Casino, a building Burton wished to immortalize.|$|E
25|$|In July 1952, Edgar Jarrold {{founded the}} Australian <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> Bureau (AFSB) in Sydney. Its {{headquarters}} were in Fairfield. AFSB began publishing the Australian <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> Magazine in May 1953.|$|E
25|$|However, in Victoria the Australian <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> Research Society (Victorian Branch) (AFSRS Vic), {{now known}} as the Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), under Peter E.

In the first months of 1957 it was a branch of the Australian <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> Research Society (AFSRS) but later that year it also became {{independent}} and was re-organised as the Victorian <b>Flying</b> <b>Saucer</b> Research Society (VFSRS).|$|E

25|$|Donald Keyhoe later began {{investigating}} <b>flying</b> <b>saucers</b> for True Magazine. Keyhoe {{was one of}} {{the first}} significant conspiracy theorists, asserting eventually that the saucers were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission. Keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in Air Force and Navy intelligence. Project Sign, based at Air Technical Intelligence Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its successors Project Grudge and Project Blue Book were officially assigned to investigate the <b>flying</b> <b>saucers.</b> Edward Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the <b>flying</b> <b>saucers</b> were from outer space.|$|R

25|$|The sleek, silver <b>flying</b> <b>saucer</b> in {{particular}} {{is seen as a}} symbol of 1950s culture; the motif is common in Googie architecture and in Atomic Age décor.
