5|$|Banksia lemanniana <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{have a low}} to {{moderate}} susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E
5|$|Continuous passive motion (CPM) {{has been}} used to improve healing of the {{articular}} surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions.

Parathyroidectomy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of hyperparathyroidism {{as well as the}} symptoms of OFC.|$|E
50|$|Many algal species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{not only}} produce {{reactive}} oxygen species under normal conditions but to increase production of these compounds under stressful situations.

50|$|Delta waves {{can arise}} {{either in the}} {{thalamus}} or in the cortex. When associated with the thalamus, they are thought to arise in coordination with the reticular formation. In the cortex, the suprachiasmatic nuclei <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> regulate delta waves, as lesions <b>to</b> this area <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> cause disruptions in delta wave activity. In addition, delta waves show a lateralization, with right hemisphere dominance during sleep.Delta waves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mediated in part by T-type calcium channels. During delta wave sleep, neurons are globally inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).|$|R

However, cognitive flexibility <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E

A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
