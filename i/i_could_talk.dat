500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
2500|$|Little else {{is known}} about Kierkegaard's {{attitude}} to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. [...] "Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [...]" [...] (Journals, 1854) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E

60|$|NICHOLLS (almost brusquely). <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> to {{you from}} the hall. You're silly to take chances just now.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Your flow {{of words}} is simply amazing, Juan. How <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> {{like that to}} my soldiers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know—only I {{feel as if}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> {{straight}} off without arranging—like birds, without knowing what note is coming next." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> of Bendigo {{from here}} to king- [...] dom come, [...] I guess before I ended you would wish your [...] dad was dumb.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not used}} to making conversation," [...] he said. [...] "Is there {{anything}} in the world which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about likely to interest you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most of the time, I guess," [...] {{she said}} shortly. [...] "But come--come in. <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> under Selena's eyes, {{even if they}} were four hundred yards away." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{read her}} the placard, {{and let her}} lead {{me away from the}} subject. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> about it to any one, and how I longed for Eustace! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> on this subject. [...] "Go on, Pomona," [...] I said, {{trying to}} feel {{resigned}} to my shame, [...] "and {{tell us about}} that poster on the fence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just wish I had a {{telegraph}} or a telephone, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to Jill. Wouldn't it {{be fun to}} pipe {{across and}} get an answer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was rather}} tedious {{waiting in the}} hotel," [...] she explained. [...] "There was nobody <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to; my father is busy with a grain broker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should like}} to know whether you {{consider}} yourselves American or English," [...] she broke out. [...] "If once I knew <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to you accordingly." ...|$|E
5000|$|The gesture is {{possibly}} ancient in origin. In the biblical book of Job, {{there is a}} reference to it: Job 16: 4 <b>I</b> also <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> as you do, were you in my place. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> declaim over you, or wag my head at you; 5 <b>I</b> <b>could</b> strengthen you with talk, or shake my head with silent lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> with a {{girl like}} this; at least, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not meet her on her own {{conversational}} grounds. I was so agitated myself that it seemed unnatural that any one to whom I should speak should not also be agitated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{companies}} always remained {{small and}} personally run. B.B. King {{has said that}} he always felt the brothers were accessible: [...] "The company was never bigger than the artist. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>talk</b> to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{beautiful}} {{name for}} {{one who is}} beautiful," [...] I declared with enthusiasm, of course always in the rich Orofenan dialect which by now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> well enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow, [...] "that if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> with those Horners they would {{apologize}} to you, {{and then there}} would be no need to fight." ...|$|E
60|$|I was not sorry. I wanted {{somebody}} to whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about the matter, in whom I could confide. In ten minutes I {{was speaking to}} Walkirk in perfect confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{pleasure}} to me, and I liked the way he listened. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> {{a long time to}} such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is dreadful!" [...] said Corny. [...] "She {{ought to}} give up this pepper-pod {{business}} right away. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>talk</b> to her, I'd make her understand. But I must go get somebody for an interpreter." ...|$|R
60|$|Bessie. I think, {{if you let}} me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{manage to}} <b>talk</b> him round in a week, maybe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{tired of}} it," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want to come}} to grips with all these Rawdons. I think perhaps if I was hungry and savage <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to hungry men--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{have been}} so worried over the confounded business, that I have given up going to some friends as I had promised, as I didn't feel that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> about {{indifferent}} matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could help}} you," [...] said Clara. [...] "But I really {{know very little}} about such things. However, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to my father, who knows a very great deal of the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A great comfort;--only I wish it {{had been}} sooner. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> to you about things which I never did talk of to any one. I wonder why I {{should have been a}} duke, and another man a servant." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE DANE. My dear friend!--(then with {{a would-be}} humble look, {{and in a}} tone of voice as if he was reasoning) <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> so of prawns and imperfectum, and futurum and plusquamplue perfectum, and all dhat, my dear friend! without some lehrning? ...|$|R
6000|$|Torrance closed one hand. [...] "Grant of Fremont {{was my best}} friend, {{and when}} he died I 'most brought the lad up as a son. When he got hold of his foolish notions it hurt me considerably, and I did what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to <b>talk</b> him out of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since I {{left him}} I have walked all round by Bowick Lodge. I had {{something}} to think of before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> to you,--something to decide upon, indeed, before I could return to the house." ...|$|E

60|$|Here Kari {{looked at}} me, of whom I {{knew he was}} {{thinking}} all this time, and seeing that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> overhear his <b>talk,</b> began to speak of something else.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> {{found it}} <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>I</b> felt a new {{interest}} in it, for I love to talk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting, but if I had another to <b>talk</b> to <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be twice as interesting, and would never stop, if desired.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you dread {{the pain}} for him? I {{had talked to}} Tom about taking his profession; but the poor boy thinks he dislikes it greatly, though, I believe, his real taste lies that way, and his aversion only arises a few grand notions he has picked up, out of which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> soon <b>talk</b> him." ...|$|R
