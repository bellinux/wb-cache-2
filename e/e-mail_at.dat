2500|$|Development of {{the office}} suit Notis started in January 1978 out of the {{existing}} expertise in typesetting {{and a desire to}} sell computers to the public sector. [...] The word processing section was based on a program which had been developed by an employee while working at CERN and this was combined with systems for incorporating tables with figures such as budgets. The system also features search and <b>e-mail.</b> <b>At</b> first the QED text editor was used, but this was later replaced with TED, developed by Kvam Data. Notis was installed on all systems from 1980 and quickly became popular among customers. Because ND's screens were not optimized for text processing, from 1982 Tandberg Data delivered tailor-made keyboards and keyboards. Because text processing required high performance and extra peripherals, ND made high margins on the implementation. ND bought the typesetting system Comtec in 1981, which was combined with Nortext and resulted in large increases in the sale of the systems.|$|E

50|$|A {{directory}} harvest attack (DHA) is {{a technique}} used by spammers {{in an attempt to}} find valid/existent <b>e-mail</b> addresses <b>at</b> a domain by using brute force. The attack is usually carried out by way of a standard dictionary attack, where valid e-mail addresses are found by brute force guessing valid <b>e-mail</b> addresses <b>at</b> a domain using different permutations of common usernames. These attacks are more effective for finding e-mail addresses of companies since they are likely to have a standard format for official e-mail aliases (i.e. jdoe@example.domain, johnd@example.domain, or johndoe@example.domain).|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we use Poisson {{distribution}} {{as the time}} distribution for propagation between nodes. In the model, {{it is easy to}} use any statistical distribution or empirical data instead of Poisson distribution. We have made experiments with a model based on Uniform distribution. This describes, for example, propagation of information via e-mails when users process their <b>e-mails</b> <b>at</b> uniformly distributed time points during a day (or other time unit). This distribution gives comparable results, but not exactly the same, because more spreading occurs at low time values when propagation obeys Uniform instead of Poisson distribution.|$|R
