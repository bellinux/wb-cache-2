5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fist with his left hand.|$|E
5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> parachute jump from a helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Disc {{dogs are}} also popular attractions at {{sporting}} events as half-time entertainment. Going clear back to Ashley and his 8th inning performance in 1974, disc dogs have performed at countless football, basketball, baseball and soccer halftimes. They are many times found in amusement parks, county fairs and pet festivals of all kinds. There are a very small handful of trainers who <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living doing these shows.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Takashi Miike remade {{the film}} as The Great Yokai War. The film {{borrowed}} numerous elements from the Yokai Monsters series as well as Mizuki Shigeru's Kitarō story of the same name. Mizuki himself <b>even</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> cameo in the film.|$|R
25|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} {{and intensity of}} light: Electromagnetic radiation {{is a form of}} energy. As such, it may speed up the rate or <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> reaction spontaneous as it provides the particles of the reactants with more energy. This energy is {{in one way or another}} stored in the reacting particles (it may break bonds, promote molecules to electronically or vibrationally excited states...) creating intermediate species that react easily. As the intensity of light increases, the particles absorb more energy and hence the rate of reaction increases.|$|E
25|$|His {{inherent}} shyness {{can never}} fully explain his apparent cold indifference. His {{roots in the}} Normandy countryside may explain his love of the land but could not excuse his inability to <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> generous gesture. The hard life {{that his father had}} experienced could never pardon the economy of effort with which Jacques was obsessed. In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a few places where it was necessary to make an effort. He spent most of the time {{at the back of the}} bunch and did not even know the name of most of the riders.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing {{to a few}} hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E
50|$|Football stars begin feeling {{entitled}} to things, including favoritism in the classroom. One of them, Weaver, <b>even</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> pass at the coach's wife. Phil Sargeant is offended when given a passing grade for a chemistry test he didn't even complete. He quarrels with {{the coach and}} quits the team.|$|R
50|$|Gardner {{started his}} career at Aston Villa with older brother Craig, {{but before he could}} <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> {{appearance}} for the under-18s, he was forced out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in December 2009. He later returned from injury and became an important member of Aston Villa's under-18 and reserve sides.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bold was {{certainly}} treating Mr. Slope rather cavalierly, {{and he felt}} it so. She was rejecting him before he had offered himself, and informing him {{at the same time}} that he was taking a great deal too much on himself to be so familiar. She did not <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> attempt ...|$|R
500|$|Dahl {{said that}} the {{original}} novel was [...] "Ian Fleming's worst book, with no plot in it which would <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie", and compared it to a travelogue, stating {{that he had to}} create a new plot [...] " [...] I could retain only four or five of the original story's ideas." [...] On creating the plot, Dahl said he [...] "didn't know what the hell Bond was going to do" [...] despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks, and decided to do a basic plot similar to Dr. No. Dahl was given a free rein on his script, except for the character of Bond and [...] "the girl formula", involving three women for Bond to seduce— an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed, and the main Bond girl. While the third involved a character from the book, Kissy Suzuki, Dahl had to create Aki and Helga Brandt to fulfil the rest.|$|E
500|$|December {{opened with}} a home game against Santa Clara. The guests took an early lead, but Simão evened the score only fifteen minutes later; Mantorras then set the final score at a 2–1 win. On 8 December, Benfica played Paços de Ferreira on the road. Although they would have reached {{first place in the}} Primeira Liga standings if they had won, Benfica [...] "did not perform to expectations, as the defence was a disaster", {{according}} to Manuel Queiroz of Record. The game ended in a 1–2 loss, the first loss of the season. Four days later, Benfica played a fifth round Taça de Portugal game against Marítimo. The game went into overtime after no goals from either team in regular time; Two minutes into overtime, Marítimo scored. Benfica evened the score in the 116th minute, narrowly avoiding its second loss in a row. On 15 December, Benfica hosted Sporting. The game ended in a 2–2 draw, despite Benfica leading by two nil until the last five minutes, when Mário Jardel scored a double and saved the cross-town rivals from defeat. On the 19th, Benfica went to Madeira to play in the Portuguese Cup in a rematch against Marítimo. A sole goal from Mitchell van der Gaag knocked Benfica out of the competition. Benfica's last game of 2001 was on the road against Boavista. An early goal from Boavista made the game very difficult, as Manuel Queiroz explained in his match analysis: [...] "It was a game at their [...] style. Ball in the center, intense fighting, score early and then manage time, free-kicks and bookings... Benfica could not connect two passes, and <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> single imminent goal threat". With that the team took a second league loss. Three days later, Toni resigned, with Benfica looking for Mourinho to return. Disagreements over the composition of the technical staff caused Mourinho to decline the invitation, so Benfica turned to assistant manager Jesualdo Ferreira to lead the team.|$|E
2500|$|Description: Characterized {{by their}} rich, full {{sounding}} voices, dramatic sopranos {{are expected to}} project across large orchestras, a feat that requires a powerful sound. Dramatic sopranos {{are not expected to}} have the vocal flexibility of the lighter [...] Although most dramatic sopranos have a darker, more robust quality to the voice, there are some that possess a lighter lyrical tone. In these instances, however, the substantial amount of volume and endurance normally associated with the dramatic soprano voice is still present. The darker voiced dramatic soprano may <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> foray into the dramatic mezzo-soprano territory with great success.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of {{attaching}} real-world {{value to}} [...] "virtual" [...] items {{has had a}} profound effect on players and the game industry, and even the courts. The virtual currency selling pioneer IGE received a lawsuit from a World of Warcraft player for interfering in the economics and intended use of the game by selling WoW gold. Castronova's first study in 2002 found that a highly liquid (if illegal) currency market existed, with the value of Everquests in-game currency exceeding that of the Japanese yen. Some people <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living by working these virtual economies; these people are often referred to as gold farmers, and may be employed in game sweatshops.|$|E
2500|$|From July 31, 2005 until September 2, 2017 the TTC ran a {{pilot project}} of {{time-based}} transfers on this route, under which passengers who take a transfer may disembark and then board another streetcar from the same route, even one going in the opposite direction, {{as long as they}} do so within a certain amount of time after their original boarding. This means that one can stop part-way through a journey and then continue, or <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> round trip, without paying multiple fares. Since December 14, 2015, passengers who pay the driver at the farebox are now required to obtain a time-based transfer as a result of the Proof-of-payment (POP) system now in place on all TTC streetcar routes as passengers maybe asked at anytime to show POP. (NOTE: The time-based transfer pilot is not available on the Presto card itself, meaning Presto users who wish to take advantage of this pilot project will need to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special time-based transfer). This program will cease to exist as of September 3, 2017, when the new air-conditioned and accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars are rolled out onto this route, as drivers of the new streetcars are situated inside an enclosed cab meaning they are not responsible for fare collection or providing paper transfers.|$|E

50|$|Ingulf the Mad is {{the fourth}} book in Paul Edwin Zimmer's Dark Border series. This book differs from the {{previous}} three novels as Istvan Divega, the main character there, does not <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> appearance.
