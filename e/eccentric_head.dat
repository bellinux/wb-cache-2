40|$|Simultaneous object {{motion and}} self-motion {{give rise to}} complex {{patterns}} of retinal image motion. In order to estimate object motion accurately, the brain must parse this complex retinal motion into self-motion and object motion components. Although this computational problem can be solved, in principle, through purely visual mechanisms, extra-retinal information that arises from the vestibular system during self-motion may also play an important role. Here we investigate whether combining vestibular and visual self-motion information improves the precision of object motion estimates. Subjects were asked to discriminate the direction of object motion {{in the presence of}} simultaneous self-motion, depicted either by visual cues alone (i. e. optic flow) or by combined visual/vestibular stimuli. We report a small but significant improvement in object motion discrimination thresholds with the addition of vestibular cues. This improvement was greatest for <b>eccentric</b> <b>heading</b> directions and negligible for forward movement, a finding that could reflect increased relative reliability of vestibular versus visual cues for <b>eccentric</b> <b>heading</b> directions. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that vestibular inputs can help parse retinal image motion into self-motion and object motion components...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{vestibular}} rotation testing {{with the}} head centered on the axis stimulates the semicircular canals evoking compensatory eye movements. If the head is placed forwards of the axis in an eccentric position the otoliths are also stimulated by a tangential linear acceleration acting laterally to the skull. In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0. 1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with <b>head</b> centred and <b>eccentric</b> in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with <b>head</b> <b>eccentric</b> at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with <b>head</b> <b>eccentric</b> in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with <b>head</b> <b>eccentric</b> also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus {{with respect to the}} gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation. Patients with benign paroxysmal vertigo or chronic linear vertigo in whom otolithic abnormalities are suspected were not found to have abnormal responses with <b>head</b> <b>eccentric.</b> We conclude that this method of testing may be useful in elucidating pathophysiology but is not a decisive clinical test for the presence of disordered otolith function...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{search for}} and {{development}} of the optimal joint implant include preclinical testing. Restoration of the individual and natural biomechanics in the hip joint is a central goal in hip arthroplasty, and can be achieved by varying neck length, version and angle. Modular necks are one way to achieve these adjustments despite a growing concern regarding their outcome. In hip arthroplasty, the implants can be attached to the bone with or without cement. Both methods have achieved good clinical results. In this thesis, the effect of varying the femoral neck angle and length was tested in an experimental setup simulating everyday activities. Further, a cemented and an uncemented femoral stem with similar geometrical shape were compared in a preclinical setup. Methods: All implants were tested in human cadaver femurs by loading in a hip simulator in single leg stance and stair climbing activity. Changes in deformation pattern of the proximal femur were measured by strain gauges. Initial stability of the femoral stems was investigated using a micromotion jig. The effect on the deformation pattern and initial stability was studied when the neck version, angle and length were varied, due to either an <b>eccentric</b> femoral <b>head</b> or a modular neck. The deformation pattern and initial stability of a cemented and an uncemented stem of similar geometry were compared. Results: Strain was reduced in the proximal femur for all implants tested, especially proximally on the medial side, compared to the intact femur. Increased offset combined with retroversion or reduced neck–shaft angle in an <b>eccentric</b> femoral <b>head</b> gave significantly increased strain values compared to the standard situation. All three <b>eccentric</b> femoral <b>head</b> configurations gave overall small micromotion of the femoral stem; up to 40 μm. When testing the modular necks, the varus neck increased the micromotion up to 60 μm. Micromotion was significantly higher during stair climbing compared to single leg loading, and for distal level compared to proximal level in all modular necks. The short neck had higher loss of strain in distal position on the lateral side, and the retroverted neck retained more strain proximal medially. The cemented stem had slightly higher strains than the uncemented stem on the medial side, while uncemented stem had higher strains on the lateral side of the proximal femur. The differences were small, but statistically significant. Conclusion: Varying the femoral neck version, angle and length by either an <b>eccentric</b> femoral <b>head</b> or a modular neck gave some variations in cortical strains in the proximal femur compared to a standard design. However, the differences might be too small to have any clinical significance. The initial stability was acceptable for the tested implants when varying the femoral neck angle and length. The cemented stem was more stable than the uncemented stem, as expected. However, both stems had small micromotions at the bone-implant interface, and in a range, that is not expected to {{have a negative impact on}} long-term stability. </p...|$|R

40|$|During reach planning, we {{integrate}} multiple senses {{to estimate}} {{the location of the}} hand and the target, which is used to generate a movement. Visual and proprioceptive information are combined to determine the location of the hand. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether multi-sensory integration is affected by extraretinal signals, such as head roll. It is believed that a coordinate matching transformation is required before vision and proprioception can be combined because proprioceptive and visual sensory reference frames do not generally align. This transformation utilizes extraretinal signals about current head roll position, i. e. to rotate proprioceptive signals into visual coordinates. Since head roll is an estimated sensory signal with noise, this head roll dependency of the reference frame transformation should introduce additional noise to the transformed signal, reducing its reliability and thus its weight in the multi-sensory integration. To investigate the role of noisy reference frame transformations on multi-sensory weighting, we developed a novel probabilistic (Bayesian) multi-sensory integration model (based on Sober and Sabes, 2003) that included explicit (noisy) reference frame transformations. We then performed a reaching experiment to test the model’s predictions. To test for head-roll dependent multi-sensory integration, we introduced conflicts between viewed and actual hand position and measured reach errors. Reach analysis revealed that <b>eccentric</b> <b>head</b> roll orientations led to an increase of movement variability, consistent with our model. We further found that the weighting of vision and proprioception depended on head roll, which we interpret being a result of signal dependant noise. Consequently, the brain has online knowledge of the statistics of its internal sensory representations. In summary, we show that sensory reliability is used in a context-dependent way to adjust multi-sensory integration weights for reaching...|$|E
40|$|Background: This is a {{case report}} of a 36 mm {{constrained}} cup (Freedom™, Biomet IN) that performed successfully for 7 -years in a salvage case involving a total-femur implanted in a leg already short by 3 - 4 inches. The goal was to enhance hip motion and stability using a 36 mm head {{instead of the usual}} 32 mm size. Templating indications were for a 50 mm cup (Freedom™; Arcom™ liner). The proximal femur inserted in 2008 incorporated the 36 mm constrained THA and was anchored distally to bone using the Compress™ fixator. By 2012 the fixator loosened and was replaced by hinged total-knee arthroplasty (TKA). The THA was retained at revision and patient’s clinical follow-up was satisfactory for 4 years. As indicated by Martel radiographic method, the Arcom™ liner showed minimal wear over this period. Radiographs in Feb- 2016 showed the cup’s constraint ring had rotated slightly but the patient had no symptoms. By Dec- 2016, the patient had experienced three falls and also had heard a popping sound in her hip. At Dec- 2016 office visit, radiographs indicated additional rotation of the constraint ring and CT scans showed an <b>eccentric</b> <b>head</b> position contacting the metal shell. At revision, 50 % of the Arcom rim was ablated and the remainder present as a loose fragment. Following insertion of new Freedom liner and 36 mm head, her follow-up appears satisfactory 10 -months later. Her leg shortening remains but she walks to office visits using a cane and doesn’t need the cane at home. Methods: Retrieved Arcom liner and detached rim fragment were reconstructed, photographed, and then bi-valved for comparison to similarly prepared exemplar liners, one identical to our revision and one with a thicker wall. Details of liner sections were taken from photographs and reconstructed by computer graphics (Canvas Draw- 3 ™). Wear performance over the first 7 years was assessed using the Martel x-ray method. Results: Inspection of retrieved liner showed a large oval depression in the ablated rim. The contra-rim featured the large Arcom fragment and the underlying liner wall was less than 1 mm thick. Comparison to exemplar liners showed that the large fragment had separated along the lower edge of the constraint groove. Exemplars demonstrated a substantial rim buttress spanning 13 mm, which had been ablated in our retrieval. Discussion and Conclusion: Although this was not a high-demand patient, the considerable hip-impingement forces in a flail limb likely levered the head repeatedly against the liner’s constrained rim. Neck impingement was clearly evident in the damaged liner. A subluxing femoral head would also thin the contra-wall, as would backside wear. We do not know if the eccentric ring image in Feb- 2016 radiographs depicted failure. The liner may have escaped from the shell’s locking-ring and with activity, ablated the Arcom contours and led to rim fracture. It is also possible that the liner constraint was damaged when the patient fell, thereby allowing the liner to mobilize...|$|E
40|$|Current {{vestibular}} {{testing is}} limited. The general {{function of the}} vestibular system {{on both sides of}} the head can be tested, and one part of the peripheral vestibular organ, the horizontal semicircular canal, can be tested unilaterally. However, recently a test for the function of the otolith organs has been developed, the ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (oVEMP) test. This oVEMP test makes use of air-conducted sound (ACS) or bone-conducted vibration (BCV) to stimulate the otolith organs. Subsequently, the response can be recorded in the inferior eye muscles. Another relatively new test that can be employed for testing otolith function, is the unilateral centrifugation test. This method uses <b>eccentric</b> <b>head</b> positions during high speed rotation to stimulate the otolith organs unilaterally. In this thesis three main research questions regarding the tests described above were evaluated. 1. To explore the options of extending vestibular testing in relation to the otolith organs using recording of the oVEMPs. The ACS and BCV oVEMP were extensively studied and successfully implemented in vestibular testing. 2. To find new applications of oVEMP recording in relation to the diagnosis of specific vestibular diseases. The ACS oVEMP is a relevant addition in diagnosing Ménière’s disease. In Ménière’s patients the oVEMP response rates are lower, the amplitudes smaller and thresholds higher than in normal subjects. This effect is seen in both ears of Ménière’s patients. The affected ear is altered more than the clinically unaffected ear. Furthermore, it was found that in normal subjects the oVEMP tunes to a stimulus frequency of 500 Hz, with the highest amplitude and lowest threshold at this particular frequency, while for Ménière’s ears the best stimulus frequency was 1000 Hz. This ‘tuning effect’ was used to find a criterion to distinguish normal ears from Ménière’s ears. In otosclerotic disease the BCV oVEMP demonstrated that no significant differences in all oVEMP characteristics between normal and otosclerotic ears, and between otosclerotic ears before and after stapedotomy. Therefore it could be concluded that no or undetectably little damage to the utricle is caused by both otosclerotic disease and stapes surgery. Therefore screening with the BCV oVEMP in otosclerotic disease is not useful. On the contrary, in superior canal dehiscence the BCV oVEMP shows a significantly lower threshold and a higher amplitude in the dehiscent ear. 3. To develop a relatively simple unilateral centrifugation test for evaluation of the otolith organs. A new method of unilateral centrifugation was tested through registering of the tilt of the haptic SV induced by head tilt during on-axis body rotation. This provided a relatively uncomplicated alternative to test unilateral otolith function as compared to body and head translation during rotation. This thesis is an addition to the present knowledge with respect to diagnostic testing of the otolith organs, both on the basics of otolith testing, as well as more practically in the diagnosing of specific vestibulo-otologic diseases. This work will help the process of integrating otolith testing in daily practice...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{objective}} of this randomised trial was to compare surgical rotator cuff repair to simple decompression by acromioplasty and biceps tenotomy in patients older than 60 years of age with a mean follow-up of 4 years. HypothesisTendon repair produces better functional outcomes than simple decompression and prevents progression towards cuff tear arthropathy in the longer term. Patients and methodOf 130 initially included patients older than 60 {{years of age and}} having rotator cuff tears deemed amenable to surgical repair, 103 (79 %) were evaluated after a mean of 4 years. These patients had been randomly allocated to acromioplasty and tenotomy (AT group, n= 49) or to acromioplasty, tenotomy, and tendon suture (CR group, n= 54). The tear was distal in 41 patients, intermediate in 40, and retracted in 22. At last follow-up, the evaluation included the clinical Constant's Score, radiographs and, in the CR group, ultrasonography. ResultsThe complication rate was 4 %. The mean Constant Score was 44 preoperatively; values after 4 years were 76 overall (P= 0. 01), 78 in the CR group, and 73 in the AT group (P= 0. 01). The tendon-healing rate as assessed using ultrasonography was 63 %. The Constant Score was significantly better when tendon healing was achieved (82 / 73, P< 0. 001). In the AT group, the acromio-humeral distance was significantly shorter (6. 9 mm/ 7. 8 mm, P= 0. 03) and <b>eccentric</b> humeral <b>head</b> position was more common (44 %/ 26 %, P= 0. 01).
