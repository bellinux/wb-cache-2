25|$|Racing Club {{has also}} always defended the amateur {{spirit of the}} game and of sports in general. The {{creation}} of the Challenge Yves du Manoir responded to this ideal in a period (late 1920s-early 1930s) where French rugby was marred by violence and creeping professionalism. Yves du Manoir symbolised the romantic side of rugby, its carefree dimension, le jeu pour le jeu (playing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> playing).|$|E
25|$|Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only {{interested}} in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An {{example of this is}} in the story The Terror of the Transvaal where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant's foot. This is mostly a gag done <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> it. Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.|$|E
25|$|The sum {{paid out}} was {{so large that}} {{it was said that}} the crew of the ships {{involved}} roamed around Portsmouth with 'bank notes stuck in their hats, buying watches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> frying them, and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold-laced hat should be cobbed, so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up, but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace.' Each seaman involved received £182 4s 9¾d, the equivalent of ten years pay.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just <b>For</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fun</b> <b>Of</b> It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from {{the members of the}} court.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{criticized the}} large number of guest appearances, stating [...] "the {{propensity}} of guest artists makes it hard to actually get a grasp on the rising star's own voice."

Stylus Magazine wrote [...] "no one disappoints" [...] and despite the record being [...] "so obviously and deeply grounded in marketing, it’s still an outstandingly solid and enjoyable" [...] debut. The New York Times noted The Game's [...] "tough but straightforward rhyme style is appealing but not, usually, enthralling... This is a rapper who almost never forgets himself, who almost never loses himself in syllables just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] The Village Voice criticized the rapper's lyrical skills, saying, [...] "the Game's rhymes are about six degrees from totally artless". Yahoo!
