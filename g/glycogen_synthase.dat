5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
25|$|G6P, {{the product}} of glucokinase, is the {{principal}} substrate of glycogen synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with glycogen synthesis. When maximally active, GK and <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> appears to {{be located in the}} same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which glycogen synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of glycogen synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> and inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase.|$|E
25|$|Phosphoprotein {{phosphatase}} {{is activated}} by the hormone insulin, {{which indicates that}} there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> This leads to phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase's becoming inactive, while <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is activated. As a result, glycogen synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, and the net effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.|$|E
25|$|Another {{functional}} homolog, the Drosophila {{gene for}} <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3 (GSK3), called shaggy and abbreviated sgg, codes for a protein which phosphorylates Timeless (TIM), the fruit fly CRY functional homolog. Like dbt, shaggy {{is not a}} sequence homolog to casein kinase 1 epsilon. Conversely, Gsk3 {{is also found in}} mammals, and mutants have been implicated in circadian rhythm abnormalities in patients suffering with bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|The Insulin Receptor {{is a type}} of {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, with each subunit phosphorylating its partner. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in turn causing its acivation. This then catalyses the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate into Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a secondary messenger and induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol dependant protein kinase, which then activates several other kinases – most notably Akt, (also known as protein kinase B). Akt triggers the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) containing vesicles to the cell membrane, via the activation of SNARE proteins, to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. Akt also phosphorylates and inhibits <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase, which is an enzyme that inhibits <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> Therefore, Akt acts to start the process of glycogenesis, which ultimately reduces blood-glucose concentration.|$|E
25|$|Induce {{glycogen}} synthesis – When glucose {{levels are}} high, insulin induces {{the formation of}} glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key {{for the formation of}} glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In the {{canonical}} pathway, Wnt proteins binds to its transmembrane receptor of the Frizzled family of proteins. The binding of Wnt to a Frizzled protein activates the Dishevelled protein. In its active state the Dishevelled protein inhibits {{the activity of}} the <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3 (GSK3) enzyme. Normally active GSK3 prevents the dissociation of β-catenin to the APC protein, which results in β-catenin degradation. Thus inhibited GSK3, allows β-catenin to dissociate from APC, accumulate, and travel to nucleus. In the nucleus β-catenin associates with Lef/Tcf transcription factor, which is already working on DNA as a repressor, inhibiting the transcription of the genes it binds. Binding of β-catenin to Lef/Tcf works as a transcription activator, activating the transcription of the Wnt-responsive genes.|$|E
25|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E
500|$|In development, reelin is {{secreted}} by Cajal-Retzius cells. [...] Reelin {{acts as an}} extracellular {{ligand binding}} to ApoER2 and VLDLR on migrating neurons. A specific lysine residue on reelin binds to the first repeat on the ligand binding domain of ApoER2. This interaction with the two receptors activates intracellular processes that begin with the phosphorylation of Dab1, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylated protein which is encoded by the DAB1 gene. This protein associates with the NPXY motifs on the intracellular tails of ApoER2 and VLDLR. Upon reelin binding, Dab1 is phosphorylated by two tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src. The phosphorylated Dab1 then causes further activation of these two kinases and others, including a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activation leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of the tau kinase <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), which alters the activity of tau protein, a protein involved in stabilizing microtubules. This transduction is combined with the activation of other pathways that influence the cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for proper cortical cell migration.|$|E
2500|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is also {{stimulated by}} the insulin receptor via IRS-1. [...] In this case, it is the SH2 domain of PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) that binds the P-Tyr of IRS-1. [...] Now activated, PI-3K can convert the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). [...] This indirectly activates a protein kinase, PKB (Akt), via phosphorylation. [...] PKB then phosphorylates several target proteins, including <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3 (GSK-3). [...] GSK-3 is responsible for phosphorylating (and thus deactivating) <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> [...] When GSK-3 is phosphorylated, it is deactivated, and prevented from deactivating <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> [...] In this roundabout manner, insulin increases glycogen synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|If {{blood glucose}} levels are high, the body needs {{a way to}} store the excess glucose. [...] After being {{converted}} to G6P, the molecule {{can be turned into}} glucose-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. [...] Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis [...] of UTP, releasing phosphate. [...] Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> [...] This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. [...] It {{is important to note that}} glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. [...] On the other hand, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline.|$|E
2500|$|The cascade {{that leads}} to the {{insertion}} of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). This enzyme converts a phospholipid in the cell membrane by the name of [...] phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which, in turn, activates protein kinase B (PKB). Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing endosomes with the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane. PKB also phosphorylates <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase (GSK), thereby inactivating this enzyme. This means that its substrate, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> (GS), cannot be phosphorylated, and remains dephosphorylated, and therefore active. The active enzyme, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> (GS), catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose. Similar dephosphorylations affect the enzymes controlling the rate of glycolysis leading to the synthesis of fats via malonyl-CoA in the tissues that can generate triglycerides, and also the enzymes that control the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver. The overall effect of these final enzyme dephosphorylations is that, in the tissues that can carry out these reactions, glycogen and fat synthesis from glucose are stimulated, and glucose production by the liver through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are inhibited. The breakdown of triglycerides by adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol is also inhibited.|$|E
2500|$|AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in {{skeletal}} muscle by phosphorylating [...] Rab-GTPase-activating protein TBC1D1, which ultimately induces fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane. [...] AMPK stimulates glycolysis by activating phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2/3 and activating phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase, and it [...] inhibits glycogen synthesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> [...] In the liver, AMPK inhibits gluconeogenesis by inhibiting transcription factors including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2).|$|E
2500|$|As a meal {{containing}} carbohydrates or {{protein is}} eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes {{to stimulate the}} action of several enzymes, including <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase.</b> Glucose molecules {{are added to the}} chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or [...] "fed" [...] state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, some ER may {{associate}} with cell membranes by attachment to caveolin-1 and form complexes with G proteins, striatin, receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR and IGF-1), and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., Src). [...] Through striatin, {{some of this}} membrane bound ER may lead to increased levels of Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO). [...] Through the receptor tyrosine kinases, signals are sent to the nucleus through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pl3K/AKT) pathway. [...] <b>Glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase-3 (GSK)-3β inhibits transcription by nuclear ER by inhibiting phosphorylation of serine 118 of nuclear ERα. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β removes its inhibitory effect, and this {{can be achieved by}} the PI3K/AKT pathway and the MAPK/ERK pathway, via rsk.|$|E
2500|$|The Wnt/β-catenin pathway {{starts with}} the binding of Wnt to a {{receptor}} complex encompassing a Fz receptor and LRP co-receptor. [...] After Wnt binds, an intracellular protein named Dishevelled (Dvl) is activated via phosphorylation. β-catenin degradation complexes in the cytoplasm are composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Axin. [...] APC promotes the degradation of β-catenin by increasing the affinity of the degradation complex to β-catenin. [...] Axin is a scaffolding protein which holds the degradation complex together. [...] The activated Dvl associates with Axin and prevents GSK3β and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) from phosphorylating critical substrates, such as β-catenin. [...] Phosphorylation of β-catenin marks the protein for ubiquitylation and rapid degradation by proteasomes. [...] Thus, the binding of Wnt to the receptor results in a non-phosphorylated form of β-catenin which localizes to the nucleus and, after displacing the Groucho corepressor protein, forms a complex with Tcf/Lef transcription factors and co-activators (such as CREB binding protein) and induces the expression of downstream target genes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cellular}} {{level of}} beta-catenin is mostly controlled by its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TrCP1 (also known as β-TrCP) can recognize β-catenin as its substrate through a short linear motif on the disordered N-terminus. However, this motif (Asp-Ser-Gly-Ile-His-Ser) of β-catenin {{needs to be}} phosphorylated on the two serines {{in order to be}} capable to bind β-TrCP. Phosphorylation of the motif is performed by <b>Glycogen</b> <b>Synthase</b> Kinase 3 alpha and beta (GSK3α and GSK3β). GSK3s are constitutively active enzymes implicated in several important regulatory processes. There is one requirement, though: substrates of GSK3 need to be pre-phosphorylated four amino acids downstream (C-terminally) of the actual target site. Thus it also requires a [...] "priming kinase" [...] for its activities. In the case of beta-catenin, the most important priming kinase is Casein Kinase I (CKI). Once a serin-threonine rich substrate has been [...] "primed", GSK3 can [...] "walk" [...] across it from C-terminal to N-terminal direction, phosphorylating every 4th serine or threonine residues in a row. This process will result in dual phosphorylation of the aforementioned β-TrCP recognition motif as well.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{mechanistic}} role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, {{transgenic mouse}} {{studies have shown}} somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably {{to compensate for the}} loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. [...] Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control of}} <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> {{is a key}} step in {{regulating}} glycogen metabolism and glucose storage. <b>Glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is directly regulated by <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> kinase 3 (GSK-3), AMPK, protein kinase A (PKA), and casein kinase 2 (CK2).

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase-D phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase, UDP-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase, UDPglucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase, glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase, glycogen synthetase phosphatase, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> phosphatase, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> D phosphatase, Mg2+ dependent <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> phosphatase, and phosphatase type 2_degree_C.|$|E
50|$|Allosteric {{activation}} by glucose 6 phosphate, {{which acts}} as an effector, stimulates <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> and glucose 6 phosphate may inhibit the phosphorylation of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> by cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase.|$|E
50|$|Much {{research}} has been done on glycogen degradation through studying the structure and function of glycogen phosphorylase, the key regulatory enzyme of glycogen degradation. On the other hand, much less is known about the structure of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> the key regulatory enzyme of glycogen synthesis. The crystal structure of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, however, has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. In its asymmetric form, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is found as a dimer, whose monomers are composed of two Rossmann-fold domains. This structural property, among others, is shared with related enzymes, such as glycogen phosphorylase and other glycosyltransferases of the GT-B superfamily. Nonetheless, a more recent characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> crystal structure reveals that the dimers may actually interact to form a tetramer. Specifically, The inter-subunit interactions are mediated by the α15/16 helix pairs, forming allosteric sites between subunits in one combination of dimers and active sites between subunits in the other combination of dimers. Since the structure of eukaryotic <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is highly conserved among species, <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> likely forms a tetramer in humans as well.|$|E
5000|$|For enzymes in the GT3 family, these {{regulatory}} kinases inactivate <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> by phosphorylating {{it at the}} N-terminal of the 25th residue and the C-terminal of the 120th residue. <b>Glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> is also {{regulated by}} protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which activates <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> via dephosphorylation. [...] PP1 is targeted to the glycogen pellet by four targeting subunits, GM, GL, PTG and R6. These regulatory enzymes are regulated by insulin and glucagon signaling pathways.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{catalytic}} mechanisms used by <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> are {{not well}} known, structural similarities to glycogen phosphorylase at the catalytic and substrate binding site suggest that the mechanism for synthesis is similar in <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> and glycogen phosphorylase.|$|E
50|$|Research {{literature}} suggests that over-activity of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase,</b> the key enzyme in synthesizing glycogen, {{can lead to the}} formation of polyglucosans. <b>Glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> can be inactivated by phosphorylation at various amino acid residues by many molecules, including GSK-3beta. Protein phosphatase 1 can take out these phosphate moieties and make <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> active. However, PP-1 needs other proteins, like PTG (Protein Targeted to Glycogen), to assist. Malin, another protein mutated in Lafora disease, aids in the degradation of PTG, with assistance from laforin via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Hence in a malin mutation, PTG might accumulate and cause excessive <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> activity, leading to abnormal glycogen production. However, this supposition has not been confirmed by animal models.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} study of {{transgenic}} mice, an overexpression of <b>glycogen</b> <b>synthase</b> and an overexpression of phosphatase both resulted in excess glycogen storage levels.
