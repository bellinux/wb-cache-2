40|$|<b>Decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> program, {{deemed to}} have less or no {{distortion}} on domestic production and trade, is largely implemented to support the farmers’ revenue in the EU agrofood sector. However it is analyzed by Moschini and Sckokai (1994) that when lump-sum transfer is not available, <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> is more efficient than coupled subsidies only when the income target for the farmers is high. Based on this idea, this paper analyzes the efficiency of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> in an imperfect competitive agrofood sector where raising public funds to finance <b>decoupled</b> <b>payment</b> is costly.

30|$|In {{the context}} of the {{potential}} relationship between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and risk management decisions, Hennessy (1998) concluded in a US study that the term “decoupled” can be misleading as both the wealth effect and the presence of risk aversion can ensure that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> affect production decisions. Indeed, Finger and Lehmann (2012) found among Swiss farmers that DP {{have a negative effect on}} the demand for hail insurance as a risk management strategy. Similarly, Koundouri et al. (2009) found that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> significantly altered the risk attitude of farmers in Finland after European Union accession. The literature has not always, however, identified a significant relationship between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and risk attitudes or risk management decisions (Serra et al. 2011).

30|$|The {{findings}} of this study can be interpreted {{in a number of different}} ways. One may conclude that the positive association between <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> and income risk is welcome as <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> appear targeted towards farms with a higher risk profile. However, under an expected utility framework, the results are somewhat concerning. In this framework, the positive relationship suggests that <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> induce farmers to take on greater risks in their market activities and that those farms with the largest payments are given an advantage in terms of their scope to manage market risks. The results suggest that some degree of asset integration is present and that the value of the <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> influence risk management behaviour.|$|E

40|$|In 2020, <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> will {{represent}} about 42 % of the CAP budget (green payments excluded). This report assesses the potential effects of European <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> on farmers' production decisions, {{prior to a}} sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated {{with the aim of}} deriving plausible behavioural parameters that improve the representation of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> in economic simulation models. To capture completely decoupled production behaviour, many CGE models typically represent <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> as a uniform subsidy rate to the land using (agricultural) sectors. Nevertheless based on a thorough review of the literature, it appears that a more suitable modelling approach which caters for heterogeneous member state land markets, may be to split the allocation of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments.</b> On the one hand, a proportion is committed to land {{as a function of the}} capitalisation rate into the rental value, whilst a second tranche is distributed uniformly across all factors, reflecting a balance of different coupling channels.

40|$|Abstract Among the {{numerous}} non-point sources of diffuse water pollution with nitrogen, agriculture is counted {{one of the}} main sources. The agricultural policies of the Agenda 2000 and a <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>payments</b> for farmers from their production decisions are exemplarily evaluated as nitrogen reduction measures using the Regional Agricultural and Environmental Information System RAUMIS. The results show that until the target year 2010 the risk of diffuse pollution of water bodies with nitrogen is a regional problem in Germany. These problems are neither mitigated by the policies of Agenda 2000 nor by a <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>payments</b> from production decisions of farmers. While total nitrogen surplus reduces considerably after a <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>payments</b> due to decreases of land-use the nitrogen surplus on the remaining cultivated area increases resulting from structural changes. Granting the same amount of direct payments to farmers in both policy alternatives the agricultural sector income would be higher after a <b>decoupling</b> of direct <b>payments</b> opposed to the Agenda 2000 resulting from a more efficient allocation of inputs...|$|R

40|$|Decoupled direct {{payments}} {{were introduced in}} the European Union (EU) by the 2003 CAP reform in form of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and the Single Area Payment System (SAPS). The 2013 CAP reform changed both the implementation of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> {{as well as its}} budget. We assess the possible effects of the 2013 CAP reform on the capitalization of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> in land rental values. Our estimates suggest that the CAP reform leads to an increase in the capitalization of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> by additional 16 cents for each EUR of <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> relative to the pre-reform situation. However, there is a relatively large variation in the reform effects between MS particularly between Old Member States (OMS) and New MS (NMS). In NMS the capitalization rate slightly reduces from 76 % in the pre-reform period to 72 % in the post-reform period. Although, the rate is significantly lower in OMS, it almost doubles (from 20 % to 39 %) due to the reform. The main source of the post-reform capitalization in the EU are the entitlement stock changes accounting for 19 % of total post-reform capitalization level, followed by the internal convergence of payments with 18 %, the budget change (including external convergence) with 1 %, and the differentiation of payments (redistributive payment) with - 7 %. Overall, our estimates suggest that on average in the EU, the non-farming landowners’ policy gains are 25 % of total <b>decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> in the post-reform period compared to 17 % in the pre-reform period.

40|$|<b>Decoupled</b> <b>payments</b> are {{lump-sum}} income {{transfers to}} farm operators {{that do not}} depend on current production, factor use, or commodity prices.
