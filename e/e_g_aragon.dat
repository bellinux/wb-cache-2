40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that goal priming effects are context dependent. We show that goal primes encourage prime-consistent behavior when the behavioral context is common and prime-inconsistent behavior when the behavioral context is un-common. While the prime-consistent behavior is compatible with existing theory, the prime-inconsistent behavior poses a theoretical challenge. We argue that un-common behavioral contexts encourage {{the release of a}} primed goal and, as a consequence, an increase in the relative activation of information inconsistent with the primed goal and prime-inconsistent behavior. The influence of priming in consumer behavior is ubiq-uitous. Primes have been shown to influence product evaluations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Brendl, Markman, and Messner 2003), consideration set formation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shapiro 1999), choices (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Chun and Kruglanski 2005; Sheeran et al. 2005), the extremity of behavior (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang, Reed, and Croson 2008), and product experience (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Aaker and Stayman 1992). The pervasive influence of primes has also led to an exten-sive documentation of the processes supporting priming ef-fects. Priming effects have been attributed to self-concept activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Shang et al. 2008; Wheeler, DeMarree, and Petty 2007), information accessibility (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Wheeler and Berger 2007), trait activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Srull and Wyer 1979), exemplar activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Stapel, Koomen, and Velthuijsen 1998), category activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Bargh, Chen, and Burrows 1996), habit activation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Sheeran et al. 2005), mimicr...|$|R

The biological relevance of food choices, {{the complexity of the}} food-rich environment in which we presently live (making food-intake regulation difficult), and the increasing health care cost due to illness associated with food (food hazards, food contamination, and aberrant food-intake). Despite the importance of the issues and the relevance of this research, comprehensive and validated databases of stimuli are rather limited, outdated, or not available for non-commercial purposes to independent researchers who aim at developing their own research program.

This study aims to: (1) identify young men's perceived motivators and barriers in adopting healthy eating and physical activity behaviours, and (2) explore any differences in responses by weight status categories. Methods: Ten focus groups (32 - 63 minutes; 3 - 9 participants per group) were conducted with 61 young men (BMI: 25. 3 ± 5. 1 kg/m², aged: 18 - 25 years) from the Hunter region, New South Wales, Australia. There were 35 (57. 4 %) healthy weight men and 26 (42. 6 %) overweight/ obese men. Three groups were with healthy weight participants, three with overweight/obese participants and four with mixed-BMI participants. Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was conducted by an independent researcher using NVIVO 10. Results: Motivators for healthy eating grouped into four themes: physical health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to live longer), sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> to support their sporting goals), physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness) and social influences (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> societal expectations to eat healthy), while key motivators for physical activity were: physical appearance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> sexual attractiveness), social inclusion (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> making friends), physical and mental health (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> relieve stress) and improvements for sport or performance (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> improve fitness). Themes for key barriers to eating healthy were: intrinsic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> perceived effort to adopt healthy eating), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> peer influence), while busy lifestyles (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> lack of time), logistic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> cost), cognitive-emotional (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> feelings of inferiority) and social factors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> family upbringing) were key barriers for physical activity. Responses varied little by BMI status. Conclusion: This research emphasises the importance of consulting young men when developing healthy lifestyle programs that aim to promote healthy eating and physical activity in young men. Future research is needed to identify the most effective ways to address their motivators and barriers in intervention research...|$|R
