25|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars and {{the long}} period of {{relative}} peace that followed caused a decline in both {{the number of new}} ships demanded by the navy and the number that needed to be repaired and maintained. Deptford's location and the shallow riverine waters exacerbated the problem as work and contracts were moved to other royal dockyards. The yard had its location close to the main navy offices in London in its favour, but the silting of the Thames and the trend towards larger warships made continued naval construction there an unappealing prospect. Engineer John Rennie commented of the yard that Ships-of-the-line which are built there cannot as I am informed with propriety be docked and coppered. Jury masts are put into them and they are taken to Woolwich, where they are docked, coppered and rigged, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> of an instance where many weeks elapsed before a fair wind and tide capable of floating a large ship down to Woolwich occurred.|$|E
500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the claims from Schwarzenegger's camp, Angelides campaign manager Cathy Calfo dismissed the claims as being politically motivated and [...] "completely false." [...] In regards to the recording she stated: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> is, there was information accessed by one of our computers off of a taxpayer-funded, publicly available Web site that {{any member of the}} public would have access to..." [...] She also expressed regret that Sullivan and Newman submitted the tape without consulting {{with other members of the}} campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The advert for the India–Pakistan match {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} India, but Pakistanis [...] "ran afoul and used every possible media front {{to oppose the}} campaign." [...] The Express Tribune wrote that the campaign [...] "had successfully ignited a ‘healthy’ sporting rivalry in the most subtle way as possible." [...] Regarding the positive response for the jingle, Khan said in a TV show, [...] "I never thought this would become such a popular jingle. It is on everybody’s lips these days. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that the Indian team in Australia has also liked it very much." ...|$|E
2500|$|The visa {{program was}} {{suspended}} on September 3, 1940, and officially ended on November 20, 1941. The Spanish and Portuguese governments had already refused to issue travel visas for those using the immigration visas to Brazil. [...] Innitzer updated the Vatican {{again on the}} increased pace of the deportations on May 20, 1942, and the Vatican tried {{for the last time}} to appeal to the Brazilians in July 1942. Maglione wrote in December 1941 to the bishop whose request had initiated the project that: [...] "as you have certainly been informed [...] many emigrants have departed andI regret to sayfrom what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told,</b> a good many of them, both by their improper conduct and alleged demands, have not corresponded to the concern which the Holy See has shown in their behalf". The emphasis of Maglione's letter was not on the failure of a diplomatic effort, but chagrin at the alleged conduct and lack of gratitude of the recipients of the visas. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, by [...] "improper conduct", Maglione could only have meant that the recipients continued to practice Judaism.|$|E

2500|$|In 1895 British {{archeologist}} Alfred Percival Maudslay and his wife, Anne Cary Maudslay, visited Zaragoza {{on their}} way from Antigua Guatemala to Santiago Atitlán. [...] Anne Maudslay told her adventure in the book A glimpse at Guatemala, from the Victorian Era perspective: [...] "After riding {{a mile or two}} along a road bordered by cottages bosomed in fruit trees we rose to a bleak tableland. [...] It was {{one of the very few}} days of unpleasant weather which we experience during the whole of our journey; a fierce wind raised clouds of dust and rustled through the ugly dry rastrojos, or stubbles of Indian corn, which covered the plain. We passed through the little Indian town of Zaragoza, chiefly noted for the manufacture of aparejos, the native pack-saddles. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that the Indians here have such a liking for dried alligator meat as a Lenten fare that the vendors of the highly-perfumed delicacy have to be locked up in the carcel (English: Jail for protection and sell the meat through the prison bars. [...] The streets were full of gaily-dressed people assembled for a fiesta, and dancing was going on in a shed, to a monotonous sound of a marimba. [...] We were not tempted to loiter for long, and rode on again over the dull plan to uninteresting town of Chimaltenango." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antoine Roquentin – The {{protagonist of}} the novel, Antoine {{is a former}} adventurer who {{has been living in}} Bouville for three years. Antoine does not keep in touch with family, and has no friends. He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. He settles in the fictional French seaport town of Bouville to finish his {{research}} on the life of an 18th-century political figure. But during the winter of 1932 a [...] "sweetish sickness," [...] as he calls nausea, increasingly impinges on almost everything he does or enjoys: his research project, the company of an autodidact who is reading all the books in the local library alphabetically, a physical relationship with a café owner named Françoise, his memories of Anny, an English girl he once loved, even his own hands and the beauty of nature. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. His relationship with Françoise is mostly hygienic in nature, for the two hardly exchange words and, when invited by the Self-Taught Man to accompany him for lunch, he agrees only to write in his diary later that: [...] "I had as much desire to eat with him as I had to hang myself." [...] He can afford not to work, but spends a lot of his time writing a book about a French politician of the eighteenth century. Antoine does not think highly of himself: [...] "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> so." [...] When he starts suffering from the Nausea he feels the need to talk to Anny, but when he finally does, it makes no difference to his condition. He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: [...] "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?" ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Leonard Horner {{also took}} me once {{to a meeting}} of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President, and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a position. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and to my having {{attended}} the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these Societies, more than any other similar honour. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> at that time that I should one day <b>have</b> <b>been</b> thus honoured, <b>I</b> declare that <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> that <b>I</b> should be elected King of England.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retirement}} he chaired Enterprise Ulster from 1973-1979.
