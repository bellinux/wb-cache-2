5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium is easy to <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium.

5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> the Diolkos on its territory, {{but the fact that the}} trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{determined}} the activity of <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> Bangladeshi medicinal plants (Emblica officinalis, Aegle marmelos, Vernonia anthelmintica, Oroxylum indicum, Argemone mexicana) on human breast tumor cell lines. <b>Extracts</b> <b>from</b> E. officinalis and O. indicum displayed anti-proliferative activity on MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell lines, while <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> A. mexicana were active on MCF 7 cells, exhibiting on the contrary low antiproliferative effects on MDA-MB- 231 cells. <b>Extracts</b> <b>from</b> A. marmelos and V. anthelmintica were antiproliferative on both cell lines, but at higher concentrations. The accumulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mRNA, a marker of neoplastic status, was analysed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The data obtained demonstrated that only <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> E. officinalis induce an increase of ERalpha mRNA in MCF 7 cells. When MDA-MB- 231 cell line was employed, <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> E. officinalis, V. anthelmintica and A. mexicana {{were found to be}} inducers of the increase of ERalpha mRNA accumulation. Since activation of ERalpha gene expression could have clinical impact, our results suggest a possible use of <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> medicinal plants to identify compounds of possible interest in the treatment of breast cancer...|$|R

5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to <b>extract</b> <b>from</b> plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
