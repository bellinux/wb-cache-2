50|$|The blue grenadier, hoki, blue hake, New Zealand whiptail, whiptail or whiptail hake, Macruronus novaezelandiae, is a merluccid hake of {{the family}} Merlucciidae found around {{southern}} Australia and New Zealand at depths of between 10 and 1000 m. It feeds in midwater on small squids, crustaceans, and fish. Its length is between 60 and 120 cm. It is a slender, silvery fish similar in appearance to the <b>gemfish.</b> The meat of the fish is white and almost always sold in filets.|$|E
40|$|The meat of Ruvettus pretiosus and Lepidocybium flavobrunneum (<b>gemfishes)</b> {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} indigestible wax esters that provoke gastrointestinal disorders. Although some countries have banned {{the sale of}} these species, mislabeling cases {{have been reported in}} sushi catering. This work developed a simple conventional multiplex PCR, which discriminates the two toxic <b>gemfishes</b> from other potentially replaced species, such as tunas, cod, and sablefish. A common degenerate forward primer and three species-specific reverse primers were designed to amplify cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene regions of different lengths (479, 403, and 291 bp) of <b>gemfishes,</b> tunas, and sablefish, respectively. A primer pair was designed to amplify a fragment (193 bp) of the cytb gene of cod species. Furthermore, a primer pair targeting the 16 S rRNA gene was intended as common positive control (115 bp). The method developed in this study, by producing the expected amplicon for all of the DNA samples tested (reference and commercial), provides a rapid and reliable response in identifying the two toxic species to combat health frauds...|$|R
50|$|Rexea solandri, the Silver <b>gemfish,</b> is {{a species}} of snake {{mackerel}} found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean around Australia and New Zealand with reports of possible records from Madagascar and Japan. This species occurs in schools at depths of between 100 to 800 m though mostly between 300 to 450 m. This species can reach a length of up to 110 cm SL and a maximum weight of 16 kg has been recorded. This species is important to local commercial fisheries.|$|E
50|$|Nesiarchus nasutus, the Black <b>gemfish,</b> is {{a species}} of snake {{mackerel}} found in tropical and subtropical waters {{in most parts of}} the world, though not in east Pacific and north Indian waters. It occurs at depths of from 200 to 1200 m though they make diel vertical migrations from benthopelagic to mesopelagic depths at night. This species can reach a length of 130 cm SL though most do not exceed 80 cm SL. It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries. This species is currently the only known member of its genus, Nesiarchus. That genus is thus considered monotypic.|$|E
40|$|Temporal trends {{through the}} winter seasons in {{commercial}} landings of eastern <b>gemfish</b> (Rexea solandri) during the years 1977 - 79, 1982 - 85, 1986 - 87 and 1989 - 92 were reasonably stable for given latitudes, despite variable oceanographic influences, as depicted by 250 m isotherm data. This suggests that the overall pattern of occurrence of pre-spawning aggregations of eastern <b>gemfish</b> in these periods was determined {{by a combination of}} time of the season and latitude, rather than by oceanographic factors. Between 1986 and 1996, only four instances were identified where <b>gemfish</b> catches contained > 10 % of 'running ripe' females, and the variety of oceanographic conditions under which these catches were made provides little support for the hypothesis that eastern <b>gemfish</b> spawn into subsurface plumes of upwelled sub-Antarctic water...|$|E
40|$|Experienced fishers {{believe the}} winter aggregations of <b>gemfish</b> are {{influenced}} by the following: cold bottom currents from the south and east flowing up onto the shelf; the edge of warm-core eddies; and topographic features along the shelf break. These claims were tested through observations made at sea during industry surveys of the winter <b>gemfish</b> seasons 1996 - 98, and the study of 250 m isotherm charts, sea surface temperature data, and historic catch data. The study generally confirmed the anecdotal information collected from the fishers. The first <b>gemfish</b> aggregations of the winter season often form on the southern edge of a warm-core eddy. Secondarily, aggregations tend to form around the northern edge of the warm-core eddy if it is interacting with the shelf break. Finally, <b>gemfish</b> aggregate around {{the point at which the}} main flow of the East Australian Current (EAC) detaches from the continental shelf. This timing and location apparently coincides with conditions conducive to the production of subsurface plumes of nutrient-rich deep Sub-Antarctic mode Water. These plumes lead to seasonal enhancement of phytoplankton growth along the edge of the continental shelf, which may offer the adaptive advantage of enhancing the survival and growth of larval <b>gemfish...</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the quantity of omega 3 (n- 3) fatty acids in commonly consumed species of South Australian fish. Omega 3 fatty acids ranged from 17. 7 % to 53. 7 % of total fat with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) as the major omega 3 fatty acid in all 26 species tested (range 9. 5 % to 47. 1 % of total fat). The levels of total omega 6 (n- 6) fatty acids ranged from 2. 3 % to 20. 2 % of total lipids, chiefly as arachidonic acid (AA, 20 : 4 n- 6). Fatty fish such as <b>Gemfish,</b> Atlantic Salmon and Swordfish were found to be good sources of omega- 3 fatty acid (1360, 2252 and 2571 mg/ 100 g fish respectively), while low fat fish such as Ling, Deep Sea Bream (Blue Warhou) and Blue Grenadier (0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 7 % fat) had low levels of omega 3 fatty acid (222, 257 and 247 mg/ 100 g). Because most white table fish consumed by Australians are so low in fat they are actually a limited source of omega 3 fats. The amount of fish required to be consumed to provide 1 g of omega 3 fatty acid per day ranged from 40 to 450 g. Soltan SS and Gibson RA. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Parasites {{can be held}} {{responsible}} for a substantial number of sea-food associated infections. The prevalence of infection and the identification of Ascaridoidea sp. larvae in three species of Flathead fish and four <b>Gemfish</b> were investigated. A total of 1313 nematode larvae were collected from 42 fishes (n= 64). Larvae were found in the body cavity attached to the wall of the stomach, intestine, gonad and rectum. The prevalence of nematodes was 65, 63 %, with a mean intensity of 31, 26 ± 2, 51 (larvae/ infected host). Dusky flatheads had significant less nematode larvae then Tiger or Sand flatheads. The highest mean of infection occurred in Sand flatheads (32, 83 ± 2, 51) with a range of 0 - 184. The highest number of anisakid larvae recorded was 196 from a Tiger flathead. Identification of larvae was conducted using morphological and genetic characterisation. Based on morphological examination 13 different larvae types were found; 1 type of Anisakis sp., 1 type of Contracaecum sp., 1 type of Terranova sp. and 10 types of Hysterothylacium sp. A number of these larvae are described and figured. A number of samples were genetically characterised using sequence data obtained from the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS- 1 and ITS- 2) of genomic DNA (gDNA). Combining morphological characters of anisakidae larvae with genetic identification was an effective way of matching incompletely identifiable nematodes using reference sequences and provide a basis for further identification of populations of anisakid larvae in fish as well as their life cycles, epidemiology, taxonomy and population biology...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalization}} of the seafood supply chain has progressively {{led to the}} presence of an extremely wide gamma of new commercial species (fish and shellfish but also unconventional seafood) {{as well as to the}} massive entrance of numerous types of processed products on international markets. The growth in European imports from third countries and particularly from China, which despite its central role in the world’s seafood market effectively lacks a suitable regulation for fishery products, represents an important challenge for international traceability control systems. The impossibility to appeal to visual identification in processed commodities has in fact made easier the fraudulent substitution of high-value products with less expensive or lower quality alternatives, damaging world economy as well as environmental balance. Moreover, the unaware consumer is at risk when health-threatening species are used. Thus, species identification acquires fundamental importance in the prevention of phenomena of counterfeiting and adulteration for consumer protection. DNA-based analytical methods are the most applied for species identification due to the resistance of nucleic acid to physical-chemical treatments and degradation, representing a valuable tool for traceability in different types of products (fresh, processed, canned). However, the most appropriate DNA-based technique to be used should be selected according to the species and the kind of product to be analysed. Present DNA-based techniques can rely on sole PCR amplification, producing directly readable results, or methods requiring a post PCR DNA sequencing step, further divided in the classical and mostly used “first generation sequencing technologies” and in the “Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Technologies”, less utilized yet but particularly attractive in the food inspection research field. In this perspective, six research projects, that have been grouped in three technical sections, were reported in this doctoral thesis. In the first section two projects not requiring to the sequencing phase (NO-SEQUENCING TECHNIQUES) are included. In the first project a Pentaplex PCR for the identification of five edible jellyfish species (Nemopilema nomurai, Rhopilema esculentum, Rhizostoma pulmo, Pelagia noctiluca, and Cotylorhiza tuberculata) was developed. A common degenerated forward primer and five specie-specific reverse primers were designed to amplify Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) gene regions of different lengths. Considering the high level of degradation in the DNA extracted from acidified and salted products, the maximum length of the amplicons was set at 200 bp. The assay gave successful amplifications and identification in 85. 4 % of 48 ready-to-eat products and in 60 % of 30 classical salted products collected on the market. In the second project a conventional multiplex PCR for discriminating the toxic species Ruvettus pretiosus and Lepidocybium flavobrunneum (<b>Gemfish),</b> containing high amounts of indigestible wax esters that often provoke gastrointestinal disorders, from other potentially replaced species (tunas, cod, and sablefish) was proposed. A common degenerate forward primer and three species-specific reverse primers were designed to amplify COI gene regions of different lengths of <b>gemfish,</b> tunas, and sablefish, respectively, while a primer pair was designed to amplify a fragment of the cytochrome b (cytb) gene of cod species. The method produced the expected amplicon in all the DNA samples tested (reference and commercial). The second section includes two projects requiring first generation classical Sanger sequencing (1 st GENERATION SEQUENCING TECHNIQUES) : one project evaluated the effects on amplification and sequencing performance of two types of oligonucleotide tails (by Steffens and by Messing) added to PCR primers. The evaluation was carried out in silico and also practically assessed on DNA samples of edible species (birds, fishes, and mammals). While 16 SrRNA tailed and non-tailed primers performed similarly, differences were found for COI primers. Messing’s tails negatively affected the reaction outputs, while Steffens’ tails significantly improved the band intensity and the length of the final contigs based on the individual bidirectional read sequence. In another project DNA and mini-DNA Barcoding was applied for the identification of commercial products sold with the Chinese term 鳕 (cod) in supermarkets and in the online market in China. The mislabelling rate was assessed according to three increasingly stringent definitions (1. cod meaning Gadiformes species; 2. cod meaning Gadus spp.; 3. Cod not meaning any specific species, since the qualifier “Atlantic”, “Pacific” or “Greenland” must be added in order to refer to Gadus morhua, Gadus macrocephalus or Gadus ogac, respectively) due to the lack of harmonization around the denomination “cod” in China. A very high mislabelling rate, which exceeded 60 % even with the less stringent definition, was highlighted. Finally, two project approaching NGS technologies (NGS TECHNIQUES) were conducted: in one of them seafood species commonly utilized in surimi products preparation were chosen as target for the analysis of 14 pairs of universal primers for the 16 SrRNA, cytb and COI mitochondrial genes, in order to assess their potential utilization in NGS analysis. Firstly, an in silico evaluation was conducted in order to test primers coverage capacity on the basis of the number and the position of mismatches within the target sequence available on databases. Then, the 9 primer pairs which showed the best coverage capacity were tested in PCR reaction on the DNA of collected fish and cephalopod species. The primers pair proposed by Chapela et al. (2002) showed the best results in both in silico and PCR analysis. Overall, results confirm that 16 SrRNA primers are the most suitable for the NGS analysis finalized to seafood species detection. In the last project NGS techniques were applied to the analysis of surimi sample sproduced in European and Asian countries. Ion Torrent PGM Platform was used to sequence a short 16 SrRNA fragment with universal primers (designed by Chapela et al., 2002) able in amplifying DNA from both fish and cephalopod species reported as commonly used in surimi production. After the taxonomic analysis of the obtained reads, a certain degree of species variability was observed, especially in Asian products. 37. 5 % of the samples were found as mislabelled. Among them, 25 % voluntary declared a species that actually not corresponded to that found and 25 % not reported at all the presence of molluscs on the label, representing a potential health threat for allergic consumers. Utilization of vulnerable species was also proved. Ion Torrent PGM was proved as an useful tool for the analysis of processed multispecies seafood products, even though the method should be further deepened, particularly regarding the aspect of DNA quantification...|$|E
