Actual models are strongly nonlinear, coupled systems of differential equations. In {{the present paper}} we propose a new model using fuzzy differential equations under strongly generalized differentiability concept. The key point is a continuous fuzzyfication of the signum function. Numerical solutions of the fuzzy differential equations are proposed by using an Euler-type method. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} freepoint <b>tool</b> is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>tool</b> {{designed to}} measure the amount of torque or stretch of a given length of tubing, drill pipe, or casing. The traditional freepoint tool uses either bow springs or magnets to anchor itself inside the pipe. After obtaining {{an estimate of the}} free point by using the pipe stretch estimate technique, the traditional freepoint tool is run in the hole to 1000 feet above the estimated stuck point. The tool is anchored in place. Stretch and or torque is then applied to the pipe. This allows the pipe recovery engineer to obtain a baseline reading of the free pipe. This will give him a starting point to compare his later freepoint readings to. The tool is then run roughly 500 feet past the estimated stuck point. Stretch and torque are applied, and readings are taken. If the tool indicates that the pipe is stuck at that point the tool is pulled uphole and readings are taken again. By applying the bracketing technique, the pipe recovery engineer is quickly able to identify the exact point that the pipe is free.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Spinal {{manipulation}} {{has been}} found to create demonstrable segmental and intersegmental spinal motions thought to be biomechanically related to its mechanisms. In the case of impulsive-type instrument device comparisons, significant differences in the force-time characteristics and concomitant motion responses of spinal manipulative instruments have been reported, but studies investigating the response to multiple thrusts (multiple impulse trains) have not been conducted. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine multi-axial segmental and intersegmental motion responses of ovine lumbar vertebrae to single impulse and multiple impulse spinal manipulative thrusts (SMTs). Methods Fifteen adolescent Merino sheep were examined. Tri-axial accelerometers were attached to intraosseous pins rigidly fixed to the L 1 and L 2 lumbar spinous processes under fluoroscopic guidance while the animals were anesthetized. A <b>hand-held</b> <b>electromechanical</b> chiropractic adjusting instrument (Impulse) was used to apply single and repeated force impulses (13 total over a 2. 5 second time interval) at three different force settings (low, medium, and high) along the posteroanterior axis of the T 12 spinous process. Axial (AX), posteroanterior (PA), and medial-lateral (ML) acceleration responses in adjacent segments (L 1, L 2) were recorded at a rate of 5000 samples per second. Peak-peak segmental accelerations (L 1, L 2) and intersegmental acceleration transfer (L 1 –L 2) for each axis and each force setting were computed from the acceleration-time recordings. The initial acceleration response for a single thrust and the maximum acceleration response observed during the 12 multiple impulse trains were compared using a paired observations t-test (POTT, alpha =. 05). Results Segmental and intersegmental acceleration responses mirrored the peak force magnitude produced by the Impulse Adjusting Instrument. Accelerations were greatest for AX and PA measurement axes. Compared to the initial impulse acceleration response, subsequent multiple SMT impulses were found to produce significantly greater (3 % to 25 %, P Conclusion Knowledge of the vertebral motion responses produced by impulse-type, instrument-based adjusting instruments provide biomechanical benchmarks that support the clinical rationale for patient treatment.

40|$|Hydraulic differential, {{electric}} servo cylinders {{are strongly}} non-linear, coupled multivariable <b>electromechanical</b> <b>tools</b> applicable for driving e. g. manipulators. Besides saturation-type nonlinearities discontinous ones originating from the {{friction between the}} cylinder and the piston and the hydrodynamic properties {{of the flow of}} the working fluid are present in such systems. Though they have considerable advantages in comparison with electric ones in several applications their traditional PID control have to cope with the problem of instabilities and dificulties in finding the proper setting of their feedback gains. These parameters significantly depend on the actual pose of the robot arm and the temperature of the hydraulic oil varying during operation. To widen their applicability both disturbance rejection based, and partial flatness principle based approaches requiring the accurate model of the system and measurement of the disturbances and their time-derivatives were proposed. For getting rid of needing this accurate set of information an adaptive approach working with a hectic learning phase and an acceptable regime of “tuned ” operation was also proposed. In the present paper twoo possible non-linear improvement of this already non-linear control is presented and comaperd to each other. Generally the “learning ” phase is shortened and it becomes less hectic, and trajectory tracking becomes more accurate. The capabilities of the improved control are illustrated via simulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBall screws are {{the most}} common {{elements}} in machine tools for transferring rotational into linear movements. Within an <b>electromechanical</b> machine <b>tool</b> axis, ball screws belong to the decisive components for achieving small positioning errors. Due to wear, the preload of ball screws decreases. This often leads to vibrations in the electromechanical power train and influences the machining results negatively. This results in the need of preload compensation systems, which ensure the required machine accuracy. In this article, an adaptronic approach with piezoelectric self-sensing transducers for an active compensation system of preload control in ball screws is presented and common results of the developed self-sensing actuator are discussed...|$|R

Accelerations were greatest for AX and PA measurement axes. Compared to the initial impulse acceleration response, subsequent multiple SMT impulses were found to produce significantly greater (3 % to 25 %, P < 0. 005) AX, PA and ML segmental and intersegmental acceleration responses. Increases in segmental motion responses were greatest for the low force setting (18 %– 26 %), followed by the medium (5 %– 26 %) and high (3 %– 26 %) settings. Adjacent segment (L 1) motion responses were maximized following the application of several multiple SMT impulses. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the vertebral motion responses produced by impulse-type, instrument-based adjusting instruments provide biomechanical benchmarks that support the clinical rationale for patient treatment.

40|$|Advanced {{laryngeal}} {{cancer is}} often treated by surgical {{removal of the}} larynx (laryngectomy) thus rendering patients unable to produce normal voice and speech. Laryngectomy patients must rely on an alternative means of producing voice and speech, with the most common method being {{the use of an}} electrolarynx (EL). The EL is a small, <b>hand-held,</b> <b>electromechanical</b> device that acoustically excites the vocal tract when held against the neck or at the lips. While the EL provides a serviceable means of communication, the resulting speech has several shortcomings in terms of both intelligibility and speech quality. Previous studies have identified and tried to correct different single selected acoustic properties associated with the abnormal quality of EL speech, but with only limited success. There remains uncertainty about: 1) which components of the EL speech acoustic signal are contributing most to its abnormal quality and 2) what kinds of acoustic enhancements would be most effective in improving the quality of EL speech. Using a combination of listening experiments, acoustic analysis and acoustic modeling, this thesis investigated the perceptual and acoustic impacts of several aberrant properties of EL speech, with the overall goal of using the results to direct future EL speech improvement efforts. Perceptual experiments conducted by having 10 listeners judge the naturalness of differently enhanced versions of EL speech demonstrated that adding pitch information would produce the most benefit. Removing the EL self-noise and correcting for a lack of low frequency energy would also improve EL speech, but to a lesser extent. However,(cont.) this study also demonstrated that monotonous, normal speech was found to be more natural than any version of EL speech, indicating that there are other abnormal properties of EL speech contributing to its unnatural quality. An acoustic analysis of a corpus of pre- and post-laryngectomy speech revealed that changes in vocal tract anatomy produce narrower formant bandwidths and spectral zeros that alter the spectral properties of EL speech. Vocal tract modeling confirmed that these spectral zeros are a function of EL placement and thus their effects will vary from user to user. Even though the addition of pitch information was associated with the greatest improvement in EL speech quality, its implementation is not currently possible because it would require access to underlying linguistic and/or neural processes. Based on these findings it was concluded that an enhancement algorithm that corrects for the low frequency deficit, the interference of the EL self-noise, the narrower formant bandwidths, and the effect of the source location, should produce EL speech whose quality surpasses what is currently available. by Geoffrey Seth Meltzner.

40|$|Abstract: A {{critical}} {{issue to the}} optimization of a micro generator is the electromechanical link between the transducer and power processing circuitry because the performance of each subsystem depends {{on the behavior of}} the other. In order to accurately simulate and optimize a micro generator system, a combined electromechanical simulation is required. In this paper, a PSpice based <b>electromechanical</b> simulation <b>tool</b> kit for energy harvesting inertial micro generators has been developed. The tool kit consists of a generic Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) model coupled to models of Electromagnetic (EM), Electrostatic (ES) and Piezoelectric (PZ) transduction mechanisms. Additional features of the physical systems that affect the overall performance such as end stop dynamics and parasitic damping are also included.

40|$|Background Insufficient {{physical}} activity and physical fitness are associated with cardiovascular diseases and back pain in adults. But cardiovascular risk factors and risk factors for back pain can be detected earlier in life. Aims Therefore, {{the aim of this}} dissertation study was to examine associations between physical fitness, {{physical activity}} behaviour, anthropometrics and retinal vessel diameters, as a risk factor of cardiovascular disease, and spinal flexibility or spinal posture, as risk factors for back pain, in a cohort of Swiss children aged 6 to 8 years. Further, the influence of parental education, household income and nationality on physical fitness, retinal vessel diameters and risk factors for back pain was analysed. Additionally, through the Sportcheck project the physical fitness skills of all first-graders of the canton Basel-Stadt could be classified in order to arrange performance-linked additional physical education lessons. The goal was to increase children’s physical activity, knowing that the motivation is higher when children are having a similar level in physical education classes. Methods Therefore, 1314 children conducted a 20 m shuttle run test, a 20 m sprint, a jumping sidewards and a balancing backwards test. Also height and weight were measured and the body mass index (BMI) calculated. The optional measurements of retinal vessel diameters, using a Static Retinal Vessel Analyzer, were completely conducted in 391 children. Measurements of spinal flexibility and spinal posture, using a <b>hand-held</b> computer-assisted <b>electromechanical</b> device, the MediMouse, were performed in 395 children. Additional proxy-reported questionnaires about physical activity behaviour, parental education, household income and nationality were completed by 340 children. Results It was found that cardiorespiratory fitness and indoor activity had a positive influence on retinal vessel health. Physically fit children had a more flexible spinal inclination and pelvic tilt than their peers. Boys {{with a high level of}} cardiorespiratory fitness had additionally more often a normal spinal posture. Parental education level, household income and migrant background were negatively related to the physical fitness levels and anthropometrics of the schoolchildren. Moreover, children from less educated parents and with a migrant background were spending more time in front of a screen than their peers. By the use of the physical fitness tests 351 (27...|$|R
40|$|The {{commissioning}} of mechatronic systems, {{especially for}} <b>electromechanical</b> axes on <b>tooling</b> and production machines, is often carried out under time and cost pressure. In particular, the controller parameterization is commonly performed by applying basic tuning rules or by carrying out not disclosed design automatisms. As a result, existing capacities and potentials of the drives and controls {{are not fully}} utilized and lead to a lower productivity than would be possible with the optimum adjustment of the control systems. The main {{reason for this is}} the high complexity of the investigated systems, which leads to complex system models (for example with non-linearities) which do not allow the application of classical tuning methods. Because of that, it is advisable to apply alternative methods such as metaheuristics. The main aspect of this thesis is the investigation of the suitability of metaheuristics for the optimization of control systems on electromechanical axes as part of a thorough commissioning methodology. This includes the modeling, the selection of suitable (hybrid) optimization methods, the determination and assessment of evaluation criteria as well as the demonstration of the functional capability of the overall method using selected experiments. The strict modularization in subcomponents allows the rapid exchange of individual parts as well as the application of the systematics for other problems...|$|R
40|$|With wide {{applications}} of power electronic devices in modern power systems, simulation using traditional <b>electromechanical</b> and electromagnetic <b>tools</b> suffers low speed and imprecision. Multi-rate methods can enhance efficiency of simulation by decreasing {{the scale of}} systems in small time-steps. However, the existing traditional methods for multi-rate simulation suffer the problems of instability and simulation errors. These have hindered the application of multi-rate simulation in power industry. Therefore theoretical evaluation on different multi-rate simulation methods is crucial to understand the feasibility and limitation of the methods, and to contribute to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional methods. In this paper, the multi-rate simulation performance based on two traditional technologies and a Modified Thevenin Interface are evaluated to provide an overall feasibility of multi-rate algorithms in the power simulation. The Modified Thevenin Interface is proposed to overcome the drawbacks in synchronization. Three theorems are proposed and proved for theoretically analyzing {{the stability of the}} simulation methods. Error analyses of the multi-rate methods are performed to identify the relationships between errors and simulation conditions. Besides, the accuracy and efficiency performance in a practical project of VSC-MTDC shows the feasibility and necessity by using multi-rate simulation. Through the theoretical analysis, the issues of stability and accuracy of multi-rate simulation for the DC grids have been better understood, based on which an improved simulation algorithm has been proposed to overcome these issues. Long-term system dynamics of large-scale systems containing DC grids and fast transients of HVDC converters can be investigated simultaneously with high speed and sufficient accuracy...|$|R
