All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> Most of the stones were removed to build the low stone wall that runs across the front of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The two gates {{into the}} city, Mdina Gate and Greeks Gate, are {{located within the}} curtain walls of the land front. Remains of the medieval <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> {{as well as the}} 18th-century Torre dello Standardo are located just within the city walls.

5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E
40|$|For {{active control}} {{purposes}} a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure enables {{the measurement of}} a time advanced reference signal for a feedforward system because the reference signal can be measured at the primary panel and the control system {{can be applied to}} the second panel. In aerospace engineering these <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> sections are often filled with absorbent materials. These materials have an influence on the structural dynamics of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section. In order to guarantee the function of the feedforward control system the damped <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section has to show a linear system behavior. In order to analyze the linearity of <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> panels with different absorbent materials this study experimentally investigates different damping concepts on a simple <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure. The <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure is a buildup with two 0. 8 x 0. 6 m² aluminum plates and different damping concepts are applied to the cavity between. The absorbent material is added to the secondary panel where glass wool in different configurations or constraint layer damping is applied. The linear system behavior up to 500 Hz can be verified with the coherence function for all concepts. Above 500 Hz it can be shown that the test set-up has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section...|$|R

5|$|By the 15th century, most of Mdina's enciente had {{a system}} of <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> The land front was flanked by four towers, one near Greeks Gate, another at {{the centre of the}} land front, the Turri Mastra (also known as Turri dila bandiera) near the main {{entrance}} and the Turri di la Camera at the southeast corner of the city. A barbican was built near Mdina's main entrance sometime after 1448. In the 1450s there were fears of a Barbary or Ottoman attack, so efforts were made to improve Mdina's walls. The main ditch was completed, and the Castellu di la Chitati was partially demolished by royal licence in 1453, due to its ruinous state and the excessive cost for its upkeep.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} walls of Mdina were {{gradually}} dismantled between the 1530s and 1720s, when the city's fortifications were being upgraded by the Hospitallers. One {{of the most significant}} visible remnants {{of the medieval}} fortifications is the Greeks Gate and the surrounding curtain walls, which still retains its medieval form apart from the outer portal which was built in the 18th century. Parts of the <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> including the remains of two gun loops, still stand between the gate and the Torre dello Standardo. Most of the northern and eastern walls date back to the medieval period, although some sections were rebuilt by the Hospitallers. The northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower, while the remains of Byzantine antemurals and the foundations of a late 15th-century artillery platform have been found in the eastern walls.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Ashot III, Ani became the capital of Armenia. It was a {{naturally}} protected city, built on a triangular plateau, its only vulnerable part being the north. In {{order to protect the}} future capital of Armenia and its inhabitants, the king built defenses across the narrowest point of the site. However, upon being declared capital of the kingdom, the city expanded quickly. Consequently, a line of massive <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> were built further to the north during {{the reign of}} King Smbat II. These northern walls are the most impressive part of Ani. The rest of the city was also well protected by fortifications and towers.|$|E

500|$|The Klis Fortress rises on a bare cliff {{divided into}} two parts. The first, lower part is on the west, out topped by Mount Greben from the north. The second, higher part is on the east, and {{includes}} the Tower [...] "Oprah", whose name most likely refers to a specific part in the defense. In this section which was not topped by any side, was located the flat of the Commander. The only entrance into the fortress is from the western side. On the southwest side of the fortress, and below it was a resort (part of the modern village of Klis) called [...] "borgo" [...] or [...] "suburbium", surrounded by <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> with 100–200 towers. A similar but smaller resort (also part of modern village of Klis) existed below Mount Greben on a plateau called Megdan.

500|$|At Cubzac, on {{the high}} rocky {{shoreline}} overlooking the Dordogne, and in the town centre, are {{the ruins of the}} castle [...] "des Quatre fils Aymon" [...] within ordinary houses. The entrance of the fortress is flanked by the remains of two towers. These few stones are however extraordinarily rich in history and legend. First off, the castle did not belong to the four sons of Aymon who lived, perhaps, the time of Charlemagne. It was built and rebuilt in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was the seat of the lordship of Cubzaguais. In 1206, John Lackland, the king of England and youngest son of Eleanor of Aquitaine, took revenge of the king of France Philippe Auguste, who accused him of treason and deprived him of his fiefs, by engaging in miscellaneous abuses. He stormed the castle of Cubzac, and destroyed it. It is a brief English victory. The lordship returns to the French, and is attributed to Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, son of the terrible and bloody winner of the Albigensian Crusade. He built a new castle deemed impregnable, on behalf of the King of England, with <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> and yet it is the one for which ruins remain. He was sacked by the Gascon barons revolted against Simon de Montfort. Half sacked, it served as a stately home, until moving to the lordship Bouih. [...] The legions days that the two mediaeval castles have erected on the site of a building dating from the Carolingian period, which nothing remains. The Four Sons of Amon castle was registered as a historic monument in 1938.|$|E

These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Earth was banked {{between the}} two walls to take the impact of cannon fire and {{this meant that the}} {{destructive}} effect of a cannon being fired at point blank range {{at the base of the}} main wall could be avoided. Secondary walls often have round towers set into them to fire on attackers entering the ‘dead’ areas between the walls. Outside the secondary wall there would be a wide moat or ditch and sometimes there would be a further low wall surrounding the moat. [...] In Austria these double circuits are shown on early prints of St Pölten, Krems. Enns, Freistadt, St Veit an Glan, Bruck an der Leitha, Tulln and Vienna. Merian's print of Villach provides a good illustration of multiple walls.

2500|$|This Canton Viaduct is {{the first}} and {{possibly}} only viaduct to use both a blind arcade and cavity wall structure. [...] The structure {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "multiple arch bridge", but it does not fit the classic definition of spanning a distance between two points. [...] Although the deck arches appear to extend through to other side, they do not; each deck arch is only four feet deep. [...] The deck arches support the spandrels, deck (beyond the walls), coping and parapets; they are not tied to the longitudinal walls. [...] The only arches that extend through to the other side are six river portals and two roadway portals. [...] The 'buttresses' are also unique in that they extend through to the other side, so they are actually transverse walls. [...] Due to its use of <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> and lack of open arches, the Canton Viaduct is more accurately described as a blind arcade cavity wall. [...] The Thomas Viaduct (Maryland, 1835) and Starrucca Viaduct (Pennsylvania, 1847) are classic examples of multiple arch viaducts, as their primary support system consists of open semi-circular arches spanning the distance between piers, without any walls.|$|E

40|$|The Double-Wall, "Whipple" Shield [1] {{has been}} the subject of many {{hypervelocity}} impact studies and has proven to be an effective shield system for Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) impacts for spacecraft. The US modules of the International Space Station (ISS), with their "bumper shields" offset from their pressure holding rear walls provide good examples of effective on-orbit use of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield. The concentric cylinder shield configuration with its large radius of curvature relative to separation distance is easily and effectively represented for testing and analysis as a system of two parallel plates. The parallel plate <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> configuration has been heavily tested and characterized for shield performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. The <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield and principally similar Stuffed Whipple Shield are very common shield types for MMOD protection. However, in some locations with many spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall. As represented in Figure 1, there is an included angle between the two walls. And, with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective included angle constantly changes. This complicates assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls when using software tools such as NASA's BumperII. In addition, the validity of the risk assessment comes into question when using the standard <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield equations, especially since verification testing of every set of <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> included angles is impossible...|$|R

40|$|Exhaust {{emission}} standards are governmentally controlled standards, which are increasingly stringent, forcing alternate strategies {{to meet these}} standards. One approach to improve {{the efficiency of the}} exhaust emission equipment is to decrease the time required to get the catalytic converter to optimum operating temperature. To accomplish this, automotive manufacturers are using <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> stainless steel exhaust manifolds to reduce heat loss of the exhaust gases to the converter. The current method to manufacture <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> stainless steel exhaust components is to use a low-cost alloy with good forming properties and extensively form, cut, assemble, and weld the pieces. Superplastic forming (SPF) technology along with alloy improvements has potential at making this process more cost effective. Lockheed Martin Energy Systems (LMES), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and USCAR Low Emission Partnership (LEP) worked under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement (CRADA) to evaluate material properties, SPF behavior, and welding behavior of duplex stainless steel alloy for automotive component manufacturing. Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has a separate CRADA with the LEP to use SPF technology to manufacture a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> stainless steel exhaust component.
