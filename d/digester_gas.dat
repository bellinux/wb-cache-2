40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the process design and {{performance}} of an innovative plant for <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> upgrading to synthetic natural gas (SNG). The differences and advantages over traditional upgrading processes are discussed. The main strength of <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> upgrading via high-temperature electrolysis concerns its higher synthetic natural gas productivity for a given raw <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> feed. Electrolysis is performed through a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) system, which is fed with demineralized water and purified <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> (made up of methane and carbon dioxide). Surplus electricity from intermittent renewable energy sources is used to supply the energy required for the SOEC stacks. The resulting methane-rich syngas is reacted {{in a series of}} methanators to yield a high CH 4 content output stream. The steam reforming reaction is promoted by means of a nickel catalyst in the cathode (fuel) electrode, which reduces the methane fraction: hence, sulfur, which is present in several types of <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> (e. g., from sewage or landfills) in the form of hydrogen sulfide, has been identified as a possible inhibitor for this reaction. However, it is also well-known that sulfur is responsible for the deterioration of the electrochemical performance of a stack. Therefore, its effect on the system has been modeled for different thermodynamic conditions. This study analyses the electrochemical and energy performance of the integrated process through which all the carbon contained in <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> is converted/upgraded to methane-rich gas. The electrochemical dissociation of the CO 2 contained in the <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> to CH 4 (with the addition of external demineralized water) is one way of cleverly exploiting the carbon content in <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> when poor quality or limited biological substrates are available for anaerobic digestion.

40|$|Abstract:- In today’s {{global power}} {{scenario}} Distributed Generation (DG) is playing an important role. DG {{can be obtained}} from many sources such as wind energy, tidal energy, solar energy, landfill and <b>digester</b> <b>gases</b> etc. In recent DG technologies microturbine generation is proven {{to be one of the}} simpler and environment friendly DG systems. DG systems are usually stand alone or they are interconnected to low and or medium voltage grid system. With increasing penetration of DG, it is necessary to analyse its performance and its impact on existing system. Modelling and simulation of DG systems helps in analysing their performance and impact on existing power distribution system. In this paper, a model of a micro- turbine generator system is developed in MATLLAB/Simulink using SimPowerSystems library. The simulink model is built from the mathematical model of each part of system with their interconnections. This simplified model is a useful tool for studying the various operational aspects of micro turbines. The performance of developed model is studied by connecting it to an isolated load. The interconnection of a microturbine generator to a load or distribution system is a critical part and it requires efficient power conditioning system. In this paper, AC/DC/AC power converter is used. Semiconductor power electronics devices such as rectifiers and inverters produce harmonics in the system. The harmonics injected by the microturbine generation system are reduced by using passive filter. The simulations of the microturbine generation system are carried out for resistive as well as inductive load. The output waveforms are presented in the paper...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Most {{estimates}} of carbonaceous gas emissions from manure treatment lagoons {{are based on}} biogas production from anaerobic <b>digesters,</b> <b>gases</b> collected over covered lagoons, or the CH 4 production potential of animal waste. More data from direct measurements are necessary for evaluating mitigation strategies. Researchers at Oklahoma State University have successfully operated a pilot-scale bioreactor consisting of four 270 L columns that recreate environmental conditions found in anaerobic lagoons as indicated by color, temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC). The columns were loaded at a surface organic loading rate similar to lagoons treating manure from commercial swine farms {{in the state of}} Oklahoma (935 kg VS/ha-day). The simulated mid-to-late summer CH 4 emission rate was determined to range between 200 and 300 kg/ha-day, and the CO 2 emission rate ranged between 380 and 580 kg/ha-day. Approximately 65 % of the total carbon applied {{to the surface of the}} lagoon simulator was recovered as CH 4 and CO 2 gases; however, lagoon methane production was greater than expected using chemical oxygen demand (COD) as a predictive standard. The daily patterns of gaseous emissions and volatile organic acid concentrations in the liquid suggest that CH 4 production takes place across the entire depth of the reactor. Easily digestible organic matter is converted in the upper layers; more slowly digested material settles and is converted at the sludge layer. Data on day versus night emissions show that biogas had a higher proportion of CO 2 during the day than during the night...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the response of}} pineapple mill waste to anaerobic digestion, a simulated mill waste with a COD value equal to actual mill waste was made from commercial pineapple juice for this study. Ammonium hydroxide {{was used as a}} pH control and a nitrogen supplement. The study utilized batch-anaerobic digesters in initial stages to find optimum conditions for long-term studies which were conducted in 9 -liter bottles with periodic removal of digested waste and addition of fresh waste. Seed was composed of digested domestic sewage sludge, bottom sediment from a canal used for disposal of pineapple mill waste, and fermented pineapples and pineapple juice. Principal studies involved three digesters maintained at ambient temperature as controls, two digesters with 75 mg/l of phosphorus added, two digesters heated to 90 °F, and one digester whose contents were mixed by recirculation of <b>digester</b> <b>gases.</b> The <b>digesters</b> were operated for sixty days. Analytical parameters were COD, sugar, pH, ORP, volatile acids, gas production, gas composition, alkalinity, and total bacteria by the Breed Counting Method. The results of the study showed that pineapple mill waste undergoes a rapid initial decomposition. A reduction in COD occurred along with a rapid drop in sugar concentration and subsequent formation of volatile acids. Following initial activity, there is a period of inactivity after which recovery from the acid stage occurs and a steady reduction of waste material begins. The test data collected indicated that raw pineapple waste liquor is unsuitable for anaerobic digestion unless it is heated, stirred, or treated with phosphate. After sixty days of operation, digesters at ambient temperature, those with added phosphorus, and those that were stirred produced a COD reduction of 40, 51, and 53 percent, respectively. There was strong evidence that pineapple mill waste may be satisfactorily treated anaerobically if it is heated and optimum conditions exist. Digesters operated at 90 °F effected 66 percent reduction in COD with a steady production of gas containing at least 75 percent CH 4. U. S.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. It is {{estimated}} that California???s dairies {{have the potential to}} produce an estimates 40 million cubic feet of biogas per day, representing a potential capacity of about 140 mW of energy. Due to the distributed nature of these resources, reciprocating engines coupled to generators are a common means of extracting power from the <b>digester</b> <b>gases.</b> One of the most significant challenges facing the combustion digester biogas is high NOx emissions. To address this challenge, an integrated pollution capture and microwave system has been developed to reduce NOx emissions from biogas engines. The feasibility of reburning the captured NOx was assessed and the various operating parameters, including temperature, pressure and reactants composition were determined using chemical equilibration, kinetic modeling and a Computerized Fluid Dynamic simulation using ANSYS FLUENT software. The NOx removal system is a pair of alternating carbon adsorption vessels installed on the engine exhaust pipe. The carbon will capture cooled exhaust gas NOx and is expected to pass through cleaned exhaust having NOx levels in the range of 1 - 5 ppm. Each carbon adsorber is equipped with a microwave generator that desorbs the NOx and regenerates the carbon in place when it is isolated from the engine exhaust. Desorbed NOx is collected in a concentrated small volume sweep gas and reacted in a separate microwave activated reactor with consumable carbon to produce CO 2 and N 2. This system is currently being demonstrated at a dairy facility in Northern California. While the amount and cost of the carbon consumed during the microwave activated NOx reduction step is small, it would be desirable to eliminate this step with another means of NOx destruction. One potential alternative is to use the engine to destroy NOx by dissociation at high temperatures. Traditionally, NOx is formed in the engine by the thermal or prompt mechanisms. However, high concentrations of NOx in the sweep gas would approach equilibrium from the other direction (high concentration to low) and could yield a net NOx reduction. Since the carbon absorber can accept high concentrations of NOx, the absorbers could be used in a potentially sustainable process where NOx is continuously accumulated and destroyed. The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of this alternate method of NOx destruction using chemical equilibrium, kinetics and computerized fluid dynamic simulations.

California, like many other states, is requiring a reduction in emissions from primary sources of electricity generation.

The current energy policy in California specifically promotes the use of renewable and carbon neutral fuels such as <b>digester</b> <b>gas.</b> The future generations of burners must be fuel flexible {{in order to meet}} these emission laws while providing continual operation. To address this, {{a variable}} geometry low-swirl injector was developed and its emissions and stability performance assessed using a variety of diagnostics.

One key result from the optical probe is that the recorded radiation emitted by the reaction corresponding to the lean blow off limits of any composition of <b>digester</b> <b>gas</b> remains constant, implying it could serve as a robust stability sensor with minimal signal processing. Evaluating the role of the variable geometry found that (1) variable center blockage in a low-swirl injector has no effect on the lean blow off limits, (2) as the center blockage becomes less restrictive the NOx emissions will increase, and (3) incorporation of a quarl expansion rather than a sudden expansion increased the lean blow off limits and gave a 50 % reduction in NOx emissions.
