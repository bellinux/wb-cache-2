5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war.

US propaganda focused on fighting <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two.

The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight <b>for</b> <b>freedom.</b>|$|E

Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire <b>for</b> <b>freedom.</b>|$|E
