5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun. Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food was available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary {{to take their}} older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> de Rivesaltes, <b>the</b> German prisoners worked {{extensively}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{reconstruction of}} Pyrénées-Orientales, but between May 1945 and 1946, 412 German {{prisoners of war}} died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the reports, {{the age of}} {{the detainees}} ranged from 8 to 80. At least 17 people were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> <b>The</b> {{conditions}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were generally poor: people had to sleep on <b>the</b> concrete floor <b>in</b> November on their first day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> but were later given a blanket. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first 10 days, they received only two meals a day, mostly tea and bread with cheese. There were also no toilets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farm, so the detainees had to relieve themselves on the floor. After 10 days, latrines were finally added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> After five days, they were given water to wash themselves.|$|R
25|$|Conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were brutal. Many prisoners died in typhus {{epidemics}} {{that swept}} <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1942 {{and again in}} 1944. Those whom the SS guards judged too weak or sick to work were gassed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp's</b> small gas chamber. Gassing with Zyklon B began in June 1944. Camp doctors also killed sick or injured prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infirmary with lethal injections. More than 85,000 people died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{retreating}} Muslim {{army was}} met by the ferocious Arab women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents and armed with tent poles charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud that then had been directed against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, the Germans {{estimated}} at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews. That same month, Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never happen. On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Some were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to the camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E
5|$|In July 1801, First Consul Bonaparte {{appointed}} d'Hautpoul as inspector-general of {{the cavalry}} and then awarded him {{command of the}} cavalry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> of Compiègne and Saint-Omer. In August 1805, d'Hautpoul was given command of the 2nd division of cuirassiers under Joachim Murat. At Austerlitz, d'Hautpoul distinguished himself by leading his heavy cavalry into the Russian center at the Pratzen heights, breaking the infantry squares. In 1804, Napoleon made him a grand officer (grand cordon) of the Légion d'honneur and a senator, which carried with it an annual income of 20,000 francs.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> {{was troubled}} during its {{existence}} {{and there were}} allegations that {{women and children were}} being subject to rape and beatings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> and that many of the children were simply disappearing.

5000|$|Frýd {{completed}} his most successful novel <b>in</b> 1956. <b>The</b> plot is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last months of 1944, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fictional concentration <b>camp</b> of Gigling. <b>The</b> main character, the young intellectual Zdeněk Roubík, {{is an assistant}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> office. One of his jobs is to maintain the card index of the inmates, hence {{the title of the}} novel, [...] "A Box of Lives". <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> Roubík gradually manages to overcome the apathy and depression caused by the death of his brother and he becomes more actively involved <b>in</b> <b>camp</b> life. <b>The</b> author attempts to depict everyday life, social interactions and relationships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> and <b>the</b> work and hardships of the inmates. The description of <b>the</b> SS guards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> is a focus of particular attention.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 {{allowed for the}} incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
5|$|A decree in April 1919 {{resulted}} {{in the establishment of}} concentration camps, which were entrusted to the Cheka, later administered by a new government agency, Gulag. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> were used as slave labour. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists of those to be dealt with in this manner. In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques.|$|E
50|$|After {{suffering}} at {{the hands}} of terrorists, when Japan invaded China he was interned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chefoo <b>Camp,</b> with his wife Eileen (born 9 January 1902, an artist and a musician with the Chefoo School group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp),</b> and children (Theodore, born 30 August 1928, and Peter, born 2 November 1930). Others have commented on Bazire's presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
50|$|Accurate {{counting}} of {{the number}} of refugees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> stopped during March 2013 due to the high influx of refugees that skyrocketed that month. Current estimates put the number of refugees residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> at about 79,900 (August 23, 2015 estimate).|$|R
50|$|Schwitters was well-liked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and was {{a welcome}} {{distraction}} from the internment they were suffering. Fellow internees would later recall fondly his curious habits of sleeping under his bed and barking like a dog, {{as well as his}} regular Dadaist readings and performances. However, the epileptic condition which had not surfaced since his childhood began to recur whilst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> His son attributed this to Schwitters’ depression at internment which he kept hidden from others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in Zaire was {{the dismantling of the}} refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|Following a footballing career spent {{exclusively}} with Torpedo, Streltsov, {{a supporter of}} Spartak Moscow, repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team. After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team {{before returning to the}} youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served to him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.|$|E

50|$|Conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were deteriorating at {{this point}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, and disease was a serious problem. De Porcaro {{contracted}} typhus in February (almost certainly from ministering to sick Frenchmen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp),</b> and ultimately died of the disease on 12 March 1945, just over a month before <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> was liberated by the American army.|$|R
50|$|The South Korean {{journalist}} Kang Chol-hwan is {{a former}} prisoner of Yodok Political Prison Camp and has written a book, The Aquariums of Pyongyang, about his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> <b>The</b> South Korean human rights activist Shin Dong-hyuk {{is the only person}} known to have escaped from Kaechon Political Prison Camp. He gave an account of his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning {{a war to}} remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Uganda, the Rwandan government supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting, and controlling the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile, and the country was renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998, and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This war lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.|$|E
5|$|With the {{censorship}} of Polish theater (and the virtual {{end of the}} Polish radio and film industry), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Kraków, with shows presented in various underground venues. Beginning in 1940 the theaters were coordinated by the Secret Theatrical Council. Four large companies and more than 40smaller groups were active throughout the war, even in the Gestapo's Pawiak prison in Warsaw and in Auschwitz; underground acting schools were also created. Underground actors, many of whom officially worked mundane jobs, included Karol Adwentowicz, Elżbieta Barszczewska, Henryk Borowski, Wojciech Brydziński, Władysław Hańcza, Stefan Jaracz, Tadeusz Kantor, Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, Bohdan Korzeniowski, Jan Kreczmar, Adam Mularczyk, Andrzej Pronaszko, Leon Schiller, Arnold Szyfman, Stanisława Umińska, Edmund Wierciński, Maria Wiercińska, Karol Wojtyła (who later became Pope John Paul II), Marian Wyrzykowski, Jerzy Zawieyski and others. Theater was also active in the Jewish ghettos and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> for Polish war prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|Soon <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> was overcrowded {{and more}} camps {{were set up}} {{in other parts of}} the country. Initially, Armenians and Palestinians cohabited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> <b>The</b> Armenian {{inhabitants}} later left.|$|R
50|$|Beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{autumn of}} 1920 during Polish-Soviet war, {{thousands}} of captured Red Army men were placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> of Тuchola. These {{prisoners of war}} (POWs) lived in crude dugouts, and hunger, cold, and infectious diseases killed many. According to historians Zbigniew Karpus and Waldemar Rezmer, up to 2000 prisoners died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> before it was closed in 1923. However, according to other sources the number of died prisoners was much higher. Colonel Ignacy Matuszewski reported that about 22 thousand Red Army men died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> of Tuchola.|$|R

25|$|UNBRO also {{supervised}} {{the provision of}} water in the border camps, few of which had access to natural sources of potable water. Each week trucks supplied by the Thai government transported 650,000 liters of chlorinated water to storage tanks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> In addition, UNBRO supplied building materials to refugees and implemented an agricultural program to produce fresh vegetables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were interrogations {{and torture}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> Suspected Tamil Tigers {{were taken to}} other {{facilities}} where they faced further abuse.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> 1937, <b>the</b> Nazis {{constructed}} <b>the</b> Buchenwald concentration <b>camp,</b> near Weimar, Germany. The motto Jedem das Seine {{was placed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp's</b> main entrance gate. The gates {{were designed by}} Franz Ehrlich, {{a former student of}} the Bauhaus art school, who had been imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> because he was a communist.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> living {{conditions}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> were extremely poor, it brought infection and illness and, consequently, plagues that killed {{a large number}} of <b>the</b> people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> They were buried on a valley nearby that used to be a burial place of Jews hundreds of years ago.|$|R
