25|$|The I/O ports {{were changed}} with the early 2009 revision. A fifth USB 2.0 port was added and the FireWire 400 port was {{replaced}} with a FireWire 800 port. The AirPort card was upgraded to 802.11a/b/g/draft-n and later to 802.11a/b/g/n. Bluetooth was also upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1. Instead of a single full-size DVI port, a Mini-DVI port was added along with a Mini DisplayPort connection, which allows <b>dual</b> <b>display</b> support. Unlike the DVI port, the Mini DisplayPort supports external displays with a resolution up to 2560×1600, which allows use of the 30-inch Cinema Display with the Mac Mini. As of this revision, the Apple Remote is no longer included with the Mac Mini.|$|E

50|$|Several {{versions}} of the APQ-159 were built over its lifetime. It was initially offered in four separate models with the same radar electronics, but different displays. The APQ-159-1 and -2 models used a display that could operate in television mode to operate the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, while the -3 and -4 lacked this capability. The -1 and -3 models had a single display, while the -2 and -4's had <b>dual</b> <b>displays</b> {{for use in the}} two seater F-5F. The APQ-159-5 version was a product improvement that further improved reliability and reduced weight to the same as the original APQ-153, making in-field upgrades much simpler. The final version was the APQ-159-7.|$|R
50|$|The enV3's {{camera is}} a 3.0-megapixel camera {{which allows the}} user to take {{pictures}} in six different resolutions, five white balance presets and with five different color effects. There are also four special shot modes: Smile shot, which automatically takes a picture when a person smiles; Panorama, which stitches together three photos shot from left to right; Intelligent shot, which automatically adjusts the white balance and color saturation based on the environment; and <b>Dual</b> <b>Display</b> mode, which activates the external display, allowing self-portraits.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our current {{research in the}} field of interactive large public displays with mobile device interaction. The core of our research is based on a user interface concept that takes advantage of input and output capabilities of interactive large public displays and mobile devices. We call this concept the "dual display" concept, which allows us to execute multimedia user interfaces across both large and small display types. By shifting parts of a user interface down to a personal mobile device we argue that we can solve a number of problems originating from limitations in large display real estate. As a result of our research we have defined a number of design strategies focusing on the concepts of interactive <b>dual</b> <b>displays.</b> We also report on applying these design strategies to our development of large display applications, which we deployed and tested in lab environments as well as in public settings...|$|R
