Soon, a back to normal Lisa tells Bart that they can't be in despair about certain issues and should <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> Bart decides to take Lisa's advice, and leaves after buying a bouquet of roses, and apologizes to Jenny for lying to her about his true character and Milhouse for his neglect to visit him.|$|E

Later, he commented, [...] "Overall, the feeling was, 'What the heck, the album doesn't belong to us anyway. [...] Let's <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> and forget it'".

500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on.</b> A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E

50|$|The basic step is for {{the leader}} to touch their left foot behind them, but not to shift their weight, on counts 1 and 2, while the {{follower}} mirrors the motion by touching their right {{foot in front of}} them without shifting weight. On counts 3 and 4, both partners bring their feet back to a standing position, but shift their weight onto the foot they have <b>just</b> <b>moved.</b> <b>On</b> counts 5 and 6, the leader touches their right foot in front of themselves while the follower touches their left foot back. On 7 and 8, both feet are brought back to the standing position where the necessary weight shift occurs to allow the basic step to repeat.|$|R
500|$|Mona's visual {{actress in}} Max Payne 2 was Kathy Tong, a Hollywood model. [...] According {{to the first}} two games' writer Sam Lake, he [...] "did want to switch to Mona [...] but it was problematic. In the end, Max frames those {{sequences}} with his narration, saying that he doesn’t know exactly what happened, or what Mona did, {{but it must have}} been something like this. In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival at the end of Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story. We toyed with figuring out some way, or doing something clever, and then [...] 'No, no, <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> from that bit of the story.' It really didn't work because there was no way of knowing the choices someone made." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, [...] "It's not a big deal. I'll <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> to the next level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he has been out of football ever since.|$|E

These were the thoughts that engaged me when I learnt that Frank Simoes had died on Sunday. Early on in his career he had established himself as the finest copywriter of his era; won every accolade, climbed every mountain, conquered every vista. He could have covered himself with the laurels of the past, coasted along on his early victories, going on doing the same things endlessly. But no, he realised he had nothing left to prove. No territories to protect. No ego to defend. He didn't strut, neither did he swagger, nor blow his own trumpet. He <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on.</b> Abdicating his throne to the multitudes of the mediocre. Who strutted, who swaggered, who blew their own trumpets. Ah, the insecurity of the mediocre, and the largesse of genius.|$|R
2500|$|Dan takes a stern {{approach}} to medicine. He {{spent six years}} at medical school to become a [...] "high-flying consultant". Billed as a [...] "brilliant surgeon", he isn't good at patient management.

6000|$|... 'Sometimes I cannot help {{wishing that}} I could say all this, but not often. There is One who understands, and in really great trials even, {{it is well}} to lean only on Him. But I must write freely. You will not think me moody and downhearted, because I show you that I do miss you, and often feel lonely and shut up in myself. This is exactly what I experience, and I think if I was ill, as you often are, I should break down under it; but God is very merciful to me in keeping me in very good health, so that I am always {{actively}} engaged every day, and when night comes I am weary in body, and sleep sound almost always, so that the time passes very rapidly indeed, and I am living {{in a kind of}} dream, hardly realizing the fact of my being at half the world's distance from you, but borne on from day to day, I scarcely know how. Indeed, when I do look back upon the past six months, I have abundant cause to be thankful. I never perhaps shall know fully how it is, but somehow, as a matter of fact, I am on the whole cheerful, and always busy and calm in mind. I don't have tumultuous bursts of feeling and overwhelming floods of recollection that sweep right away all composure. Your first letters upset me more than once as I re-read them, but I think of you all habitually with real joy and peace of mind. And I am really happy, not in the sense that happiness presents itself always, or exactly in the way that I used to feel it when with you all, or as I should feel it if I were walking up to the lodge with my whole heart swelling within me. It is much more quiet and subdued, and does not perhaps come and go quite as much; but yet in the midst of all, I half doubt sometimes whether everything about and within me is real. I <b>just</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> like a man in a dream, but this again does not make me idle. I don't suppose I ever worked harder, on the whole, than I do now, and I have much anxious work at the Hospital. Such cases, Fan! Only two hours ago, I left a poor sailor, by whose side I had been kneeling near three-quarters of an hour, holding his sinking head and moistening his mouth with wine, the dews of death on his forehead, and his poor emaciated frame heaving like one great pulse at each breath. For four days that he has been there (brought in a dying state from the Merchantman) I have been with him, and yesterday I administered to him the Holy Communion. He had spoken earnestly of his real desire to testify the sincerity of his repentance and faith and love. I have been there daily for nine days, but I cannot always manage it, as it is nearly two miles off. The responsibility is great of dealing with such cases, but I trust that God will pardon all my sad mistakes. I cannot withhold the Bread of Life when I see indications of real sorrow for sin, and the simple readiness to obey the command of Christ, even though there is great ignorance and but little time to train a soul for heaven. I cannot, as you may suppose, prepare for my Sunday work as I ought to do, from want of time. Last Sunday I had three whole services, besides reading the Communion Service and preaching at 11 A.M., and reading Prayers at 5 P.M. I should have preached five times but that I left my sermon at Mr. T.'s, thinking to go back for it.... Mrs. K. gave me an old [...] "Woolmer" [...] the other day, which gladdened my eyes. Little bits of comfort come in, you see, in these ways. Nothing can be kinder than the people here, I mean in Auckland and its neighbourhood--real, simple, hearty kindness. Perhaps the work at Kohimarama is most irksome to me. It is no joke to keep sailors in good humour ashore, and I fear that our presence on board was much needed during the passage out.' ...|$|E

He begs her forgiveness for never making more of his life, never leaving his job at the pier, and for not giving her a better life she so richly deserved. However she answers that she loved the fairground and their life on the pier, and the only thing she regretted was them not being able to have any children. He replies that all he would've changed is to have had even more time together with her, for it not to have been cut short like it was by her early death.|$|R
5000|$|A {{scenario}} {{created in}} the UCD process is a fictional story about the [...] "daily life of" [...] or a sequence of events with the primary stakeholder group as the main character.

50|$|Most {{data sets}} {{will not have}} a perfect scale factor; you will {{probably}} always get some error introduced by the scaling process. However it certainly may be possible to pick a better scaling factor. For one thing, note that dividing a number by a power of two is the same as shifting all the bits to the right once for each power of two. (It's the same thing in decimal, when you divide by 10, you shift all the decimal digits one place to the right, when you divide by 100, you shift them all two places to the right). The pattern of bits doesn't change, it <b>just</b> <b>moves.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, when you divide by a number that is NOT an integer power of 2, you are changing the bit pattern. This is likely to produce a bit pattern with even more bits {{to the right of the}} binary point, artificially introducing required precision. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to use a scale factor that is a power of two. You may still lose bits that get shifted right off the end of the field, but at least you won't be introducing new bits that will be shifted off the end.|$|R
