5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an observer than a direct participant.|$|E
25|$|Common Fell at 1,811 feet (552m) is only 3 feet (1m) {{lower than}} Swineside Knott, but is more {{centrally}} {{placed on the}} ridge and so <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> its natural summit. It consists {{of a number of}} rounded grassy mounds. A small cairn has been built on the highest one, but a remarkable glacial erratic boulder is perched on one of the other mounds. Common Fell gives good views to the north and east.|$|E

500|$|The Hollywood Reporter {{posted a}} {{positive}} review of , saying the film [...] "nails it". Variety {{reports that the}} film [...] "finally <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the blockbuster this top-earning franchise deserves". One review stated the film was the best in The Twilight Saga so far, acknowledging that, [...] "The person who should be worried is Bill Condon, the director tapped for the two-part finale, [...] He's got a real challenge to make movies as good as Eclipse." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised David Slade's ability to make an entertaining film, calling it funny and better than its predecessors, but pointed out the acting hasn't improved much.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 2007, Morrissey {{was given}} an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for {{contributions}} to performing arts. In the same year, he made his feature debut directing Don't Worry About Me, a film about a London boy {{falling in love with}} a Liverpool girl. The film was shot on a budget of £100,000 on location in Liverpool in September and October 2007 and had its world premiere at the 2009 London Film Festival. Joseph Galliano wrote in The Times that Don't Worry About Me is [...] "a very understated film and <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> European Art Cinema." [...] The film was broadcast on BBC Two on 7 March 2010 and released on DVD the next day.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the good old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E

500|$|According to O'Neill, {{the film}} is an [...] "intersection of fact and hallucination". It is set inside the {{decaying}} halls of the closed Ambassador Hotel, former home to the Cocoanut Grove restaurant and the first Academy Awards ceremonies. The film superimposes reenactments of classic Hollywood films onto shots of the dilapidated establishment, with ghostly gangsters and their gun molls interacting with icy blondes and wisecracking bartenders in carefully deconstructed snatches of dialogue. O'Neill's time-lapse photography lends the film an ethereal effect that serves an intentionally distancing purpose. In this study of the historic Hollywood edifice, there is no discernible plot {{and there are no}} recurring characters. The film construction has the appearance of snippets taken from lost films of the 1940s; it uses surreal vignettes of nude men and women, stop-motion animated mannequin torsos, flickering film projections and dim light bulbs to create what devolves in a sense of nightmares, giving a result that <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an art installation than the expected film.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most {{anthropomorphic}} cars, {{the eyes}} of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, and the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at {{the front end of the}} car <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E

[...] Tiny Mix Tapes critic Jakob Dorof {{stated that the}} hook is [...] "awful" [...] and sounds like [...] "If I Were a Boy". Dorof continued, [...] "It’s touching, in a Backstreet Boys meets [...] "Forever Young" [...] kind of way". He criticized Eminem for his rapping lyrics [...] "so long as he keeps rapping as fast and shoutingly {{as he has been}} on every last verse he’s released {{in the past couple of}} years". Consequence of Sound's reviewer Winston Robbins gave a rather negative review on [...] "Lighters". Robbins believes that Mars' vocal delivery in the chorus does not fit into a rap song and would have done better on a solo record or with another artist, [...] "it is so far from home next to the hard verses of two of rap’s bad boys." [...] David Amidon from music website PopMatters said that [...] "Lighters" [...] was the only disappointing recording of the 11 tracks on the EP deluxe edition and [...] "it’s easy to press the skip button if you’d like to."

[...] A reporter from the American edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "We can't honestly remember the last time Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video" [...] and deemed it as the best video from Femme Fatale. Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the [...] "fun story". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is [...] "probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era." [...] Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, [...] " [...] is actually rather compelling and <b>feels</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video." [...] A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that [...] " [...] point to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously." [...] The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is [...] "entertaining [...] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) femme fatale." ...|$|E
