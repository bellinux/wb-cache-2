5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, {{the objects of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region {{is less than the}} distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of coherent structures in turbulence is a signature of a developing cascade and therefore might be observable by analyzing <b>inner</b> heliospheric <b>solar</b> wind turbulence. To test this idea, {{data from the}} Helios 2 mission, for six streams of solar wind at different heliocentric distances and of different velocities, were subjected to statistical analysis using the partial variance of increments (PVI) approach. We see a clear increase of the PVI distribution function versus solar wind age for higher PVI cutoff, indicating development of non-Gaussian coherent structures. The plausibility of this interpretation is confirmed by a similar behavior observed in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulation data at corresponding dimensionless nonlinear times. © 2012.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the inner planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E
5000|$|In {{stars with}} masses of 0.3-1.5 solar masses (...) , {{including}} the Sun, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton-proton chains, {{which do not}} establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the <b>inner</b> portion of <b>solar</b> mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.|$|R
25|$|Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, {{which has}} a {{relatively}} reflective surface, is normally {{visible to the naked}} eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be {{visible to the naked eye}} for a short time. As of October 2017, the Minor Planet Center had data on almost 745,000 objects in the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>Solar</b> System, of which almost 504,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations.|$|R
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} distribution of cosmic ray intensity was examined {{during the years}} 1974 - 1976 when the persistent high speed solar wind stream structures produced a well ordered <b>inner</b> heliosphere. <b>Solar</b> wind velocity is mapped back to the Sun and compared with cosmic ray intensity which is represented relative to the solar rotation average. Low solar wind velocity is observed to be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the occurrence of higher cosmic ray intensities at 1 AU. These relative enhancements cover a restricted range of heliographic longitudes and persist for several solar rotations. The observed solar wind and cosmic ray intensity relationships are consistent with a simple model suggested here in which cosmic ray modulation is very weak in the inner heliosphere, sunward of the first shock crossing on each field line and more intense in the outer heliosphere...|$|R
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System's history.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{conjecture}} {{that the}} matter composing the Oort cloud formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution. Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, {{it may be the}} source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} of the trapped electron environment of solar minimum conditions. Solar maximum {{models have been}} presented for the inner radiation zone (AE- 5 1967), and for the outer radiation zone (AE- 4 1967). The present solar minimum model consists of an inner zone model (AE- 5 1975 Projected) with an epoch of 1975, and an outer zone model with an epoch of 1964. With only minor modifications this latter model {{is identical to the}} AE- 4 1964 model presented previous. The model, however, has not previously been issued in computer form. AE- 4 1964 is based upon satellite data, while the <b>inner</b> zone <b>solar</b> minimum model AE- 5 1975 Projected consists entirely of extrapolations from AE- 5 1967. While the two components of the solar minimum model have epochs 11 years part, it is assumed that any differences between the successive solar minima are smaller than the model error, and the complete model is associated with an epoch of 1975...|$|R

By heat transfer capacity test, it was shown that when the liquid level height of working fluidwas about 19 % ∼ 22 % of the <b>inner</b> diameter of <b>solar</b> horizontal heat pipes, the optimal heat transfer performance was obtained. In addition, the heat transfer performance of solar horizontal heat pipes was affected adversely by the installation angle...|$|R
5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun.

40|$|Interplanetary trips using {{chemical}} propellants require {{years to}} complete. A recently completed study on an antiproton catalyzed fusion reaction propulsion system {{has shown that}} the specific impulses that can be obtained are between 1500 seconds for a contained system to over 100, 000 seconds for a system that directly uses the fusion reaction products. Thrust-to-weight ratios exceeding one can be sustained. This allows considerably shorter solar system travel times than conventional chemical propellants. Missions considered range from <b>inner</b> to outer <b>solar</b> system distances. A trade-off can be made between reducing travel time and reducing initial mass in low Earth orbit. Missions to the inner planets can be shortened considerably for a given mass ratio, while missions to the outermost planets will be several weeks in duration. (Author...|$|R
40|$|Voyager 2 is now beyond 75 AU {{and observing}} the {{descending}} {{phase of the}} solar cycle. Voyager 2 is the spacecraft {{in the best position}} to predict the plasma conditions at Voyager 1 (whose plasma instrument failed). We show that some of the Voyager 1 energetic particle events are associated with plasma changes observed at Voyager 2. Voyager currently observes low speeds, near 400 km/s, suggesting coronal hole flow is not observed. Since the latitudinal speed gradient which occurs in the <b>inner</b> heliosphere at <b>solar</b> minimum has not yet dev 3 eloped, we can use the speed decrease from Earth to Voyager 2 to determine the solar wind slowdown due to interaction with interstellar H and thus the interstellar H density at the termination shock.

5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System and causes the zodiacal light.

At the <b>inner</b> boundary (the <b>solar</b> surface) we specify the inflow velocity, mass flux, and temperature for each species, and at the outer boundary at large radius we allow the fluids to flow freely from the computational domain.

40|$|Energy spectra, charge composition, {{and flow}} {{patterns}} of solar and {{galactic cosmic rays}} were investigated using three nuclear-particle telescopes on Helios to measure electrons (50 keV to 8 MeV) protons (100 eV to 800 MeV) alpha particles (to 600 MeV per nucleon) heavier elements up to neon, (to 200 MeV per nucleon). The experiment includes a proportional counter to monitor solar X-rays in the range 2 to 8 keV. A collection of solar flare associated particle events are observed whereby coronal effects and spatial distribution of flare particles are determined over almost a whole solar cycle; a typical solar particle events are also observed.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the first}} time, the Rosetta {{spacecraft}} stays with a comet {{over an extended}} period of time during its journey in the <b>inner</b> the <b>solar</b> system. The data provided by the suite of instruments on board the Rosetta spacecraft, notably the ROSINA mass spectrometers and the pressure sensor, provides critical information concerning comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) and its environment. These measurements reinforce our knowledge of comet CG and enable us to describe the nucleus and the sources with more details. The observations allow us to better constrain and accordingly develop much more realistic models of the comet’s coma. We show a 3 D simulation of the gas and dust coma of comet CG using a Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo model performed with the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (Tenishev et al. 2008, 2011). The coma model presented includes a realistic nucleus shape, with a gas flux distribution and a surface temperature that takes into account irregularities and concavities of the nucleus. Along with the gas drag, the gravity field drives the dust dynamics and is therefore accurately computed around the irregular nucleus shape. This constitutes the state-of-the-art of cometary coma models, which are crucial to interpret instrument data and for further mission planning.
