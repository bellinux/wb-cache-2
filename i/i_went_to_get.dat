Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, [...] "And when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him. And {{he said it was}} good, and I shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls." ...|$|E

"I feared {{so little}} that I slept well, and even overslept; and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my picture quite confidently, and I {{could hardly believe}} {{it had not been}} turned in yet, though the station-master told me so. The {{substitute}} conductor had not seen it, but more than likely it was at the stables, where the cleaners would have found it in the car and turned it in. He was as robustly cheerful about it as ever, and offered to send an inquiry by the next car; but I said, Why shouldn't I go myself; and he said that was a good idea. So I went, and it was well I did, for my picture was not there, and I had saved time by going. It was not there, but the head man said I need not worry a mite about it; I was certain to get it sooner or later; it would be turned in, to a dead certainty. We became rather confidential, and I {{went so far as to}} explain about wanting to make my inquiries very quietly on Blakey's account: he would be annoyed if he heard of its loss, and it might react unfavorably on his health.|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{something}} I liked this morning, and I meant {{to tell it}} at dinner, but I forgot," [...] said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some oysters for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fish-man. A poor woman {{came in with a}} pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said 'No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to 'go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{moonlight}} night, and I {{could see}} a big head trying to thrust itself in {{at the other end}} of the hole. A moment later he began to scrape away at the sides. I lit the bundle of flax. It flared up fiercely, and I thrust it out full into the beast's face. He gave a roar, and off he went as fast as his feet would carry him. They tried it a dozen times if they did it once; but the torch was too much for them, and the seal bone in its middle must have given them some nasty wounds, for I generally saw blood on the snow in the morning. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a fresh store of meat and blubber I could see how they had trampled on the snow at the foot of the rock, and how they had scratched its face in trying to get up at it, but it was all no manner of good. I was chased two or three times by them when I went out to gather my cabbages, but I always managed to get into my hole before they overtook me, and they had learned to give that a wide berth.|$|E

40|$|A {{few months}} ago I was {{standing}} outside my local public library {{waiting for it to}} open. Within a few minutes a handful of people had joined me. When the doors opened we all filed in. Everyone else headed straight for the computers leaving me alone to browse the shelves. At first I was surprised by this—I never use the computers at the library—but then it occurred to me, I am {{one of the lucky ones}} who has a computer and access to the internet at home. This hasn’t always been the case though, and when I had no internet access at home where did <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> online? The library of course...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, now, don't quarrel, my good people," [...] {{interposed}} {{the doctor}} seriously--but I saw {{a twinkle in}} his eye. [...] "You'll have to spend some time together under the same roof and you won't improve the situation by disagreeing. You see, Peter, it was this way. Mr. Bennett was in town yesterday--where, as you are aware, there is a bad outbreak of smallpox--and took dinner in a boarding-house where one of the maids was ill. Last night she developed unmistakable symptoms of smallpox. The Board of Health at once got after all the people who were in the house yesterday, so far as they could locate them, and put them under quarantine. I came down here this morning and explained the matter to Mr. Bennett. I brought Jeremiah Jeffries to guard {{the front of the house}} and Mr. Bennett gave me his word of honour that he would not let anyone in by the back way while <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another policeman and make all the necessary arrangements. I have brought Thomas Wright and have secured the services of another man to attend to Mr. Bennett's barn work and bring provisions to the house. Jacob Green and Cleophas Lee will watch at night. I don't think there is much danger of Mr. Bennett's taking the smallpox, but until we are sure you must remain here, Peter." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{lived in}} that house for two days. Strickland went to his office daily, leaving me alone for eight or ten hours with Tietjens for my only companion. As long as the full light lasted I was comfortable, and so was Tietjens; but in the {{twilight}} she and I moved into the back verandah and cuddled each other for company. We {{were alone in the}} house, but none the less it was much too fully occupied by a tenant with whom I did not wish to interfere. I never saw him, but I could see the curtains between the rooms quivering where he had just passed through; I could hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had just quitted them; and I could feel when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a book from the dining-room that somebody was waiting {{in the shadows of the}} front verandah till I should have gone away. Tietjens made the twilight more interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms with every hair erect, and following the motions of something that I could not see. She never entered the rooms, but her eyes moved interestedly: that was quite sufficient. Only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all light and habitable she would come in with me and spend her time sitting on her haunches, watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my shoulder. Dogs are cheerful companions.|$|E
60|$|Everywhere {{about the}} cathedral beggars lay in wait, and the {{neighboring}} streets were lively with bargains of prickly pears spread {{open on the}} ground by old women who did not care whether any one bought or not. There were also bargains in palmistry; and at one place a delightful humorist was selling clothing at auction. He allured the bidders by having his left hand dressed as a puppet and holding a sparkling dialogue with it; when it {{did not respond to}} his liking he beat it with his right hand, {{and every now and then}} he rang a little bell. He had a pleased crowd about him in the sunny square; but it seemed to me that all the newer part of Granada was lively with commerce in ample, tram-trodden streets which gave the shops, larger than any we had seen out of Madrid, a chance uncommon in the narrow ways of other Spanish cities. Yet when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money on my letter of credit, I found the bank withdrawn from the modernity in a seclusion reached through a lovely patio. We were seated in old-fashioned welcome, such as used to honor a banker's customers in Venice, and all comers bowed and bade us good day. The bankers had no such question of the different signatures as vexed those of Valladolid, and after no more delay than due ceremony demanded, I went away with both my money and my letter, courteously seen to the door.|$|E

60|$|In {{the fall}} the loon (Colymbus glacialis) came, as usual, to moult and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild {{laughter}} before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen {{are on the}} alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one loon. Some station themselves {{on this side of}} the pond, some on that, for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the woods resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash angrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often successful. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a pail of water early in the morning I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would manoeuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a rain.|$|E

I am not," [...] {{admitted}} Susan in tremendous humility, [...] "I am not a military expert, Sophia Crawford, but even I can see that, and so could you if you were not determined to take a gloomy view of everything. The Huns have not got all the cleverness in the world. Have you not heard the story of Alistair MacCallum's son Roderick, from the Upper Glen? He is a prisoner in Germany and his mother got a letter from him last week. He wrote that he was being very kindly treated and that all the prisoners had plenty of food and so on, till you would have supposed everything was lovely. But when he signed his name, right in between Roderick and MacCallum, he wrote two Gaelic words that meant 'all lies' and the German censor did not understand Gaelic and thought it was all part of Roddy's name. So he let it pass, never dreaming how he was diddled. Well, I am going to leave the war to Haig {{for the rest of the}} day and make a frosting for my chocolate cake. And when it is made I shall put it on the top shelf. The last one I made I left it on the lower shelf and little Kitchener sneaked in and clawed all the icing off and ate it.

6000|$|... "This is what befell Mrs. M----, {{the wife}} of the surgeon at a [...] certain station on the {{southern}} confines of the insurrection. 'I [...] heard,' she says, 'a number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw [...] my husband driving furiously from the mess-house, waving his whip. [...] I ran to him, and, seeing a bearer with my child in his arms, I [...] caught her up, and got into the buggy. At the mess-house we found [...] all the officers assembled, together with sixty sepoys, who had [...] remained faithful. We went off in one large party, amidst a general [...] conflagration of our late homes. We reached the caravanserai at [...] Chattapore the next morning, and thence started for Callinger. At [...] this point our sepoy escort deserted us. We were fired upon by [...] match-lockmen, and one officer was shot dead. We heard, likewise, [...] that the people had risen at Callinger, so we returned and walked [...] back ten miles that day. M---- and I carried the child alternately. [...] Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke. We had no food amongst [...] us. An officer kindly lent us a horse. We were very faint. The [...] Major died, and was buried; also the Sergeant-major and some women. [...] The bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June. We were fired at [...] again by match-lockmen, and changed direction for Allahabad. Our [...] party consisted of nine gentlemen, two children, the sergeant and [...] his wife. On the morning of the twentieth, Captain Scott took [...] Lottie on to his horse. I was riding behind my husband, and she was [...] so crushed between us. She was two years old on the first of the [...] month. We were both weak through want of food and the effect of the [...] sun. Lottie and I had no head covering. M---- had a sepoy's cap I [...] found on the ground. Soon after sunrise we were followed by [...] villagers armed with clubs and spears. One of them struck Captain [...] Scott's horse on the leg. He galloped off with Lottie, and my poor [...] husband never saw his child again. We rode on several miles, [...] keeping away from villages, and then crossed the river. Our thirst [...] was extreme. M---- had dreadful cramps, so that I had to hold him [...] on the horse. I was very uneasy about him. The day before I saw [...] the drummer's wife eating chupatties, and asked her to give a piece [...] to the child, which she did. I now saw water in a ravine. The [...] descent was steep, and our only drinking-vessel was M----'s cap. 	Our horse got water, and I bathed my neck. I had no stockings, and [...] my feet were torn and blistered. Two peasants came in sight, and we [...] were frightened and rode off. The sergeant held our horse, and [...] M---- put me up and mounted. I think he must have got suddenly faint for I fell and he over me, on the road, when the horse started off. [...] Some time before he said, and Barber, too, that he could not live [...] many hours. I felt he was dying before we came to the ravine. He [...] told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took leave. [...] My brain seemed burnt up. No tears came. As soon as we fell, the [...] sergeant let go the horse, and it went off; so that escape was cut [...] off. We sat down on the ground waiting for death. Poor fellow! he [...] was very weak; his thirst was frightful, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him [...] water. Some villagers came, and took my rupees and watch. I took [...] off my wedding-ring, and twisted it in my hair, and replaced the [...] guard. I tore off the skirt of my dress to bring water in, but was [...] no use, for when I returned my beloved's eyes were fixed, and, [...] though I called and tried to restore him, and poured water into his [...] mouth, it only rattled in his throat. He never spoke to me again. [...] I held him in my arms till he sank gradually down. I felt frantic, [...] but could not cry. I was alone. I bound his head and face in my [...] dress, for there was no earth to bury him. The pain in my hands and [...] feet was dreadful. I went down to the ravine, and sat in the water [...] on a stone, hoping to get off at night and look for Lottie. When I [...] came back from the water, I saw that they had not taken her little [...] watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat. In an [...] hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the [...] ravine, and took off my jacket, and found the little chain. They [...] then dragged me to a village, mocking me all the way, and disputing [...] as to whom I was to belong to. The whole population came to look at [...] me. I asked for a bedstead, and lay down outside the door of a hut. [...] They had a dozen of cows, and yet refused me milk. When night came, [...] and the village was quiet, some old woman brought me a leafful of [...] rice. I was too parched to eat, and they gave me water. The [...] morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to [...] fetch me, who told me that a little child and three Sahibs had come [...] to his master's house. And so the poor mother found her lost one, [...] 'greatly blistered,' poor little creature. It is not for Europeans [...] in India to pray that their flight be not in the winter." ...|$|E
