40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new ?Pro-Poor Policy (PPP) ? index, which {{measures}} the pro-poorness of <b>government</b> <b>programmes,</b> {{as well as}} basic service delivery in education, health and infrastructure. The index provides a means to assess the targeting efficiency of <b>government</b> <b>programmes</b> compared to perfect targeting. The paper also deals with the policy issue of how targeting efficiency of <b>government</b> <b>programmes</b> varies across various socioeconomic groups. To this effect, the paper develops two types of PPP indices by socioeconomic groups, which are within-group and total-group PPP indices. The within-group PPP index captures how well targeted a programme is within a group. On the other hand, if our objective is to maximize poverty reduction at the national level, the targeting efficiency of particular group should be judged {{on the basis of}} total-group PPP index. Using micro unit-record data on household surveys from Thailand, Russia, Vietnam, and 15 African countries, the paper evaluates a wide range of <b>government</b> <b>programmes</b> and basic services.
