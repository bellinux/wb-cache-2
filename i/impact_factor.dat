25|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} made {{regarding}} the use of impact factors. For one thing, the <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> might not be consistently reproduced in an independent audit. There is also a more general debate on the validity of the <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> as a measure of journal importance and the effect of policies that editors may adopt to boost their <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> (perhaps to the detriment of readers and writers). Other criticism focuses on the effect of the <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Others have criticized the <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> more generally on the institutional background of the neoliberal academia, claiming that what is needed is not just its replacement with more sophisticated metrics but a democratic discussion on the social value of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{tradition}} established {{during the past}} two years [1, 2], we are pleased to report the newly released <b>Impact</b> <b>Factors</b> of MDPI open access journals by the means of an editorial. This year’s edition of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which is published annually by Thomson Reuters, includes seven journals published by MDPI, including three that received their first official <b>Impact</b> <b>Factors</b> – Energies, Entropy, and more surprisingly Viruses – the latest with citation data from 2009 only. We are pleased to announce that the continued growth in <b>Impact</b> <b>Factors</b> reported {{during the past two}} years has been sustained, and <b>Impact</b> <b>Factors</b> of MDPI journals continue on a growth path.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to carry out funding <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> of higher education overall and their peculiarities in Latvia.

25|$|New journals, {{which are}} indexed {{from their first}} {{published}} issue, will receive an <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> {{after two years of}} indexing; in this case, the citations to the year prior to Volume1, and the number of articles published in the year prior to Volume1, are known zero values. Journals that are indexed starting with a volume other than the first volume will not get an <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> until they have been indexed for three years. Occasionally, Journal Citation Reports assigns an <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> to new journals with less than two years of indexing, based on partial citation data. The calculation always uses two complete and known years of item counts, but for new titles one of the known counts is zero. Annuals and other irregular publications sometimes publish no items in a particular year, affecting the count. The <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> relates to a specific time period; it is possible to calculate it for any desired period, and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) also includes a five-year <b>impact</b> <b>factor.</b> The JCR shows rankings of journals by <b>impact</b> <b>factor,</b> if desired by discipline, such as organic chemistry or psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> (IF) or journal <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> (JIF) of an {{academic}} journal is a measure reflecting the yearly average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal. It is frequently used {{as a proxy for}} the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factors are often deemed to be more important than those with lower ones. The <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> was devised by Eugene Garfield, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information. Impact factors are calculated yearly starting from 1975 for journals listed in the Journal Citation Reports.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} on university-industry collaboration in Canada concluded, using mean <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> as a proxy, that the scientific {{impact of such}} research is not inferior to that of university research. Using field-normalized <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> and citation counts, this paper reexamines the Canadian case. It shows that, when <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> are field-normalized, university-industry papers are published, on average, in journals with lower <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> than papers originating from universities only. However, field-normalized citation values reveal the opposite: the average scientific impact of university-industry papers is significantly above that of both university-only papers and industry-only papers. Collaboration with industries is, thus far from detrimental to the scientific impact of university research and even increases it significantly...|$|R

We aimed to assess the influence of the authors’ nationality and collaborations, as well as radiological subspecialty, modality and study design, on subsequent publication rates and <b>impact</b> <b>factors.</b> Additionally, we wanted to investigate temporal changes in publication rates and <b>impact</b> <b>factors</b> between ECR 2000 and 2010 to assess the changing contribution to radiological research by different countries.|$|R

25|$|Another less {{insidious}} tactic journals employ is {{to publish}} {{a large portion of}} its papers, or at least the papers expected to be highly cited, early in the calendar year. This gives those papers more time to gather citations. Several methods, not necessarily with nefarious intent, exist for a journal to cite articles in the same journal which will increase the journal's <b>impact</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Academic {{search engines}} enable {{researchers}} to find academic literature {{and are used}} to obtain citation data for calculating performance metrics such as the H-index and <b>impact</b> <b>factor.</b> Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and OvGU demonstrated that most (web-based) academic search engines, especially Google Scholar, are not capable of identifying spam attacks. The researchers manipulated the citation counts of articles, and managed to make Google Scholar index complete fake articles, some containing advertising.|$|E
25|$|Having a paper (article or letter) {{published}} in Nature or any Nature publication such as Nature chemistry or Nature chemical biology is very prestigious, and the papers are often highly cited, {{which can lead}} to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these positive feedback effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like Nature and its closest competitor, Science, can be very fierce. Natures <b>impact</b> <b>factor,</b> a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by Thomson ISI), among the highest of any science journal.|$|E
25|$|Because {{citation}} counts have highly skewed distributions, {{the mean}} number of citations is potentially misleading if used to gauge the typical impact of articles in the journal rather than the overall impact of the journal itself. For example, about 90% of Natures 2004 <b>impact</b> <b>factor</b> was based on only a quarter of its publications, and thus the actual number of citations for a single article in the journal is in most cases much lower than {{the mean number}} of citations across articles. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship between impact factors of journals and the citation rates of the papers therein has been steadily decreasing since articles began to be available digitally.|$|E
