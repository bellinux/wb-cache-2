5|$|Sai Baba's {{real name}} remains unknown. The name 'Sai' {{was given to}} him by Mhalsapati when he arrived at Shirdi, a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a {{religious}} mendicant but can also mean 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes <b>holy</b> <b>father,</b> saintly father or (venerable) poor old man.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with Edward III, and accompanied him abroad on a diplomatic mission in 1329. That same year he was sent on an embassy to negotiate a marriage alliance with King Philip VI of France. His most important task, however, came in connection with a mission to the Papacy in Avignon. The young king—along with his government—was under the dominance of his mother Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, who had been responsible for the deposition of the king's father. Montagu explained the king's situation, and Pope John XXII asked for a special signal that assure him that he was dealing with the king in person. After Montagu's return, Richard Bury, Keeper of the Privy Seal, wrote to inform the pope that only letters containing the words pater sancte (<b>holy</b> <b>father),</b> in Edward's own handwriting, were indeed from the king. Only Edward, Bury and Montagu were party to the scheme.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} first {{exhibited}} on Christmas Day, 1808. Although {{it was generally}} coldly received, it was nevertheless Friedrich's first painting to receive wide publicity. The artist's friends publicly defended the work, while art critic Basilius von Ramdohr published a long article rejecting Friedrich's use of landscape in this context. He fundamentally challenged the idea that pure landscape painting could convey explicit meaning, writing {{that it would be}} [...] "a veritable presumption, if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar". Friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions. In his 1809 commentary on the painting, he compared the rays of the evening sun to the light of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Father.</b> The sinking of the sun suggests that the era when God reveals himself directly to man has passed. [...] This statement marked the only time Friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work.|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, and might even die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the <b>Holy</b> <b>Father</b> had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, Marquis Stanislas de La Rochethulon (1862–1945), {{founding}} {{president of}} the Anglo-French association Souvenir Normand (Norman Remembrance), which called itself [...] "a work of peace and justice inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror, who {{is considered to be}} the ancestor of all the royal families of Europe", sent this prayer to Pope Benedict XV in the midst of World War I. The Pope had an Italian translation published {{on the front page of}} L'Osservatore Romano on 20 January 1916. It appeared under the heading, [...] "The prayers of 'Souvenir Normand' for peace", with a jumbled explanation: [...] "'Souvenir Normand' has sent the <b>Holy</b> <b>Father</b> the text of some prayers for peace. We have pleasure in presenting in particular the prayer addressed to the Sacred Heart, inspired by the testament of William the Conqueror." [...] On 28 January 1916, the newspaper La Croix reprinted, in French, the article from L'Osservatore Romano, with exactly the same heading and explanation. La Rochethulon wrote to La Croix to clarify that it was not a prayer of Souvenir Normand; but he failed to mention La Clochette, the first publication in which it had appeared. Because of its appearance in L'Osservatore Romano and La Croix as a simple prayer for peace during World War I, the prayer became widely known.|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{was sent}} to Rome in 1912, where he {{attended}} the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 (sources vary). He {{was active in the}} consecration and entrustment to Mary. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons. According to Kolbe, They placed the black standard of the [...] "Giordano Brunisti" [...] under the windows of the Vatican. On this standard the archangel, St. Michael, was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the <b>Holy</b> <b>Father</b> (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully. Soon afterward, Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary. So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee.|$|E
