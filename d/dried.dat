The high temperature <b>drying</b> stage included three <b>drying</b> chamber temperature conditions of 60 °C, 65 °C, and 70 °C. The low temperature <b>drying</b> stage was conducted at temperatures of 45 °C and 50 °C. <b>Drying</b> characteristics were analyzed based on factors such as <b>drying</b> rate, color changes, energy consumption, and saponin content. The results were compared with those of the hot-air and sun <b>drying</b> methods. Results: The results revealed that increases in <b>drying</b> temperature caused a decrease in <b>drying</b> time and energy consumption for far-infrared <b>drying.</b> The saponin content decreased under all <b>drying</b> conditions after <b>drying,</b> the highest value (11. 34  mg/g) was observed at <b>drying</b> conditions of 60 ∼ 50 °C.
