We use least-cost methods, the most accurate and up-to-date land conversion dataset for East Africa, and interview <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> corridors, to develop a single, consistent methodology to systematically assess wildlife corridors at a national scale using Tanzania as a case study. Our research aimed {{to answer the following}} questions; (i) which corridors may still remain open (i. e. structurally connected) at a national scale, (ii) which have been potentially severed by anthropogenic land conversion (e. g., agriculture and settlements), (iii) where are other remaining potential wildlife corridors located, and (iv) which protected areas with lower forms of protection (e. g., Forest Reserves and Wildlife Management Areas) may act as stepping-stones linking more than one National Park and/or Game Reserve. We identify a total of 52 structural connections between protected areas that are potentially open to wildlife movement, and in so doing add 23 to those initially identified by other methods in Tanzanian Government reports. We find {{that the vast majority of}} corridors noted in earlier reports as "likely to be severed" have actually not been cut structurally (21 of 24). Nonetheless, nearly a sixth of all the wildlife corridors identified in Tanzania in 2009 have potentially been separated by land conversion, and a third now pass across lands likely to be converted to human use in the near future. Our study uncovers two reserves with lower forms of protection (Uvinza Forest Reserve in the west and Wami-Mbiki Wildlife Management Area in the east) that act as apparently crucial stepping-stones between National Parks and/or Game Reserves and therefore require far more serious conservation support.

40|$|Interest in the {{epidemiology}} {{of emerging}} diseases {{of humans and}} livestock {{as they relate to}} wildlife has increased greatly over the past several decades. Many factors, most anthropogenic, have facilitated the emergence of diseases from wildlife. Some livestock diseases have ‘‘spilled over’’ to wildlife and then ‘‘spilled back’’ to livestock. When a population is exposed to an infectious agent, depending on an interaction of factors involving the host, agent, and environment, the population may be resistant to infection or may become a dead-end host, a spillover host, or a maintenance host. Each exposure is unique; the same species of host and agent may respond differently in different situations.

40|$|Wildlife populations {{continue}} to decline in East Africa, {{both in and}} around Protected Areas (PAs). High quality <b>data</b> <b>on</b> the density and distribution of wildlife are essential for effective conservation and management. However, methods that accurately capture <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> locations at fine scales over large land areas {{have proven to be}} prohibitively difficult, expensive and time-consuming given the logistical and financial constraints of East African PAs. This study explores whether citizen science can be a reliable alternative to conventional methods of wildlife monitoring. Citizen science (CS) – also known as public participation in data gathering – has the potential to answer questions that have long plagued conservation scientists, as it has been shown to decrease monitoring costs while increasing public engagement in conservation issues. Despite the growing use of CS in ecological research, debates persist over the reliability of these datasets. An early and continuing concern of CS data is the effect of observer error, which if ignored can produce misleading ecological conclusions in modeled species-environment relationships. Through the implementation of a pilot program, I address the feasibility, reliability, and utility of CS for wildlife management in East African PAs. I ask (i) what problems and prospects arise when attempting to implement a CS program in East Africa? (ii) can the data generated from this method approximate {{the quality and quantity of}} data from more conventional sampling techniques?, and (iii) can CS data be useful for wildlife managers? To test these questions, this study uses two independent methods to gather spatial and demographic <b>data</b> <b>on</b> twenty-nine species within a private conservancy in southwestern Kenya. In method 1, I asked tourists to gather <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> during their game drives. The novel use of mobile technology aided my ability to enter and manage data quickly, though this study is limited by a lack of volunteer interest and motivation. I report several observations regarding the potential for future CS programs in the region, finding a need for PA administration to take ownership over program and data management. In reality, the large amount of time needed to organize and implement CS programs on a daily basis severely restricts the potential for CS in small East African PAs, as lodge managers have little time, inclination, and resources to devote to these programs. Method 2 uses line transects, a conventional ecological sampling technique, providing a validation dataset for testing the reliability of CS data. I use generalized linear models (GLMs) to model the species-environment relationships for nine commonly reported species, as it is a common analytical technique used by ecologists and wildlife managers for ecological inference. I find SS data performed reasonably well for eight out of nine species, with accuracies ranging from 60 - 87 %. However, these results are complicated by high uncertainty in model performance and ecological validity, thus limiting the usefulness of this data for management and conservation planning. I find GLMs are not the best methods for analyzing CS data as they lack the capacity to account for observer error, an important source of bias in CS datasets. When this error is sufficiently accounted for, CS data could be much more reliable for ecological inference by wildlife managers. In conclusion, I find citizen science to be a complex and difficult monitoring method, both logistically and analytically challenging. Though there is great potential for CS in East African PAs, substantial barriers exist and impede successful program establishment. I recommend future programs in East Africa carefully and realistically weigh their ability to address these obstacles before implementing a Safari Science approach to monitoring wildlife...|$|R

We describe recent environmental and societal changes that contribute to explain the current wildlife disease scenario, propose an updated list and ranking of relevant shared disease agents, illustrate key risk factors which often underlay shared infections, and provide a summary of recent progress in wildlife monitoring and disease control. We conclude, first, {{that there is a}} need for a better understanding of population dynamics and for good baseline <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> population trends. Also, there is a need to adapt our wildlife management and disease control strategies to a context of growing conflicts and increasing social complexity. Second, a few pathogens appear consistently in the rankings of relevant shared diseases and tend to receive most attention from the scientific community. However, most current research <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> diseases is still descriptive. Therefore, a deeper understanding of disease ecology and progress in risk factor identification is needed. Third, interventions regarding wildlife diseases are rarely widespread and not necessarily successful, and three aspects need urgent regulation in order to improve wildlife health: wildlife feeding, disease control in farmed or translocated wildlife, and hunting offal disposal. While the drivers of disease emergence are still active, awareness is also growing in governmental and supra-governmental agencies, farmers, and the academy, contributing to create a fertile ground for future innovative disease control efforts.

Field <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> mortality was collected from June 2009 to May 2011.

We assessed the conservation significance of this site using <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> and habitat conditions collected during a comprehensive primate survey. Scores were attributed to a system of variables and sub-variables to assess the conservation value of the proposed park at the national level. We identified a total of 10 diurnal primate species (eight monkeys, two apes) and flooded forests were considered as a key habitat for primates as they hold a greater number of species than terra firma forests. We recorded the presence of 12 mammal species listed under the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including four classified as Endangered (two Primates, one Proboscidae and one Insectivora).

40|$|The {{conservation}} of tropical forest carbon stocks offers {{the opportunity to}} curb climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and simultaneously conserve biodiversity. However, there has been considerable debate {{about the extent to}} which carbon stock conservation will provide benefits to biodiversity in part because whether forests that contain high carbon density in their aboveground biomass also contain high animal diversity is unknown. Here, we empirically examined medium to large bodied groundâ dwelling mammal and bird (hereafter â wildlifeâ) diversity and carbon stock levels within the tropics using camera trap and vegetation data from a pantropical network of sites. Specifically, we tested whether tropical forests that stored more carbon contained higher wildlife species richness, taxonomic diversity, and trait diversity. We found that carbon stocks were not a significant predictor for any of these three measures of diversity, which suggests that benefits for wildlife diversity will not be maximized unless wildlife diversity is explicitly taken into account; prioritizing carbon stocks alone will not necessarily meet biodiversity conservation goals. We recommend conservation planning that considers both objectives because there is the potential for more wildlife diversity and carbon stock conservation to be achieved for the same total budget if both objectives are pursued in tandem rather than independently. Tropical forests with low elevation variability and low tree density supported significantly higher wildlife diversity. These tropical forest characteristics may provide more affordable proxies of wildlife diversity for future multiâ objective conservation planning when fine scale <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> are lacking...|$|R

Estimates suggest that wildlife strikes cost the civil aviation industry in the U. S. up to $ 625 million annually, and nearly 500 {{people have been killed}} in wildlife strikes worldwide. Most wildlife strikes occur in the airport environment: 72 percent of all strikes occur when the aircraft is ≤ 500 ft (152 m) above ground level, and 41 percent of strikes occur when the aircraft is on the ground during landing or takeoff. Thus, management efforts to reduce wildlife hazards are focused at the airport. There are many techniques used to reduce wildlife hazards at airports, and these usually work best when used in an integrative fashion. Here, we discuss the available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> strikes with aircraft, summarize legal considerations, explain why wildlife are attracted to airports and how to identify important wildlife attractants, describe commonly-used tools and techniques for reducing wildlife hazards at airports, and explain how airports can enlist the help of professional wildlife biologists to manage wildlife hazards.

40|$|Wildlife {{consumption}} can {{be viewed}} as an ecosystem provisioning service (the production of a material good through ecological functioning) because of wildlife's ability to persist under sustainable levels of harvest. We used the case of wildlife harvest and consumption in northeastern Madagascar to identify the distribution of these services to local households and communities to further our understanding of local reliance on natural resources. We inferred these benefits from demand curves built with <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> sales transactions. <b>On</b> average, the value of wildlife provisioning represented 57 % of annual household cash income in local communities from the Makira Natural Park and Masoala National Park, and harvested areas produced an economic return of U. S. $ 0. 42 ha - 1 · year - 1. Variability in value of harvested wildlife was high among communities and households with an approximate 2 orders of magnitude difference in the proportional value of wildlife to household income. The imputed price of harvested wildlife and its consumption were strongly associated (p < 0. 001), and increases in price led to reduced harvest for consumption. Heightened monitoring and enforcement of hunting could increase the costs of harvesting and thus elevate the price and reduce consumption of wildlife. Increased enforcement would therefore be beneficial to biodiversity conservation but could limit local people's food supply. Specifically, our results provide an estimate of the cost of offsetting economic losses to local populations from the enforcement of conservation policies. By explicitly estimating the welfare effects of consumed wildlife, our results may inform targeted interventions by public health and development specialists as they allocate sparse funds to support regions, households, or individuals most vulnerable to changes in access to wildlife. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology...|$|R

In 1990, our administration approached us again asking this time for an update of our ten-year-old handbook. John and I went to work, and with the assistance of Evin Oneale of the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research unit, and Bill Hepworth and John Schneidmiller of the WGFD, have just completed the second edition. This edition is over 600 pages and titled 2 ̆ 2 The Handbook of Wildlife Depredation Techniques. 2 ̆ 2 Neither of us care to be around when a third edition is needed. In this handbook we have attempted to cover any type of damage situation our personnel may encounter. Although the primary function of this manual is to inform department personnel about proper and uniform damage prevention and evaluation techniques, it also provides relative and pertinent information concerning the many aspects of wildlife depredation. Information for this handbook has been compiled from techniques developed by our personnel, personnel from other states and provinces, and published <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> depredation. There are nine chapters, a reprint, and Appendix section in this handbook. We will briefly summarize each chapter regarding its contents...|$|R
5000|$|By 2012, California {{was one of}} only 13 {{states still}} using [...] "Game" [...] in the title of their {{wildlife}} agency. The State Legislature changed the Department's name to Fish and <b>Wildlife</b> <b>on</b> January <b>1,</b> 2013. The legislation followed recommendations of a 51-member stakeholder advisory group. 18 other states use the term [...] "wildlife," [...] while the others generally use [...] "natural resources" [...] or [...] "conservation," [...] in the titles of their Departments. This change reflects the trend toward expansion of the Agencies' missions from sport fishing and hunting alone, to protection of non-game wildlife and whole ecosystems.|$|R

We conduct meta-analyses of the available studies to construct a spreadsheet-based “Benefits Estimation Toolkit ”- a set of valuation and visitation models, value tables and databases. This Toolkit allows users to generate comprehensive estimates of the economic values associated with many conservation-oriented uses of undeveloped lands. Specifically, users can employ the Toolkit to estimate the dollar values of the benefits generated by a particular undeveloped area. The quantified benefits comprise open space property value premiums received by properties located near undeveloped lands; benefits to participants in wildlife-associated recreation activities; benefits associated with the conservation of threatened, endangered or rare species; and ecosystem services provided by terrestrial habitats, wetlands and aquatic habitat improvements. We also use available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> National <b>Wildlife</b> Refuge visitation and state-level participation in wildlife-associated recreation activities to construct two sets of models that allow users to estimate the number of wildlife-associated activity days an existing or proposed conservation area generates per year, or the additional days tha...|$|R

They {{have been used}} extensively worldwide in agriculture, industrial, and health applications. Their degradation is very slow in the polar regions due to the low temperatures and winter darkness. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the concentrations of polychlorobyphenils (PCBs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) and other marine fishes and invertebrates from NE Greenland. The concentration increases were assessed by calculating the biomagnification factor (BMF) among pairs of alleged predator-prey organisms. PFOS were  Careproctusreinhardti (5. 02  ng/g wet wt)  > stomach content of Amblyraja hyperborea (1. 4454  ng/g wet wt)  > Boreogadus saida (0. 355  ng/g wet wt). The higher contaminant biomagnification was found in the predator → prey pairs: shark → invertebrates (BMF_Σ 6 PCBs =  75 - 88672, BMF_Σ 3 PBDEs =  14 - 124), shark → A. hyperborea → preys, according to their diets. Ecotoxicological baseline <b>data</b> <b>on</b> marine <b>wildlife</b> in NE Greenland are particularly important due to the risk of prospect petroleum activities...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Species-specific {{population}} {{data are}} important for the effective management and conservation of wildlife populations within protected areas. However such data are often logistically difficult and expensive to attain for species that are rare and have large ranges. Camera trap surveys provide a non-invasive, inexpensive and effective method for obtaining population level <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> species. Provided that species can be individually identified, a photographic capture-recapture framework {{can be used to}} provide density estimates. Spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models have recently been developed, and are currently considered the most robust method for analysing capture-recapture data. Camera trap data sourced from a leopard survey performed in uMkhuze Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was analysed using SPACECAP, a Bayesian inference-based SECR modelling program. Overall hyaena density for the reserve was estimated at 10. 59 (sd= 2. 10) hyaenas/ 100 km 2, which is comparable to estimates obtained using other methods for this reserve and some other protected areas in southern Africa. SECR methods are typically conservative in comparison to other methods of measuring large carnivore populations, which is somewhat supported by higher estimates in other nearby reserves. However, large gaps in time between studies and the variety of historical methods used confound comparisons between estimates. The findings from this study provide support for both camera trap surveys and SECR models in terms of deriving robust population data for spotted hyaenas and other individually recognisable species. Such data allows for studies on the drivers of population and distribution changes for such species in addition to temporal and spatial activity patterns and habitat preference for select species. The generation of accurate population data for ecologically important predators provides reserve managers with robust data upon which to make informed management decisions. This study shows that estimates for spotted hyaenas can be produced from an existing survey of leopards, which makes photographic capture-recapture methods a sensible and cost-effective option for the less charismatic species. The implementation of standardized and scientifically robust population estimation methods such as SECR using camera trap data would contribute appreciably to the conservation of important wildlife species and the ecological processes they support...|$|R
40|$|As long linear {{features}} on the landscape, railways, roads and highways have impacts <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> and wildlife habitat that are disproportionate {{to the area of}} land that they occupy. In addition to impacts on habitat, highways and railways are sources of road mortality that threaten wildlife populations. Indirect effects <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> include reduced access to habitat due to road avoidance and human exploitation. Transportation infrastructure also undermines ecological processes through the fragmentation of wildlife populations, restriction of wildlife movements, and the disruption of gene flow and metapopulation dynamics. A variety of techniques have been used to mitigate the impacts of transportation systems <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> movements with mixed success. To make progress <b>on</b> these issues <b>wildlife</b> biologists must: <b>1)</b> recognize the potential long-term effects of highways and railways <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> populations and advocate more strongly for appropriate mitigation measures, 2) document the impacts of transportation infrastructure <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> populations, 3) conduct landscape analyses to identify “connectivity zones” and use these analyses to engage transportation planners earlier in the planning process, 4) enlist transportation engineers to help solve technical problems, and 5) design and conduct good monitoring studies to effectively evaluate various mitigation techniques...|$|R
