The Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox, restored to its original 1931 Art Deco state after years of being derelict, is home to the Spokane Symphony Orchestra. The Metropolitan Performing Arts Center was restored in 1988 and renamed the Bing Crosby Theater in 2006 to honor the former Spokanite.

5|$|As far as {{possible}} elderly inmates were expected to undertake {{the same kind of}} work as the younger men and women, although concessions were made to their relative frailty. They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic tasks. In 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as <b>knitting,</b> embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E

Also, for comparison, <b>knits</b> made with poodle hair and PA multifilament yarns has been produced. The literature review has outlined that typical wowen fabric and <b>knits</b> functional properties such as thermal conductivity, air and water permeability are analyzed quite often. However, aberrant protein fibre <b>knits</b> are designed and analyzed more rarely. For this reason, functional properties research that regards to <b>knits</b> made with dog hair will evaluate the following features- thermal properties, <b>knits</b> fiber compositions, dependencies between <b>knits</b> structual parameters and functional properties. The thesis work has analyzed <b>knits</b> made from different dog breeds hair and different mixture yarns. The experimental results, such as structual indicators, air pearmeability, thermal conductivity indicators and thermal exhange processes were determined and evaluated. Overall, analysis has been made for 19 <b>knits</b> with different percentage compositions. The yarn composition influence was determined on investigated <b>knits</b> characteristics and <b>knits</b> thermal characteristics of the comparative analysis were produced. It was established {{that there is a}} relationship between analyzed <b>knits</b> thickness and air permeability. The thermal conductivity indicators remain stable after increasing dog hair percentage in yarn mixtures. It was also found that <b>knits</b> made with Spaniel dog hair have lower thermal conductivity. <b>Knits</b> made with Yorkshire and Spaniel hair have the best properties of thermal resistance.

The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs, with Bosnian Muslims and Croats forming less than four percent of the population. Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm. Like other village girls, Bursać did not go to school—only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar. A shepherdess until age fourteen, she later helped her mother with housekeeping and agricultural work. Bursać became skilled at weaving, spinning, <b>knitting</b> and embroidery before completing a six-month tailoring course in Drvar.|$|E

50|$|In the {{simplest}} <b>knitted</b> fabric pattern, all the stitches are <b>knit</b> or purl; {{this is known}} as a garter stitch. Alternating rows of <b>knit</b> stitches and purl stitches produce what is known as a stockinette pattern/stocking stitch. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of <b>knit</b> and purl stitches. For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of <b>knit</b> stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating rows of <b>knit</b> and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as seed/moss stitch: the stitches alternate between <b>knit</b> and purl in every wale and along every row.|$|R

Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as <b>knitting,</b> were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy.

Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed <b>knitting,</b> needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings.

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers.

Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level.

The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued <b>knitting</b> and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E
