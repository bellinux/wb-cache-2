25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, {{the only way to}} <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.|$|E
25|$|When a team {{is willing}} to sign an {{upcoming}} free agent, but the player's current team wants something in return, it {{might be in the}} best interest of both clubs to execute a sign-and-trade deal. This occurs when one team signs one of its free agents and immediately trades that player to another team. A sign-and-trade is beneficial to both the player and the teams; the player receives a bigger contract than he might ordinarily <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> team that he would like to play for, while the trading club gets something in return for a free agent, and the recipient of the trade gets the player they desire. Sign-and-trades are a reality in the NBA because of the CBA's rules: unlike baseball, where teams losing free agents are compensated with draft picks or cash, NBA teams that lose free agents receive no compensation.|$|E

[...] Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the trial-and-error gameplay, saying that [...] "when forced to blindly jump, die, then discover what you missed, where I come from, that’s just cheating." ...|$|E

500|$|Mega Man Battle Network was {{developed}} by Capcom Production Studio 2 amidst the success of Nintendo's portable RPG franchise Pokémon. Rather than extend upon the traditional action-platform formula for the Mega Man series as they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, Capcom followed Nintendo's example on the latter's then-newest handheld console, the GBA. While creating Battle Network, director Masahiro Yasuma found difficulty in blending action attributes with [...] "the kind of fun you <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Pokémon game" [...] {{in order to make}} it enjoyable, new, and fresh. Yasuma recalled that production was further challenged because no effective precursor of its type had been made before. Producer Keiji Inafune stated that the development team wanted to add a [...] "real world" [...] feel to the Mega Man series by placing the protagonist of Battle Network in a location where the internet is prevalent. With the release of the portable GBA, the team felt that they should target modern gamers, specifically children, as an audience for the new series. The developers thought such a theme would be both successful and relevant because these younger gamers grew up with and utilized such technology on a daily basis. To ensure the game's popularity, Capcom marketed Battle Network alongside an afternoon anime adaptation, emphasized head-to-head matches between players, and provided fans with exclusive content via special events.|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>A</b> to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

[...] However, none of the original ancient sources has Zeno discussing the sum of any infinite series.

2500|$|After {{arguing that}} both ASCAP and BMI were showing bias towards {{international}} broadcasters who own terrestrial radio stations, Pandora announced on June 11, 2013 {{that it would}} attempt to acquire KXMZ, a radio station in South Dakota, under the presumption that doing so would allow it to access the same preferential licensing terms offered to services such as iHeartRadio (which is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., itself America's largest radio broadcaster). The move was criticized by David Israelite, CEO of the National Music Publishers Association, who declared that Pandora was now [...] "at war with songwriters," [...] and had lost its credibility because it was resorting to [...] "lawsuits and gimmicks" [...] to make its point. However, a member of Public Knowledge praised the move, by stating that it was [...] "a perfect example of the twisted incentives and strange results we <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> music licensing system {{that is based on}} who wants a license instead of just {{what they want to do}} with the music they’re using." [...] ASCAP also objected to the deal, filing a petition to deny with the FCC. The organization argued that the acquisition was not in the public interest because of Pandora's intent to use it as a [...] "bargaining chip" [...] for royalty payments. ASCAP also alleged that Pandora did not provide enough information about its ownership structure, failing to prove that less than 25% of the company was owned by foreign interests. On January 14, 2014, the FCC denied the acquisition until Pandora [...] "demonstrate adequate support for its foreign ownership compliance certification." ...|$|E
