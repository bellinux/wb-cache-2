"When we {{got there}} by the aid of God in the Year of Our Salvation 1615, not only were we kindly {{received}} by His Holiness the great Pope, with the Holy College of the Cardinals and a gathering of bishops and nobles, and even the joy and general happiness of the Roman People, but we and three others (whom the Japanese Christians had specially designated to announce their condition {{with respect to the}} Christian religion) were heard, rested, and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> hoping, dispatched as quickly as possible." [...] (Sotelo, [...] ).|$|E
500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> so near to yonder opening!" [...] cried Larry, vexed beyond endurance. [...] "If we {{only had}} a plank, or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They were traders--and nothing more. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> And {{when they}} were rich they got splendid clothes and feasted and rested. Much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] he replied, [...] "let us to work, and it <b>is</b> but <b>just,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to sup together, and {{you know}} my name, that I should be put {{on an equal footing}} with yourself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (delicately rebuking her). My dear: {{we cannot}} {{sit down to}} lunch <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> <b>We</b> shall come back again. We must have no bravado. (Gloria winces, and goes into the hotel without a word.) Come, Dolly. (As she goes into the hotel door, the waiter comes out with plates, etc., for two {{additional}} covers on a tray.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saw Link and {{his father}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming home," [...] {{answered}} Sid Todd. [...] "Merwell said he had seen nothing of the thieves." ...|$|E
60|$|Kate {{was equally}} unsuccessful; {{and we might}} have starved but for a lucky {{incident}} that happened <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{ready to give up}} in despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "We got {{a message}} from you, Miss Abbeway, a little time ago," [...] Furley remarked. [...] "It was countermanded, though, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> ready to start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not that song!' roared the Amal, {{stopping}} {{his ears}} with both his hands. 'Will you drive us blood-mad again, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> settling down into our sober senses, {{and finding out}} what our lives were given us for?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have arrived}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{assembling}} {{to talk about}} the things that concern our souls, the future life, and the Good Spirit. Will you and your men sit down and listen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{invite you}} all," [...] he said, [...] "to supper with me. It is {{something}} of an occasion, this! For I do not think that we shall all meet again <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now for a very long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Marie,' he began, 'I {{spoke to}} you the other day about some {{property}} which for certain purposes was placed in your name <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> leaving Paris.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{letter from}} the {{lighthouse}} from Jim," [...] said the mate, lighting his pipe, [...] "received it this forenoon <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> gettin' ready to come off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you {{remember}} our resolution against mere pleasure-hunting? That adventure at Interlachen {{seemed to be}} meant to bring us up short <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> getting into that line.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} that ghost all to yourselves," [...] added Carl. [...] "Hope it visits your camp to-night---I guess you'll be leaving in the morning <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing." [...] And {{that was all that}} was said by the Spink crowd.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} thought of that, Aline," [...] he said, gravely. [...] "If ever I did change my mind, {{it would be that}} I might always be with Edgar and be great friends with him, all through our lives, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too soon," [...] she answered, [...] "and {{you would}} not understand. I might say things to you which would perhaps end our friendship, which would give you a wrong impression. No, let us stay <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> for a little time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but that's dangerous!" [...] cried {{one of the}} {{students}} who had just been initiated. [...] "Why, the slide might come down <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> getting the lanterns!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Further," [...] Quest continued, [...] "there's my chauffeur. He {{knows exactly}} {{what time it was}} when the tire of my car blew out, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{starting}} for New York." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} {{he was all}} right. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting down to supper, we heard a cat squalling outside. Montgomery flung a three-pound tin of the cio-root at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just imagine, Bob Kellogg, as we're sailing along now, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{and never}} mind what for, that a boat should bear down upon us with armed men in it, {{what would you}} do to repel boarders? Think you could rise to it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Notably, {{speaking}} {{by phone}} to reporters in November 2012, {{one of the}} new Abu Qaqas said [...] "We are together with al Qaeda, they are promoting the cause of Islam, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing. Therefore they help us in our struggle and we help them, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|He didn’t think o’ nothing better, and {{one night}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> making the Channel ’e tried ’is plan. He was in the second mate’s watch, and by-and-by ’e leans over the wheel and says to ’im in a low voice, [...] "This is my last v’y’ge, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are dead}} beat," [...] Sophy exclaimed. [...] "We've {{been having a}} secret {{rehearsal}} this afternoon without Graillot, and he came in <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> finishing. He was perfectly furious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And he's always late to breakfast," [...] said Mrs. Petter; [...] "I {{believe if}} {{we sat down}} at the table at nine o'clock he would come in <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> finishing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems very}} much as you {{described}} him," [...] Marcia answered. [...] "To tell you the truth, his sudden appearance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> talking about him rather took my breath away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gloom-loving {{but not in}} {{the least}} gloomy. They merely take their sadness pleasurably, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> accused of taking our pleasures sadly. Have you noticed that dreadful Klopstock youth has been {{pounding}} past us at shortening intervals. He'll come up and talk if he half catches your eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is impossible, Sam, {{because he}} is on an express, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> As it is, he'll gain on us {{when he gets to}} Spokane, for he will go through without waiting, while we'll either have to lay over or go by some other route that is much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Newton, what I am I ain't ashamed on, nor {{yet what}} I does. Let me have the honour of {{drinking}} {{a glass of}} wine with you, Mr. Newton. You see us <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> I wish it was better, but it couldn't be welcomer. Your health, Mr. Newton." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet {{one morning}} he appeared, at about half past nine, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{finishing}} breakfast. It was sunny {{and warm and}} beautiful, so we asked him please {{to come with us}} picnicking.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{starting}} Vrouw Prinsloo {{appeared from}} behind the other wagon, and with her Marie, who, I noticed, was very pale and whose beautiful eyes were red, as though with weeping.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> starting, I met the lad William Wood, who {{had come}} down from the Mission huts, where he lived with Mr. Owen, and was {{wandering}} about with an anxious face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} your day's work and I've done mine," [...] he remarked. [...] "I dare say of the two, yours {{is the more}} worthy. We'll go <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> Get rid {{of those people who}} are waiting, Aaron. I had a look at them. They are all the usual class--cadgers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we have," [...] {{the other}} said stoutly. [...] "I have seen <b>just</b> <b>as</b> bright nights on the Thames. I have stood down by Paul's Stairs {{and watched the}} {{reflection}} of the moon on the water, and the lights of the houses on the bridge, and the passing boats, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect the}} beggars are {{gathering}} their forces <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gathering ours," [...] {{one of the}} Hussars said, as they sat round a fire they had lighted with some drift-wood picked up on shore. The heat {{was in no way}} required, but the light was cheerful, and the smoke kept away troublesome insects.|$|R
