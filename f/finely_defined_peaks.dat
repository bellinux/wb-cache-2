40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{assessment of the}} effect of national and international knowledge spillovers on innovation at a <b>finely</b> <b>defined</b> sectoral level for six major industrialised countries over the period 1981 - 1995. International spillovers are always found to be effective in increasing innovative productivity. The paper then uses self-citations to investigate the role of prior R&D experience in enhancing a country¿s ability to understand and improve upon external knowledge (absorptive capacity). The empirical results show that absorptive capacity increases the elasticity of a country¿s innovation to both national and international spillovers. The larger the gap of a country with the technological leaders, the weaker is this effect, but the larger is the country¿s potential to increase it.

However, the interest of these biomarkers in clinical practice remains ill-defined {{and will have to}} be clarified in future studies. Such biomarkers should help to <b>finely</b> <b>define</b> patients who will benefit most from these costly and potentially toxic drugs. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), namely anti-CTLA 4 and anti-PD 1 /PD-L 1 antibodies, demonstrated efficacy across multiple types of cancer. However, only subgroups of patients respond to these therapies. Additionally, CPI can induce severe immune-related adverse events (irAE). Biomarkers that predict efficacy and toxicity may help define the patients who may benefit the most from these costly and potentially toxic therapies.

30|$|Typically, a peak {{detection}} algorithm {{consists of}} combination of selected features from their peak model and subsequent computational processes, such as classification. Based on the literature, Dumpala et al. (1982) used a <b>defined</b> <b>peak</b> model, and then introduced a classification process {{to detect a}} peak signal {{in the analysis of}} gastric electrical activity. Dingle et al. (1993); Liu et al. (2002); Acir et al. (2005); Acir 2005); Liu et al. (2013) also used the <b>defined</b> <b>peak</b> models and different classification processes to detect peaks in EEG signal with epileptiform activity. The classifiers that have hitherto been used for signal peak detection include rule-based (Dumpala et al. 1982; Adam et al. 2015; Dingle et al. 1993), AdaBoost (Liu et al. 2002), radial basis function network (Acir et al. 2005), support vector machine (SVM) (Liu et al. 2013), radial basis support vector machine (Acir et al. 2005), artificial neural network (ANN) (Liu et al. 2002), and expert system (Liu et al. 2002; Dingle et al. 1993). In general, utilization of a peak detection algorithm provides the best performance in various applications. However, the various algorithms have used different peak models and different classification approaches combined in a particular peak detection algorithm. Moreover, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there are very reports comparing the performance of different peak models using the same classification platform, such as a rule-based classifier (Adam et al. 2014 a, 2014 b, 2015). The existing methods tend to have poor performance with <b>peak</b> models <b>defining</b> many <b>peak</b> features, for example, the detection performance declined to nil when the classifier employed all 11 features from Liu model (Adam et al. 2014 b).|$|R

For decoding of convolutional codes at the receiver end, Viterbi decoder {{is often used}} to have high priority. This decoder meets the demand of high speed and low power. At present, the design of a competent system in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology requires these VLSI parameters to be <b>finely</b> <b>defined.</b> The proposed asynchronous method focuses on reducing the power consumption of Viterbi decoder for various constraint lengths using asynchronous modules. The asynchronous designs are based on commonly used Quasi Delay Insensitive (QDI) templates, namely, Precharge Half Buffer (PCHB) and Weak Conditioned Half Buffer (WCHB). The functionality of the proposed asynchronous design is simulated and verified using Tanner Spice (TSPICE) in 0. 25 [*]µm, 65 [*]nm, and 180 [*]nm technologies of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacture Company (TSMC).
