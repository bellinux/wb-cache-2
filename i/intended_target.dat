5|$|The hijackers {{stormed the}} aircraft's cockpit {{approximately}} 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. However, Ziad Jarrah, who had {{trained as a}} pilot, {{took control of the}} aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have claimed that the <b>intended</b> <b>target</b> was the Capitol Building.|$|E
5|$|Details about Kentuckians first animal {{transport}} journey are not known, but her second trip began 14 March 1918 when she sailed from Newport News, Virginia, with 848 animals for Saint-Nazaire, where she unloaded {{all but the}} four animals that had died or were destroyed during the voyage. On 24 April, during a convoy crossing in Army service, Naval Armed Guardsmen on Kentuckian sighted a torpedo heading towards the second ship behind her in the column. Opening fire on the torpedo, the gun crew claimed the hit that caused the torpedo to explode short of its <b>intended</b> <b>target.</b> Further details of Kentuckians Army service are not available.|$|E

5|$|In the end {{the reform}} proved unsuccessful. The {{government}} only managed to withdraw 14 billion rubles from circulation of the country's money supply against an <b>intended</b> <b>target</b> of 81.5 billion rubles. As a result, the Pavlov reform did not {{put an end to}} inflation. Prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent, while the Soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 2030 percent of GNP. In the aftermath of the reform, inflation exceeded the 50 percent mark every month.|$|E
5|$|Occupied Belgium {{was also}} {{targeted}} by the Allied bombers from both the British RAF and American USAAF. The policy led to high civilian casualties as bombs missed their intended targets and fell on civilian areas. In a raid on the Erla Motor Works in the Belgian town of Mortsel (near Antwerp) in April 1943, just two bombs dropped by the B-17s of the U.S. 8th Air Force fell on the <b>intended</b> <b>target.</b> The remaining 24 tons of bombs fell on civilian areas of the town, killing 936 and injuring 1,600 more in just eight minutes. The Allied policy was condemned by many leading figures within Belgium, including Cardinal van Roey.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the <b>intended</b> <b>target</b> of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E
50|$|The 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq {{began with a}} decapitation strike against Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi military leaders. These air strikes failed to kill their <b>intended</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|R
50|$|A precision-guided munition (PGM, smart weapon, smart munition, smart bomb) is {{a guided}} munition {{intended}} to precisely hit a specific target, to minimize collateral damage and increase lethality against <b>intended</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} a tax levied on a luxury item such as jewelry. Such a tax, while <b>intended</b> to <b>target</b> the wealthy, may not actually accomplish this objective, as the wealthy can simply choose to buy less jewelry. Instead of collecting {{more money from}} the wealthy, the tax {{has the effect of}} hurting jewelry merchants, who are not the <b>intended</b> <b>targets</b> of the tax.|$|R
5|$|Shōhō {{was quickly}} located again {{that morning and}} sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the oiler, , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a light cruiser. A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough {{that she had to}} be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their <b>intended</b> <b>target.</b> Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E

25|$|That night, LVF gunmen {{opened fire}} on a disco in a mainly {{nationalist}} area of Dungannon. Four civilians were wounded and one, a former Provisional IRA member, was killed. Police believed that the disco itself was the <b>intended</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, U.S. {{imports of}} [...] "automobile trucks" [...] from West Germany {{declined}} to {{a value of}} $5.7 million—about one-third the value imported in the previous year.

5000|$|The US {{administration}} and Pakistani authorities have publicly claimed that civilian deaths from the attacks are minimal. Leaked military documents {{reveal that the}} vast majority of people killed have not been the <b>intended</b> <b>targets,</b> with approximately 13% of deaths being the <b>intended</b> <b>targets,</b> 81% being other militants, and 6% being civilians. The identities of collateral victims are usually not investigated by US forces, who systematically count each male military-age corpse as an [...] "enemy killed in action" [...] unless there is clear proof to the contrary, as long as the male was in a militant facility at the time. Estimates for civilian deaths range from 158 to 965. Amnesty International found that a number of victims were unarmed and that some strikes could amount to war crimes.|$|R
50|$|Ledda kills {{all of his}} <b>intended</b> <b>targets,</b> {{except the}} last, a {{high-ranking}} government official, Baron de Haeck, who manages to get away because of Ledda's worsening Alzheimer's, which leads him to forget to put the firing pin in his silenced pistol when preparing for the hit.|$|R
25|$|Protein–protein {{signalling}} interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due {{to their}} specificity and pervasiveness.

50|$|Although {{originally}} designed as an anti-ship missile (AShM), the missile was eventually developed into an air-to-surface missile that can engage various targets. When {{used as an}} anti-ship missile, its <b>intended</b> <b>targets</b> are boats with 180 ton displacement or less, such as missile or torpedo armed FAC, patrol boats, and gunboats.|$|R
25|$|The blurriness is a shame, because Rosenfeld has a {{legitimate}} argument. He explicitly rejects {{the view that}} any attack on Israeli policy equals anti-Semitism. Rather, his <b>intended</b> <b>target</b> is those Jews who reject {{the very existence of}} a Jewish state, and who express their opposition in shrieks that rise to equating Israel with the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1915, Mills {{opened the}} Mills Munitions Factory in Birmingham, making the Mills Bomb Hand Grenade. Until then, grenades had often proved as deadly to the thrower {{as to the}} <b>intended</b> <b>target.</b> The 1st grenade used when war broke out in 1914 was a {{cast-iron}} canister on an 18-inch stick, which was dangerous to use because it often caught on the trench front when lobbed.|$|E
50|$|The Northrop Grumman Brilliant Anti-Tank (BAT) is a United States {{submunition}} round dispensed from a missile. It {{is capable}} of independently identifying and attacking armored vehicles. The BAT uses acoustic sensors to identify its <b>intended</b> <b>targets,</b> and an infrared homing (IR) terminal seeker to image and aim at the attack target.|$|R
50|$|Remote Sprint Launchers were {{established}} around the MSR main complex {{in order to}} place missile launchers closer to their <b>intended</b> <b>targets,</b> and thus reduce the flight range to the targets.
