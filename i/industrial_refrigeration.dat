25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>refrigeration</b> systems, {{most of the}} world uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>refrigeration</b> systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was very important because many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E

25|$|Because of ammonia's {{vaporization}} properties, it is {{a useful}} refrigerant. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in <b>industrial</b> <b>refrigeration</b> applications and hockey rinks because of its high energy efficiency and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern vapor-compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators. The Kalina cycle, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the International Space Station in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.|$|E
25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for <b>industrial</b> <b>refrigeration</b> in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E

2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>refrigeration</b> systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{utilization}} of waste heat from <b>industrial</b> ammonia <b>refrigeration</b> plants for hot water preparation. Two major ways {{of increasing the}} utilized waste heat are described and analyzed - increasing and stabilisation of condensing temperature above the normal level and using a heat pump with ammonia or refrigerant R 134 a. A definition of heating coefficient of performance is generalized. Its value {{can be used for}} energy, economic and environmental evaluation. A method for its determination by refrigeration plant working with increased condensing temperature is set. The connection of heat pumps to the basic refrigeration plant and the impact of different arrangements on heating COP are analyzed. The impact is described by coefficients whose values were determined analytically and confirmed for R 134 a by experimental measurements. Results are presented by a number of diagrams and graphs that also enables to choose the most appropriate solution for given experiments - quantity and temperature of hot water. The obtained results can be used for further optimization of heat pumps and refrigeration plant construction generally.

40|$|This paper compares HFC 404 A and two {{possible}} hydrocarbon substitutes HC 290 (propane) and HC 1270 (propylene) in condensation inside a commercial brazed {{plate heat exchanger}} (BPHE) at saturation temperatures between 25 and 40 [*]°C. The effects of saturation temperature (pressure), refrigerant mass flux, and vapour super-heating on heat transfer and hydraulic performances are investigated. The transition between gravity dominated and forced convection condensation occurs at a mass flux around 20 [*]kg[*]m− 2 [*]s− 1. In forced convection condensation a doubling of the refrigerant mass flux produces a 30 % enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient. The condensation heat transfer coefficients of super-heated vapour are 5 – 10 % {{higher than those of}} saturated vapour. Propane and propylene exhibit condensation heat transfer coefficients 25 – 45 % higher and frictional pressure drops similar to those of HFC 404 A under comparable operating conditions.

40|$|The United States {{and other}} {{countries}} model the emissions of hyrdofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) used as substitutes for chemicals that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. This modeling is performed in part to fulfill commitments made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). HFCs and PFCs are two classes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) identified {{in a variety of}} GHG emissions accounting (inventory) schemes as well as within international treaties designed to limit emissions of GHGs. Although {{only a small percentage of}} the total emissions of greenhouse gases, HFCs and PFCs are of concern due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, high global warming potentials, and importance to a wide variety of industries. Furthermore, as the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) is phased out, internationally under the Montreal Protocol and in the U. S. under Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, emissions of HFCs and PFCs are expected to grow significantly. Emissions of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes to ODSs come from numerous sources, including the following <b>industrial</b> sectors: <b>refrigeration</b> and air-conditioning equipment, solvent cleaning, the manufacturing and use of foam products, aerosol propellants, fire extinguishing, and sterilization. For each sector, a separate methodology is applied to model emissions from a variety of end-use sources. The authors will present the methodology used by the U. S.

The authors will also review the methodologies employed in different industrial sectors and what data is required to accurately estimate emissions. Techniques for correlating results from “bottom-up ” modeling with “top-down” information will be discussed.
