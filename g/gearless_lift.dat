40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Mantenimiento Industrial) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electromecánica, 2015. This {{report was}} {{produced}} at AZMONTS. A {{to develop the}} mechanical design of an elevator car frame and its components, in a more productive manner, so the company can decrease costs and improve its sales. The project stems from the need to bring to market an elevator lift with affordable production costs and with special conditions {{to comply with the}} provisions of the 7600 Law on Equal Opportunities and international regulations concerning the manufacture and installation of electric lifts per UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The lack of national production of elevator components requires the company AZMONT S. A. to import the elevator components from Spain. However, this report proves that the company’s production of elevator components in this country can benefit the company, making it more competitive in the elevator market in Costa Rica, as well as in {{other countries in the region}} where the company operates. The project variables are defined as: Cabin size, elevator speed, drive system and elevator path. During the practice, different types of elevator car frames were used and it was determined that the most appropriate model is the backpacks type. Three possible models were analyzed, but it was found one in particular met the minimum safety factors established by UNE EN 81 - 1 and ASME 17. 1. The model was based on appropriate and duly verified calculations. The project includes the selection of the suspension rope, <b>gearless</b> <b>lift</b> motor, car and counterweight guide rails and speed governor. The elevator car frame design proposal includes the cost benefit of developing its approach compared to products imported by the company AZMONT S. A. study. Once the project was finished the design of the elevator car frame plans were delivered to the Engineering Department of the company.

50|$|The {{building}} is of reinforced concrete construction, and was {{state of the}} art in its construction methods at the time - being clad with a curtain wall in opaque dark green glass spandrel panels framed by orange metal uprights. With its original commercial use in mind it featured an advanced elevator system for its day - four Otis Autotronic <b>gearless</b> <b>lifts</b> (also used in St. Andrew House on Sauchiehall Street) which were capable of responding to the traffic flow within the building at specific times of the day. The {{building is}} electrically heated and was also intended to feature a restaurant on the ground floor which the University later turned into a student refectory.|$|R
