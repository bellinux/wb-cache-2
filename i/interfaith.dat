5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual <b>interfaith</b> service—the first <b>interfaith</b> service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; {{their union}} was {{controversial}} {{because he was}} a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal. The families of the two eventually overcame their opposition and accepted the <b>interfaith</b> union, the first ever celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire. The couple had five children: Felix (who died in infancy), Augustine, Francis, Guillaume and Marie, all raised as Catholics.|$|E

5|$|Fakih {{was made}} the Minister of Religious Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet and sworn in on 3 April 1952, {{which led to}} him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta.

The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in Medan. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.|$|E

5|$|Although {{popular with}} groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, {{was a former}} singer and came from a musically {{inclined}} family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye {{while he waited for}} Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit <b>interfaith</b> marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding.|$|E
