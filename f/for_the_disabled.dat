5|$|At his funeral, Stansfield's widow Marie {{had an idea}} {{to set up the}} Adam Stansfield Foundation, {{which by}} the fourth anniversary of his death had raised over £150,000. It works in {{offering}} children football in Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire, the three counties in which he played professionally, as well as increasing opportunities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled</b> {{to take part in the}} sport. The foundation also aims to increase awareness of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the doors are step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach the seating area.

5|$|In 1970, Abebe began {{training}} for wheelchair-athlete archery competitions. In July, he competed in archery and table tennis at the Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games in London.

5|$|On March 22, 1969, Abebe was paralysed as {{a result}} of a car accident. Although he regained some upper-body mobility, he never walked again.

5|$|After the war ended, Sam took up {{an offer}} from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University. In Glasgow, the Currans, {{together}} with a few friends, set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan {{was a member of}} the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled were always at the forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Disabled</b> and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, the Riding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Disabled</b> Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to {{join the}} Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at Hartpury College in Hartpury, Gloucester, in England in July that year. At this event, her first {{international}} competition, she did well enough {{to qualify for the}} 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre at Sha Tin, she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class Ia).

5|$|Livingstone {{sought to}} remove the pigeons from Trafalgar Square; he tried to evict seed sellers and {{introduced}} hawks to scare the pigeons off. He pedestrianised {{the north side of}} the Square, transforming it into a public space with a cafe, public toilets, and a lift <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled.</b> He introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, and revived London's free anti-racism music festival, now called , later attributing London's 35% decrease in racist attacks to this and other anti-racist policies. Continuing his support for LGBT rights, in 2001 he set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen as a step towards the Civil Partnership Act 2004.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February, {{the victorious}} British fleet and its prizes entered the bay. Jervis ordered the three frigates—Emerald, , and , of 40 and 32 guns respectively—to search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled</b> flagship, Santisima Trinidad, {{which had been}} towed from the battle. Two smaller craft—Bonne-Citoyenne, a {{corvette}} of 20 guns, and the 14-gun sloop —joined the frigates. The British squadron on 20 February sighted Santissima Trinidad under tow by a large frigate and {{in the company of}} a brig. Berkeley, considering the small squadron under his command insufficient, declined to engage and eventually the Spanish ships sailed from sight. The 32-gun , while cruising alone, later located Santissima Trinidad and engaged her but the out-gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled</b> in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled,</b> and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled</b> and elderly.|$|E
5|$|There are 24 vending {{stands in}} the {{corridor}} area behind the stands, with a selection of different snacks, light meals, and beverages. Other facilities include exhibition space, 330 toilets for men, 120 for women, and six <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disabled.</b> Pre-match and half-time activities take place behind the terracing of the Northern Stand. This area is called Ståplatstorget ("The terracing square"), and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support's supporter centre. At the supporter centre, fans can buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables. Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches. To further motivate spectators to come early, pre-match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget.|$|E
