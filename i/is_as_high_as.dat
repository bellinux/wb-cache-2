5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Rumination syndrome, or Merycism, is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E
5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 75% in countries such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while in countries such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E

The lead concentration is above 0.05 micrograms per liter in most sites and can be up to 6.4 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol and Native Americans: 12% of {{the deaths}} among American Indians and Alaska Natives are alcohol-related. In some {{continental}} Amerindian tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1000 live births. Deaths due to alcohol among American Indians are more common in men and among Northern Plains Indians, but Alaska Natives showed the least incidence of death. Existing data do indicate, however, that Alaska Native alcohol-related death rates are almost nine times the national average, and approximately 7% of all Alaska Native deaths are alcohol related.|$|E
25|$|The Inner Circle {{refers to}} English as it {{originally}} took shape and was {{spread across the}} world in the first diaspora. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and South Africa, and some of the Caribbean territories. English is the native language or mother tongue of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, about 53% of the {{population}} were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for {{the last twenty years}} both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zürich). In 1970, only 2% of Zürich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group of people, being between 24 and 44 years old, this <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> one in every third person.|$|E
25|$|Globally, the GCC {{countries}} are situated {{among the top}} twenty countries where non-nationals outnumber national citizens. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE are among the top ten countries accommodating the largest migrant populations in the world, occupying fourth and fifth place respectively. In Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, {{the majority of the}} population comprises foreign laborers and in the latter two countries this number <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 80%. Furthermore, 95% of the workers active in the domestic and construction sectors are migrant workers. As of 2013, it was estimated that approximately 18 million legal migrants resided in the GCC region. Over the last few years the number of migrants residing in the GCC has increased considerably. The Gulf Research Center defines non-nationals as individuals having citizenship of a country outside the GCC region. People who are lacking any recognized citizenship are also included in this definition. GCC countries have further been criticized for systemic human rights violations perpetrated against migrant workers living within the borders of the GCC member states.|$|E
25|$|Otomi is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} single language, although its many dialects are not all mutually intelligible. The language classification of the SIL International's Ethnologue considers Otomi to be a cover term for nine separate Otomi languages and assigns a different ISO code {{to each of these}} nine varieties. Currently Otomi varieties are spoken collectively by c. 239,000 speakers — some 5 to 6 percent of whom are monolingual. Because of recent migratory patterns, small populations of Otomi speakers can be found in new locations throughout Mexico and in the United States. The Otomi languages are vigorous in some areas, with children acquiring the language through natural transmission (e.g. in the Mezquital Valley of Hidalgo and in the Highlands). However three varieties are now considered moribund: those of Ixtenco (Tlaxcala state), Santiago Tilapa and Acazulco (Mexico state), and Cruz del Palmar (Guanajuato state). In some municipalities the level of monolingualism in Otomi <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 22.3% (Huehuetla, Hidalgo) or 13.1% (Texcatepec, Veracruz). Monolingualism is normally significantly higher among women than among men.|$|E
