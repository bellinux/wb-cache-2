40|$|Trash racks are {{set before}} inlet sumps of a pumping station with wet-pits {{in order to}} block trash. The flow fields before and behind the trash rack were numerically {{simulated}} and flow fields in the <b>inlet</b> <b>sump</b> were calculated using the simulated velocity distribution of the section behind the trash rack as the inlet boundary condition. Local head loss of trash-barriering increases {{with the increase of}} blockage ratio of the trash rack. When waterweeds block upper part of the trash rack, flow pattern behind the trash rack will be extremely turbulent, flow velocity of lower part of inlet section of <b>inlet</b> <b>sump</b> will increase, flow velocity of the upper part will decrease, and even backflow appears, which will deteriorate the flow pattern and increase head loss in the <b>inlet</b> <b>sump.</b> Trash-barriering has little effect on velocity distribution of impeller inlet section. Trash-barriering will not only increase head and power of the pump but also decrease the flow. For the example of the pumping station: when blockage ratios of the trash racks are 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7, operating cost will increase by 13 %~ 43 % than that of without trash racks. Therefore, the trash rack should be cleaned up timely...|$|E
40|$|Exfiltration {{stormwater}} treatment systems (STSs) {{offer the}} stormwater industry a versatile and effective method of combined stormwater treatment, detention and retention. They are in themselves self-contained treatment trains {{with the following}} components and functions: • GPT or pit baskets – for pre-filtering. • <b>Inlet</b> <b>sump</b> – for maintenance and eduction. • HydroCon permeable pipes – promotes sediment retention within the pipe, chemical precipitation as water exfiltrates through the pipe wall and mainly is a maintainable method to deliver water into the filter media. • Filtering media matrix – promotes filtering, adsorption and microbial digestion and transformation of pollutants. • Surface surcharge (where required) – for detention. As the systems rely on simple materials such as pipes, pits and filter media, they can be designed into any shape or size. In the Kiama CBD, Grasmere and Ashgrove residential subdivisions in Western Sydney, Exfiltration STSs are designed as basins with surcharge. In the Elambra residential estate in Gerringong, the sand filter is a linear device that lies adjacent to a perimeter road within the road easement. This flexibility in shape and size confers excellent versatility...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWater for irrigation, {{domestic}} and industrial supply {{as well for}} some power generation is normally drawn directly from rivers or from reservoir through sumps. The flow at the pump section sump may have large effects on the pump performances and the operating conditions. The flow patterns in the sump are mainly determined by the shape and scale of the sump. However, it's not always possible to design a sump pump to provide uniform and stable flow to pumps, due to site constraints. For example in some cases air entraining (surface and subsurface vortex) occurs. These vortices may reduce pump performances and lead to increase plant operating costs. It becomes essential to investigate the pump sump to avoid these non uniformities inlet flow problems. Two approaches (experimental and numerical) are generally followed for such investigation. The numerical approach usually used solves the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with a near-wall turbulence model. In the validation of this numerical model, {{emphasis was placed on}} the prediction of the number, the location, the size and the strength of the various types of vortices. A previous study done by the same hauteur of this one [1], has shown the influence on a single type of mesh with different cell numbers, different intake pipe depths and different water levels, for two turbulence models closure. The present paper mainly focuses, first, on the effect of pump intake location in the sump and secondly on the effect of several inlet velocity gradients at <b>inlet</b> <b>sump</b> section...|$|E
40|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{in the analysis}} of scrubber data is that of separating the physical effects, such as mass transfer, from the physico-chemical effects, such as reaction rates. This is especially true for the absorbtion of nitrogen tetroxide in the various liquids that were tested in the NASA-Kennedy Space Center Hypergolic Toxic Scrubber Program. A fruitful approach to correlating the data for outlet concentrations was to treat the overall absorbtion as a pseudo first-order absorbtion equation. This approach provided a method for normalizing the data to constant <b>inlet</b> concentration, constant <b>sump</b> liquor condition, and constant scrubbing time, and permitted evaluation of the test and fluid parameters that affected both absorbtion rate and scrubbing time. The analysis indicated that scrubber performance may be improved by optimizing liquor concentrations and liquor flowrate distributions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of standard sumps as a best management practice (BMP) in treating stormwater runoff, a baffle {{was designed to be}} installed as a retrofit in standard sumps. The retrofit is a porous baffle called "SAFL Baffle". The effect of the SAFL Baffle on the performance of the standard sumps was assessed by conducting laboratory tests on small scale as well as full scale straight flow-through standard sumps equipped with the baffle. In addition, a number of tests were conducted to determine the performance of standard sumps with the SAFL Baffle when the baffle is clogged with debris like trash and vegetation. Furthermore, the performance of two other configurations of the baffle was studied: (1) the SAFL Baffle in a sump with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the inlet pipe, and (2) the SAFL Baffle in a sump with some water entering the sump through an overhead <b>inlet</b> grate. Standard <b>sumps</b> equipped with the SAFL Baffle were evaluated using two metrics: (1) How well the system captures sediment during low flow conditions (Removal Efficiency Testing), and (2) how well the system retains the previously captured sediment during high flow conditions (Washout Testing). The results of the tests showed that the SAFL Baffle dissipates the energy of water entering the sump and as a result, at low flow rates, it captures sediment better than a standard sump with no baffle. More importantly, at high flow rates, the washout of the previously captured sediment reduces to near zero...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} {{summarized in}} this paper included the testing of three representative stormwater control devices that were located at storm drainage inlets. The two proprietary devices utilized screening and filtering (using filter fabric and a coarser mesh). A conventional catchbasin <b>inlet,</b> having a <b>sump,</b> was also tested for comparison. These devices were monitored in Stafford Township, NJ, to evaluate their removal effectiveness for stormwater pollutants. Twelve paired samples collected at each device represented composite inflow and outflow stormwater. The samples were split into filtered and unfiltered components for extensive analyses of conventional and toxic pollutants. The experimental design was capable of identifying significant pollutant removals of at least 15 to 50 % at a 95 % confidence level, depending on the pollutant. The only significant pollutant removals were found during tests of a conventional catchbasin having a suitable sump. The median removal rates were about 30 % for suspended solids, about 40 % for turbidity, about 15 % for color, and about 20 % for total solids. No other pollutants {{were found to be}} significantly reduced. However, the coarse screened inlet device was found to significantly reduce the discharges of trash and other large debris. Unfortunately, flows passing through trapped material caught on the screen had increased concentrations of suspended solids and volatile solids, probably due to washing of decomposing large organic material through the screen. The filter fabrics tested in the laboratory showed about 50 % removals for suspended solids and COD, but they rapidly clogged, significantly shortening their run times and minimizing any benefit from their use. This research was conducted in partial fulfillment of cooperative agreement no. CR 819573 under the sponsorship of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency...|$|R
