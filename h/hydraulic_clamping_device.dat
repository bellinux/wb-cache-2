40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to acquaint the sheet metal worker with the {{numerous}} possibilities that stretch forming offers as an economical supplementary and alternative process as compared to deep drawing. A number of cost saving effects {{can be achieved by}} suitably designed multi-purpose tooling. In addition to the higher precision of the shape and the higher stability of stretch formed components it is above all the saving in sheet material for the component, the simpler tool design and the lesser expenditure for test runs that help reduce production costs. Modern stretch forming technologies do not need separate (mostly <b>hydraulic)</b> <b>clamping</b> <b>devices</b> so that the process can be used on widely varying types of presses. It is also suitable, as will be illustrated by the solutions discussed, for use on multi-station presses and press lines. The stroke rate per minute is the same as in deep drawing...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of body parts {{starts with the}} step of sheet metal forming. The single parts, produced at the press shop, are put into <b>clamping</b> <b>devices</b> in order to align and fix them. The fixation takes part before further operations, such as joining, can be carried out. In order to simulate the process chain of add-on body parts realistically, the clamping process (closing the <b>clamping</b> <b>device)</b> {{has to be taken}} into account [1]. The stationary surfaces of a <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> are called "passive surfaces", whereas the movable surfaces are "'active surfaces". If the clamping process is calculated by means of active surfaces, their positions need to be measured in the state of a closed <b>clamping</b> <b>device.</b> While the passive surfaces of a body construction device can be measured with high reproducibility, the measurement of active surfaces is impracticable in the state of a closed device. This is due to the loss of accessibility. Furthermore, if the parts to be clamped or the position of the <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> differ from their designed position, the assembly works, such as a flat spring against the <b>clamping</b> <b>device,</b> in all spatial directions. The active surface does not reach the position which has been measured before. In order to take these facts in clamping simulations into account, the end position of the active surfaces should be known. A <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> concept, based on a measuring probe for optical measurement systems, has been developed. It is possible to determine the position of active surfaces with high reproducibility while the parts are clamped. It can be shown, that the presented <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> concept contributes to significantly better results of clamping simulations. Thus a better starting basis can be offered for further simulations along the process chain...|$|R

40|$|When {{multifunctional}} pipeline repair machinery (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. <b>Clamping</b> <b>device</b> and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|R
