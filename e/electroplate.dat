5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an <b>electroplate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper <b>electroplate</b> in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E

25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal <b>electroplate,</b> and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional jacketed bullets in price.|$|E

His major works included the great west window of Dunfermline Abbey and the scheme for St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by Daniel Cottier (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin.

40|$|Ni-P {{coatings}} {{on carbon}} steel were plated by a mechanically assisted <b>electroplating</b> technique, which combines the conventional <b>electroplating</b> technique with mechanical ball-rolling. The mechanical ball-rolling {{was conducted by}} vibrating the sample being plated with glass balls on it. For comparison, the conventional Ni-P <b>electroplating</b> technique without mechanical ball-rolling was also used to deposit Ni-P coatings under the same coating conditions as those adopted in the mechanically assisted <b>electroplating.</b> The experimental {{results show that the}} Ni-P coatings <b>electroplated</b> with mechanical assistance were smoother in surface, thinner in thickness, harder in hardness, more positive in corrosion potential, and greater in polarization resistance in comparison with the Ni-P coatings <b>electroplated</b> without mechanical assistance. The mechanical ball-rolling made the Ni-P coatings crystallized in-situ during the coating process, thereby avoiding crystallization-induced cracking, which was observed during the crystallization of the amorphous Ni-P coatings <b>electroplated</b> without mechanical assistance.
