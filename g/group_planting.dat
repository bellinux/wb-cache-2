50|$|LiveWired {{began as}} a small group (Bible study) held in an {{apartment}} in Columbus, Ohio in 2004. After meeting together on a weekly regular basis and watching members come and go, in 2005 David Peregrina proposed the concept of small <b>group</b> <b>planting.</b> Peregrina, co-leader of the group, met up with Aaron Bohn {{who at the time}} was the small group leader and Brendan Phillips, another co-leader of the small group to discuss the concept. After a year of praying it was decided to officially start the project.|$|E
50|$|The Flecker Botanic Gardens is {{bounded by}} Collins Avenue and McCormack, Goodwin and MacDonnell streets. Some plantings {{in this area}} need to be {{considered}} with respect to their possible age. The corner of Collins Avenue and McCormack Street along the western boundary has a <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> including two very large hoop pines Araucaria cunninghamii, a Cook pine Araucaria columnaris, a sausage tree Kigelia pinnata, and a large fig tree Ficus spp. The association of these species in botanical gardens was not uncommon in the late 19th century, as at Queens Park, Maryborough.|$|E
50|$|The regular routine was {{to start}} off {{discussing}} what everyone {{was going through the}} past week. After sharing, the group would spend some time in music and worship, a short message presented by the leader, and finally a discussion on the topic that was presented. Groups would be split by gender to avoid situations of individuals feeling as though they couldn't share problems they were having without feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable. The concept for the group was to keep the same routine but to add a formula for a more direct discipleship. The leader would pick every other week to have a small group member present the topic. The idea was that by spending time doing research and reading the Bible the member would have an opportunity to have one-on-one spiritual growth as well as the group discussion to help the individual in their process of spiritual maturity. Another major concept of small <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> was to continue the process until a member seemed fit to be put in a leadership position in a small group, similar to the idea of an internship. Once the member was ready, the small group would split into two groups, one with the current leader and the other with the new leader. This would provide an opportunity for both groups to grow, but still maintain the intimate and comfortable setting. The final concept of small <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> was what prevented LiveWired from becoming church plants. The idea was to educate individuals on material from the Bible to empower the individual to go back and serve in their home church. The belief was that church was not a place for the believer to be fed by the church, but for the believer to feed the church. In essence it was about giving to those around you and helping those in need.|$|E

50|$|The art of saikei {{overlaps}} bonsai to some extent, as bonsai {{includes a}} tradition of multiple-tree plantings. Saikei has a much stronger emphasis on the shape {{and structure of the}} landscape than does bonsai, and has much greater freedom in the layout and materials of that landscape. Trees can appear singly or in groups at any suitable spot in the landscape, even on the sides and tops of rocks representing mountains or hills. There is no rule to mass the trees together in a contiguous unit in a saikei. Bonsai multiple-tree styles, on the other hand, have very simple landscapes, usually a simple plateau or slight dome of soil beneath the trees. The bonsai plantings are generally developed to display a unified silhouette involving all the trees, in which they produce a single foliage mass behind and to the left and right of the trunks. In bonsai, trees completely dominate the <b>group</b> <b>planting,</b> while in saikei, trees simply decorate the saikei landscape.|$|E

Methods: Assessment of pranic treated tomatoes against the control group were done for their quality and quantity by measuring the overall yield, plant height, diameter of the stem, flowers, flowers per truss and also shelf life of tomatoes. Findings: Increase in height of 18. 5 % was noticed in pranic <b>group</b> <b>plants</b> as compared to control group. Also, pranic <b>group</b> <b>plants</b> had 12 % more stem diameter than control group. Additionally, pranic <b>group</b> <b>plants</b> had 31. 7 % more flowers per plant when compared to control. When group-wise yield was verified, Pranic group yielded significantly with 31 % more than control group. In addition, pranic treatment played a very useful role in controlling the fruit weight loss, shrinkage, titrable acidity and total soluble solids content of tomatoes during storage at room and refrigerated temperatures.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} superior tree quality and comparable tree growth of oaks planted in group compared with row planting. However, a comparative assessment of the potential future crop trees (PFCTs) between group and row planting is still lacking. Here, we compared the density and tree quality of planted oaks and other naturally regenerated trees between group and row planting. We assessed whether the distribution of PFCTs fulfills the goal of maintaining a spatially homogenous distribution of such crop trees at the stand level by geospatial analysis. We selected 10 group and row planting stands that were either 14 to 15 or 21 to 22 years old. Tree density in group plantings {{was significantly higher than}} in row plantings. Stand basal area was higher in row planting in younger stands but comparable to <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> in older stands. The proportion of trees with straight stems and monopodial crowns was higher in groups than in rows. The density and species’ richness of the PFCTs was significantly higher but the number of oak PFCTs was lower in group than in row plantings. In group plantings, naturally regenerated PFCTs contributed to 43 % of total PFCTs, but to only 19 % in row plantings. Also, the spatial distribution of PFCTs in group plantings was more uniform than in row plantings. Uniform and homogeneous distribution of the PFCTs in <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> stands can facilitate design and conduct of tending operations. Thus, the <b>group</b> <b>planting</b> technique offers not only cost savings in the establishment phase but also additional benefits, including spreading of risks through increased tree species diversity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the damage characteristics induced by winter freezing of evergreen broad-leaved trees distributed in urban area of warm temperate forest zone, which are gaining increased interest recently as climate change. The results of the study indicated that, as for ‘stem injury’, Camellia japonica Linné (59. 6 %) had the weakest damage, while Ternstroemia gymnanthera Sprague (83. 3 %) had the most severe damage. By the visual evaluation of freezing injury according to the characteristics of plantations environment, the observations of single planting (p< 0. 01) in planting method had weaker damage than those of <b>group</b> <b>planting,</b> the observations of under tree (p< 0. 001), plain (p< 0. 001), and organic matter plenty (p< 0. 05) in plantations characteristics had significant differences with relatively weaker damage than the observations of open space, slop, and scarcity, respectively. Tree height (- 0. 432) and crown width (- 0. 470) among growth factors were negatively correlated with the severity of damage, respectively. Therefore, the selection of tree species is vital for the successful creation of these urban forested area by making consideration...|$|E

40|$|In {{southwest}} China, {{agricultural land}} and forest land are traditionally {{considered to be}} separate. Howev-er, in addition to large-scale government-orchestrated plantations schemes, there is tremendous poten-tial for planting trees on farms to improve agro-ecosystem mosaics. This {{can be done with}} single trees, with <b>group</b> <b>planting,</b> or through small-scale woodlots with one or more indigenous species. Agroforests can also increase agricultural productivity, and supplement farmer incomes through the sale of fruit, nuts, fuelwood, and timber. Trees on farms can alleviate fuelwood and timber shortfalls. The potential erosion and runoff control benefits provided by a mix of appropriately selected and placed trees can contribute to watershed and biodiversity conservation objectives. These benefits are more significant on farms than in plantations. ICRAF is testing and developing suitable tree-planting and agro-forestry schemes with farmers and for-esters in southwest China on several levels: through assistance in selecting species and improving nursery technology to raise high-quality seeds and saplings; by research on domestication and species phenology; with training in management and marketing; by documenting experiences to inform policy; and through supporting environmental education and rehabilitation programmes.
