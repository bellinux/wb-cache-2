He decided [...] "to let it all hang out by singing about {{some of his own}} little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets." [...] He explained: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal".

After several delays, the album Way Beyond Blue was released on 30 September. There were 12 tracks, several of which had appeared on previous EPs and as b-sides to singles. On the background of the successful album, there were problems behind the scenes. Matthews and Roberts relationship broke down, with Roberts ending it and seeing someone else within days. The duo sought to keep the band together despite the problems, and they found a way to continue working together. Warner Bros. Records had intended to release [...] "Lost Cat" [...] from Way Beyond Blue in the United States, but due to problems at the record label this didn't occur.|$|E
500|$|Pegg {{was fired}} prior {{to work on}} their first studio album, Way Beyond Blue, while Ieuan was {{replaced}} with Aled Richards shortly afterwards. This new line-up remained {{for the rest of the}} lifetime of the band. The single [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>to</b> Answer For" [...] received radio airplay and became the band's first top 40 single in the UK Singles Chart in September 1996. Their breakout success came at the start of 1998 with the International Velvet album and the release of the single [...] "Mulder and Scully" [...] some two weeks apart. The album went to number one in the album chart, and sold more than 900,000 copies being certified triple platinum by British Phonographic Industry, while the single reached number 3 in the singles chart, the highest any Catatonia single would chart.|$|E

500|$|He {{signed a}} new one-year deal with Vale in July 2011, after Micky Adams {{returned}} to the club as manager. After scoring five goals in his first nine games he admitted that [...] "He [...] is the only manager that can control me so I think he gets {{the best out of}} me." [...] However, on 19 September he was given a fourteen-day suspension by the club for 'a serious breach of club discipline', after he missed a day of training without any warning and then 'reported in unfit to carry out his duties' the following day; Adams said [...] "I'm bitterly disappointed in him." [...] He was also placed on the transfer list, as Adams stated [...] "he's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do" [...] before Roberts could think about a return to the first team. He made his return on 24 October, when Adams named him on the bench for a league clash with Bristol Rovers.|$|E

[...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E
500|$|Matthews {{said that}} they did not have any {{particular}} influences in their music. However, she said that her family had always been singing along to BBC Radio 2. She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they wouldn't have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as [...] "Road Rage" [...] which references emotional anger. The line [...] "If it turns to blue, what are we going to do?" [...] in the single [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>A</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>To</b> Answer For" [...] from Way Beyond Blue references a pregnancy test. Other works from International Velvet were compared to poetry by Katharine Viner in The Guardian.|$|E

In Britain, the upbeat side, [...] "Girls", was promoted as the topside and reached number 23 in the British charts in September 1961. In the United States it was flipped over with [...] "I've <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> of Things <b>to</b> Do" [...] as the topside, but despite heavy promotion {{it failed to}} become a hit, peaking just outside the Hot 100 at number 109.|$|R
500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E

The two begin the program by introducing the [...] "very special" [...] episode and, after the episode aired, conclude it by introducing a series of musical numbers.

500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E
