500|$|Unreal Tournament {{received}} Eurogamer's {{first ever}} perfect score, who also named {{it one of}} the best games of 1999. Launch editor John Bye chose the shooter as the game of the past decade (1999–2009) and said, [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is one of the few}} games in the early days of Eurogamer that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back to months after I'd finished reviewing it, a game that I played to unwind after a long day playing other games. Whether it was trying to break the one-minute barrier in the speed running mayhem of Assault mode, battling back and forth amongst the alleyways of Domination, or dropping shrapnel shells at people's feet with the wonderfully chunky flak cannon in a fast and furious free-for-all deathmatch, Unreal Tournament was an endless source of entertainment." [...] In 2004, Unreal Tournament was inducted into the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way.

The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you.

500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what you were playing earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.'

They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way."

Maki was appointed Taylor’s mentor and after initially looking at contemporary Japanese gardens, she realised, [...] "I became very interested in contemporary architecture in Japan.

2500|$|Gonzaga {{dominated}} the art department of imperial theatres for over thirty years, surviving three monarchs: Catherine II, Paul I and Alexander I. He decorated coronations of Paul (1797), Alexander I (1801) and Nicholas I (1826) while his lifelong benefactor Yusupov administered all three events. Gonzaga became a trusted consultant to heiress and later empress Maria Fyodorovna, Golitsyn and Yusupov families and diversified into decorating palace interiors and landscape design. Fyodor Glinka described Gonzaga's three-dimensional trompe-l'œil folly in Pavlovsk Park (1815): [...] "What {{is a reality}} and what is a dream? ... Convinced at the existence of what was before me, <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> further and further forward. But suddenly something strange began to happen to my eyes: {{it was as if}} an invisible curtain of some sort was descending upon these objects and swallowing them from sight ... At length I began to quarrel with my own eyes and my head began to spin, and I hastened to be gone from this realms of charms and magic!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me, {{as far as}} I could recollect, {{there was only a}} chair here and there and yonder, five or six of them {{scattered}} over this territory, and I thought maybe after I found that chair I might find the next one. Well, I did. And I found another and another and another. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> around on my hands and knees, having those sudden collisions, and finally when I banged into another chair I almost lost my temper. And I raised up, garbed as I was, not for public exhibition, right {{in front of a mirror}} fifteen or sixteen feet high.|$|E
60|$|I set {{out from}} Sligo about six in the evening, walking slowly, for it was an evening of great beauty; but though I was well into Slish Wood by bed-time, I could not sleep, not from the {{discomfort}} of the dry rock I had chosen for my bed, but from my fear of the wood-ranger. Somebody had told me, though I {{do not think it}} could have been true, that he went his round at some unknown hour. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> over what I should say if I was found and could not think of anything he would believe. However, I could watch my island in the early dawn and notice the order of the cries of the birds.|$|E

5000|$|The Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during {{qualifying}} for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: [...] "I {{was already on}} pole, ... and <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> <b>going.</b> Suddenly <b>I</b> was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car.

60|$|Nasmyth's {{story had}} laid {{hold of my}} {{imagination}} like one small, intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> it <b>going</b> during Gordon-Nasmyth's intermittent appearances in England.

Something--out beyond there--is calling me, always has been calling me ever since I was a tiny girl and found out {{there was a big}} world far away from Racicot. And it always seemed to me that I {{would find a way to}} it some day. That was why <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> to school long after the other girls stopped. Mother thought I'd better stop home; she said too much book {{learning}} would make me discontented and too different from the people I had to live along. But Father let me go; he understood; he said I was like him when he was young. I learned everything and read everything I could. It seems to me as if I had been walking along a narrow pathway all my life. And now it seems as if a gate were opened before me and I can pass through into a wider world. It isn't the luxury and the pleasure or the fine house and dresses that tempt me, though the people here think so--even Mother thinks so. But it is not. It's just that something seems to be in my grasp that I've always longed for, and I must go--Rob, I must go." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon I worked or wormed out of {{the pines}} into the thicket of scrub oaks, maples and aspens. The change was welcome. Not only did the slope {{lengthen}} out, but the light changed from gloom to gold. There was half a foot of scarlet, gold, bronze, red and purple leaves on the ground, and every step I made I kicked acorns about to rustle and roll. Bear sign was everywhere, tracks and trails and beds and scratches. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> down, and the farther down I got the lighter it grew, and more approaching a level. One glade was strangely luminous and beautiful with a blending of gold and purple light made by the sun shining through the leaves overhead down upon the carpet of leaves on the ground. Then I came into a glade {{that reminded me of}} Kipling's moonlight dance of the wild elephants. Here the leaves and fern were rolled and matted flat, smooth as if done by a huge roller. Bears and bears had lolled and slept and played there. A little below this glade was a place, shady and cool, where a seep of water came from under a bank. It looked like a herd of cattle had stamped the earth, only the tracks were bear tracks. Little ones no longer than a child's hand, and larger, up to huge tracks a foot long and almost as wide. Many were old, but some were fresh. This little spot smelled of bear so strongly that it reminded me of the bear pen in the Bronx Park Zoological Garden. I had been keen for sight of bear trails and scent of bear fur, but this was a little too much. I thought it was too much because the place was lonely and dark and absolutely silent. I went on down to the gully that ran {{down the middle of the}} canyon. It was more open here. The sun got through, and there were some big pines.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2011, Hart said, [...] "Well, when I wrote that book I {{was looking for the}} origins of percussion. So by writing that book <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back, you know? To the Mongols of the 11th century. Then I went back to the caves, and then the Neolithic, then the Paleolithic, and then when I reached the point where drums first started to appear, I thought, well, okay, where did that come from? And, it led me {{back to the beginning of}} time and space. The beginning of the universe. The Big Bang." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Nava {{spent two}} months in AAA. At that time he was quoted as saying, [...] "I know I have the talent and the ability, and I can keep playing at the next level," [...] he said.

5000|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Long Mitchell explains, [...] "The Tin Man is an iconic character ... It's a real throwback {{in a lot of}} ways. It's almost an Eastwood character. It's a guy who knows {{the difference between right and}} wrong. It's a very iconic Western character. When we made the list, Craig and <b>I,</b> we <b>kept</b> <b>going,</b> 'We need Neal.

It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons were exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told HitQuarters {{that they were still}} at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: [...] "There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop.

Critic Sean O'Hagan, writing in The Guardian, said of The Epilogue that [...] "It is a sombre and affecting photobook ... dense and rewarding ... At times, it makes for a painful read.

This next album that I got, I express a lot about my career and where I'm at. <b>I</b> just <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> with making the music that I make that hopefully pleases the fans. So I didn't change up anything. I just kind of stuck with my formula. I have a formula for picking out beats whether it was for the last album or this album, I start with picking out tracks and I just flow from the heart, whatever is on my mind.

60|$|I was {{now going}} at {{what seemed like}} a speed of ninety or a hundred miles an hour, with the wind rushing in between my teeth like water over a mill-dam, and I felt sure that if <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on <b>going</b> down that hill I should soon be {{whirling}} through space like a comet. The only way I could think of to save myself was to turn into some level place where the thing would stop, but not a crossroad did I pass; but presently I saw a little house standing back from the road, which seemed to hump itself a little at that place so as to be nearly level, and {{over the edge of the}} hump it dipped so suddenly that I could not see the rest of the road at all.|$|R

5000|$|Smith was {{introduced}} to darts around the age of 9 or 10 by his father. Smith told Patrick Chaplin in 2011, “The family lived in a big house {{in the country and}} I used to practice and practice.” He joined a darts team in the Dumfries pub league around the age of 16. His inspiration to improve was a local player named Joe Little at another Dumfries pub, The Hole I’ The Wa’ (The Hole in the Wall).“From the age of sixteen I would go into town to play darts. I met Joe Little in the pub and we played darts and he beat me. <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back and he kept beating me. I really wanted to beat him.

[...] He also spoke about writing the song, [...] "It's actually a completely original song that <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back to rewrite over and over again because, at first, the musician in me thought it was too simple in its structure... but then I realised that sometimes simplicity is the best way forward to keep things fun and hook-y." [...] Sebastian told The New Zealand Herald that it was based on songs he was hearing on the radio from the likes of David Guetta, and The Black Eyed Peas. [...] "I'm not reinventing the wheel, not at all. I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul album, but I went towards what you hear on the radio.

5000|$|Dan Wheldon {{finished}} second.

[...] However, Franchitti also had additional fuel, with 1.6 gallons remaining in his tank at the end of the race, even after taking a cool-down lap.

5000|$|Myers is a {{submarine}} pitcher, {{throwing the ball}} with his arm at or below his shoulder rather than above. When Myers was with the Tigers, Baseball Hall of Famer Al Kaline, then a broadcaster with the team, suggested that Myers experiment with the submarine style of pitching.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, the band revealed they spent two months writing and recording their third album with producer Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange in his recording studio in Lake Geneva, Switzerland.

"I would {{come in with a}} finished song, and he'd say, 'That's a good start. Now strip it down to the drums and start over.' The coolest thing about him is that not only has he been a huge, legendary producer, but he also is a legit, serious writer."Rolling Stone has said that the resulting disc is the band's brightest-sounding and poppiest yet and that it delivers Lange's mix of catchy hooks and punchy rhythms. Levine has also said about the album: [...] "Our first record was a reflection of my love for Stevie Wonder. With the second <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> back and forth between Prince and The Police. But there was no one on my mind for this album. It's just great pop." [...] In a separate interview, however, Levine said that the album was influenced by Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye. The album artwork was revealed on July 1, 2010. The cover photo for the album was taken by 19-year-old photographer Rosie Hardy, who also serves as the model in the photo.
