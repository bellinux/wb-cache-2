40|$|Medical {{video is}} {{characterized}} by small interframe variations and the representation in gray scale. Traditional compression techniques such as MPEG 2 cannot fully exploit these issues and makes other approaches, such as Wavelet-based coders much more interesting. We present in this paper several improvements in the entropy encoder of a 3 D-FWT encoder: 3 D-Conscious Run-Length, which exploits the high presence of zeros in the decorrelated sequence, an <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>coding</b> of the chains of zeros generated in the previous step {{and the application of}} arithmetic coding instead of Huffman. We have evaluated these enhancements improving the compression ratio of the original 3 D-FWT encoder between 40 % and 70 %. We have also compared our scheme with MPEG 2 and EZW (which is also based on the FWT), obtaining better compression ratios, up to 119 % and 46 % respectively, for the same PSNR. 1...|$|E

5000|$|The {{support for}} {{hexadecimal}} {{in this context}} is more recent, so older browsers might have problems displaying characters referenced with hexadecimal numbers—but they will probably have a problem displaying Unicode characters above code point 255 anyway. To ensure better compatibility with older browsers, it is still a common practice to convert the <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>code</b> point into a decimal value (for example [...] instead of [...] ).|$|R

5000|$|Marc Rémillard is {{most notorious}} for his skills in {{composition}} of fully original material. He {{works with the}} music composition software Renoise, which is peculiar in its use of the old Tracker interface. The software is largely unheard of, {{in part because of}} its user-unfriendliness, since it uses a numeric interface and requires to some degree a basic understanding of <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>codes.</b> However, it allows for an absolute and detailed control of all sounds, instead of using the more usual sequencing technique.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not meant}} for regular users, the {{maintenance}} manual described a keyboard sequence to switch the 5100 into a maintenance mode. In this mode {{it was possible to}} read and write directly in RAM memory, video memory, CPU registers, interrupt vectors, clock counter, etc, using <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>codes</b> equivalent to assembly language. This allowed writing sophisticated programs directly into RAM. As this mode was a single-user system effectively running without an operating system, a determined user could manage the memory space and write stable multi-tasking programs using interrupts.|$|R
50|$|On the iPod, if {{damage or}} an error {{occurs in the}} {{hardware}} or the firmware, for example, if its files are deleted, a Sad iPod appears. This {{is similar to the}} Sad Mac, but instead of a Macintosh, there is an iPod, and there are no chimes of death. The icon also lacks a nose, and the frown is flipped horizontally. It also doesn't show <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>codes</b> indicating what problem occurred in the iPod. This error screen will not show up when a problem occurs in the newer iPods.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Cryptography, Steganography & Watermarking {{are three}} basic methods to protect data from {{unauthorized}} access. Cryptography & steganography are data hiding techniques {{which are used}} to send data securely while watermarking is used to give unique identity to data like image, audio & video. This paper concentrates on HTML steganography which uses HTML source code as cover text to hide data behind it. HTML steganography methods like use of null spaces, attribute order, attribute value enclosures, case of characters, <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>code</b> to hide data have some limitation like limited LEC(Largest Embedding Capacity) & law security. To remove this limitations better idea is to use relative links of HTML source code & Multi web-page embedment for embedding data in multiple web pages. That increases the LEC & security...|$|R
