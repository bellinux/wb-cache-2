BackgroundThe use of compartmental analysis allows a mathematical separation of tissues and organs to determine the concentration of activity in each fraction of interest. Biodistribution studies are expensive and difficult to carry out in humans, but such data can be obtained easily in rodents. Materials and methodsWe have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for scaling up activity concentration in each organ versus time. The mathematical model uses physiological parameters including organ volumes, blood flow rates, and vascular permabilities; the compartments (organs) are connected anatomically. This allows the use of scale-up techniques to predict new complex distribution in humans in each organ. ResultsThe concentration of the radiopharmaceutical in various organs was measured at different times. The temporal behavior of biodistribution of 153 Sm-EDTMP was modeled and drawn as a function of time. ConclusionsThe variation of pharmaceutical concentration in all organs is described with summation of 6 – 10 exponential terms and it approximates our experimental data with precision better than 2 %...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Systemic {{therapy with}} {{radionuclides}} {{may be used}} for the treatment of patients with painful skeletal metastases owing to its efficacy, low cost and low toxicity. Imported radionuclides for pain palliation, like Strontium- 89 are expensive; particularly for developing countries. In the Indian scenario, Samarium- 153 (Sm- 153) is produced in our own reactors and as a result, it is readily available and economical. AIM: We undertook this study to determine the efficacy and toxicity of single-dose Sm- 153 <b>ethylenediamine</b> <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>phosphonate</b> as a palliative treatment for painful skeletal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eightysix patients with painful skeletal metastases from various primaries, were treated with Sm- 153 EDTMP at a dose of 37 MBq/kg. The effects were evaluated according to change in visual analogue pain score, analgesic consumption, Karnofsky performance score, mobility score and blood count tests, conducted regularly for 16 weeks. STATISTICS: Repeated measures analysis. RESULTS: The overall response rates were 73 &#x 0025;, while complete response was seen in 12. 4 &#x 0025;. Reduction in analgesic consumption with improvement in Karnofsky performance score and mobility score, was seen in all responders. Response rates were 80. 3 and 80. 5 &#x 0025; in breast and prostate cancer, respectively. One case, each of Wilms tumor, ovarian cancer, germ cell tumor testis, multiple myeloma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor and oesophageal cancer, did not respond to therapy. No serious side-effects were noted, except for fall in white blood cell, platelet and haemoglobin counts, which gradually returned to normal levels by six-eight weeks. CONCLUSION: Sm- 153 EDTMP provided effective palliation in 73 &#x 0025; patients with painful bone metastases: the major toxicity was temporary myelosuppression...|$|E

30|$|In {{the early}} times of radiopharmacy, it was {{discovered}} already that the addition of chelating agents alters the biological distribution of lanthanides from primary liver uptake to almost exclusively bone accumulation [5]. “Bone seeking” polycarboxy-polyphosphates like <b>ethylenediamine</b> <b>tetra(methylene</b> phosphonic acid) (EDTMP) showed promising first results [8, 9]. Due to their low kinetic stability with lanthanide ions [10], a high EDTMP concentration in the blood pool is necessary for a stable complexation in vivo, which consequently creates a high amount of ligand carrier [11]. As opposed to these open-chain chelators, macrocyclic chelators like 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane N,N′,N″,N″-tetra-acetic acid (DOTA) show a very strong thermodynamic and kinetic stability with lanthanides [12, 13]. Even equimolar metal to DOTA ratios guarantee for complexation and in vivo stability. Initial experiments with phosphonic acid derivatives (DOTP) of DOTA complexed with 177 Lu showed sufficient bone accumulation and low uptake in soft tissue [14].|$|R

The effects of coexisting Ca(II), Pb(II), citrate, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the Ni(II) adsorption by this chelating membrane were revealed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Pb(II) showed a more detrimental effect than Ca(II) on the Ni(II) uptake; EDTA interfered with the capture of Ni(II) more remarkably than citrate and NTA. The results derived from DFT calculations {{were consistent with the}} experimental data. Ni(II) and Pb(II) showed more excellent affinity to the EDTMPA-TBOT/PVDF membrane than Ca(II). The stabilities between Ni(II) and the [EDTMPA-TBOT] 7 − chelating ligand of the membrane and those between Ni(II) and the three aforementioned complexing reagents followed the sequence: [Ni(II) -(EDTMPA-TBOT) ] 5 − > Ni(II) -EDTA > Ni(II) -NTA > Ni(II) -citrate. The complexation between Ni(II) and the chelating membrane was prominent with the presence of citrate, NTA and EDTA...|$|R
5000|$|Phosphonates are {{effective}} chelating agents. That is, they bind tightly to di- and trivalent metal ions, which {{is useful in}} water softening. In this way, they prevent formation of insoluble precipitates (scale). The binding of these ligands also suppresses the catalytic properties of metal ions. They are stable under harsh conditions. For these reasons, an important industrial use of phosphonates is in cooling waters, desalination systems, and in oil fields to inhibit scale formation. Phosphonates are also regularly used in reverse osmosis systems as anti-scalants. Phosphonates in cooling water systems also serve to control corrosion of iron and steel. In pulp and paper manufacturing and in textile industry they serve as [...] "peroxide bleach stabilizers", by chelating metals that could inactivate the peroxide. In detergents they are used as a combination of chelating agent, scale inhibitor, and bleach stabilizer. Phosphonates are also increasingly used in medicine to treat disorders associated with bone formation and calcium metabolism. Furthermore, they serve as carriers for radionuclides in bone cancer treatments (see samarium-153-ethylene diamine <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>phosphonate).</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction One of the {{important}} applications of nuclear physics in medicine {{is the use of}} radioactive elements as radiopharmaceuticals. Metastatic bone disease is {{the most common form of}} malignant bone tumors. Samarium- 153 -ethylene diamine <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>phosphonate</b> (153 Sm-EDTMP) as a radiopharmaceutical is used for pain palliation. This radiopharmaceutical usually emits beta particles, which have a high uptake in bone tissues. The purpose of this study was to calculate the radiation dose distribution of 153 Sm-EDTMP in bone and other tissues, using MCNPX Monte Carlo code in the particle transport model. Materials and Methods Dose delivery to the bone was simulated by seeking radiopharmaceuticals on the bone surface. The phantom model had a simple cylindrical geometry and included bone, bone marrow, and soft tissue. Results The simulation results showed that a significant amount of radiation dose was delivered to the bone by the use of this radiopharmaceutical. Conclusion Thebone acted as a fine protective shield against rays for the bone marrow. Therefore, the trivial absorbed dose by the bone marrow caused less damage to bone-making cells. Also, the high absorbed dose of the bone could destroy cancer cells and relieve the pain in the bone...|$|R
40|$|Sol-gel {{films were}} {{prepared}} using different ratios of two silica precursors, vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), targeting the anticorrosion treatment of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3. The electrochemical {{behavior of the}} alloy coated with such films, which was studied in a 0. 05 mol L- 1 NaCI solution, revealed that the VTMS/TEOS ratio drastically affects the anticorrosion performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results provided evidences that the best anticorrosive response occurs with the films prepared from 50 % (v/v) ethanol, 46 % (v/v) water, 3 % (v/v) VTMS and 1 % (v/v) TEOS. Moreover, {{the effects of the}} addition of <b>ethylenediamine</b> <b>tetra(methylene</b> phosphonic acid) (EDTPO) to a hybrid sol-gel matrix were examined. The corrosion resistance was considerably improved when the concentration of added phosphonic acid was 3. 75 x 10 (- 5) mol L- 1. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that EDTPO-containing films provide a more uniform coverage. Results evidenced the formation of S-O-Al linkages in the VTMS/TEOS and VTMS/TEOS/EDTPO systems and that the VTMS/TEOS/EDTPO system contained P-O-Al linkages. The P-O-Al bonds, combined with the modified silica network action, may be responsible for the good anticorrosive behavior of the VTMS/TEOS/EDTPO films. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Chemical {{extraction}} of phosphorus (P) from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) is adversely influenced by co-dissolution of metals and metalloids. This study investigated P recovery and leaching of Zn, Cu, Pb, As and Ni from ISSA using inorganic acids (sulphuric acid and nitric acid), organic acids (oxalic acid and citric acid), and chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylene diamine <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>phosphonate</b> (EDTMP)). The {{aim of this}} study was to optimize a leaching process to recover P-leachate with high purity for P fertilizer production. The results show that both organic and inorganic acids extract P-containing phases but organic acids leach more trace elements, particularly Cu, Zn, Pb and As. Sulphuric acid was the most efficient for P recovery and achieved 94 % of total extraction under the optimal conditions, which were 2 -h reaction with 0. 2  mol/L H 2 SO 4 at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 20 : 1. EDTA extracted only 20 % of the available P, but the leachates were contaminated with high levels of trace elements under optimum conditions (3 -h reaction with EDTA at 0. 02  mol/L, pH 2, and liquid-to-solid ratio of 20 : 1). Therefore, EDTA was considered an appropriate pre-treatment agent for reducing the total metal/metalloid content in ISSA, which produced negligible changes in the structure of ISSA and reduced contamination during subsequent P extraction using sulphuric acid...|$|R

Methods: MDP was dissolved in water and HEDP and EDTMP were dissolved in NaOH 1 N followed by reduction of pH with HCl 1 N. To all mixtures stannous chloride and (ReO 4 -) -Re- 188 were added in a nitrogen atmosphere. the preparations were heated in boiling water bath for 15 min. Yield as well as radiochemical stability was estimated by ITLC. Different concentrations of phosphonates and stannous chloride were evaluated. Biodistribution studies in Swiss mice were done for the three Re- 188 -phosphonates that presented the best radiochemical yield. the optimal ligand concentration for maximum complexation was 85. 2 mM for MDP, 72. 8 mM for HEDP and 45. 8 mM for EDTMP. the best amount of SnCl 2 - 2 H(2) O was 1. 5 mg/mL for Re- 188 -HEDP and 1 mg/mL for both Re- 188 -MDP and Re- 188 -EDTMP. in these conditons the three complexes showed a complexation rate above 95 %. Reasonable radiochemical stability for 24 hours was achieved by Re- 188 -EDTMP when employing ascorbic acid. All products showed a great uptake by the kidneys. Re- 188 -EDTMP had the greatest uptake by femur (3. 1 +/- 0. 2 % ID/g) followed by Re- 188 -MDP (1. 2 +/- 0. 1 % ID/g) and Re- 188 -HEDP (1. 0 +/- 0. 1 % ID/g), 4 hours post injection. Re- 188 -EDTMP displayed a femur bone/muscle ratio of 28. 5, Re- 188 -MDP 4. 9 and Re- 188 -HEDP 4. 9. in conclusion Re- 188 -EDTMP demonstrated the best potential as a radiopharmaceutical for bone cancer pain relief, encouraging further dosimetric studies and clinical trials.

40|$|Introduction: Samarium- 153 {{ethylene}} diamine <b>tetramethylene</b> <b>phosphonate</b> (153 Sm-EDTMP) is an available and approved radiopharmaceutical for palliative therapy {{of patients with}} painful multiple bone metastases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the palliative effect and myelotoxicity of 153 Sm-EDTMP treatment in patients with painful bone metastases. Methods: Sixteen cases (9 male, 7 female, mean age: 57. 25 &plusmn; 16. 74 yrs) with severe refractory painful bone metastases from the malignancies of prostate (n= 7), breast (n= 7) and endocrine glands (n= 2) were entered in a before-after study. A standard questionnaire for numeric rating of pain severity, quality of life (QL) and the dose of analgesic drugs was applied for all patients and the scores (ranged between 0 and 10) before treatment as well as the scores at the end of the 2 nd, 4 th and 8 th weeks after treatment were recorded. Cell blood count was measured at the baseline and weekly up to 4 weeks after treatment. A standard common toxicity criteria (CTC) was defined for scoring the degree of myelotoxicity. Repeated measures analysis of variances was applied to analyze within subject effects of treatment on the scores over different time points of the study. Results: A significant pain relief was found in 68. 7 % of patients by the 2 nd week after treatment. The rate of significant pain relief at the end of the 8 th week was 75 %. Average total pain scores in repeated measures were significantly reduced from 5. 68 &plusmn; 1. 97 to 4. 42 &plusmn; 2. 44 (p= 0. 048) and 4. 12 &plusmn; 1. 61 (p= 0. 032) by the 2 nd and 4 th weeks after treatment, respectively. The QL scores was also improved over three time points of the study (p= 0. 002). Although average cell blood counts in every four weeks after treatment were diminished as compared to the baseline counts, all patients were in grade 1 or 2 of myelotoxicity based on CTC scores. Conclusion: The present study reveals a significant analgesic effect for 153 Sm-EDTMP in patients suffering from metastasis-related bone pain refractory to the other analgesic drugs or narcotics. This treatment may also improve the quality of life and reduce the dose of analgesic and narcotic drugs during the period of 8 weeks after treatment while resulting in only mild and trivial adverse effects...|$|R
