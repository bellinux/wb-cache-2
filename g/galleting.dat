The building had [...] "substantial {{time and money}} spent on it" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the principal archaeologist. The flints were selected to decrease in size as the walls rose, and the internal corners were decorated with limestone blocks set as quoins.

[...] There were entrances in the west and northeast walls, and some evidence that there were once windows in the northwest and south walls. The floor was compacted soil, and the original roof material is unknown, but the presence of a few glazed floor tiles and Flemish pantiles of a somewhat later date is consistent with a higher-status appearance. There was no internal wall at this date, but there may have been an external wooden extension to the southwest corner.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gallet</b> gal-ey / ˈgæl.eɪ is the world’s oldest {{watch and}} clock making house with history {{dating back to}} Humbertus <b>Gallet,</b> a clock maker who became a citizen of Geneva in 1466. The <b>Gallet</b> & Cie (<b>Gallet</b> & Company) name was officially {{registered}} by Julien <b>Gallet</b> (1806-1849) in 1826, who moved the family business from Geneva to La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Prior to this date, operations commenced {{under the name of}} each of the <b>Gallet</b> family patriarchs.|$|R

50|$|St John's is {{constructed}} in slate and igneous rock, with some <b>galleting.</b> It is roofed with green slate. The plan is simple, {{consisting of a}} six-bay nave and chancel in one range, a small west tower, and a north porch. The windows {{along the sides of}} the church have two lights, and the east window has three lights. The tower has twin bell openings, and a battlemented parapet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galleting,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} garretting or garnetting, is an architectural technique in which {{small pieces of}} stone are pushed into wet mortar during {{the construction of a}} building. It is mostly used for stone building when freestone is not available, since it helps to fill the uneven gaps and reinforces the mortar. Although primarily for this purpose, it is sometimes also used for decorative effect. Norwich Guildhall is an early 15th-century example, but the technique was used in vernacular architecture until the 19th century. In higher status buildings it was superseded by square knapping the flints to produce flat, squared stones that produced a surface with little exposed mortar.|$|E
50|$|Carrstone {{can vary}} in quality {{depending}} on {{factors such as}} the degree of iron oxide present, and sufficient pressure to form the matrix. Because of its variations it does not lend itself to carving or finer work. Carrstonework can be seen in buildings as: random carrstone, coursed carrstone, ashlared carrstone, all with, or without, <b>galleting.</b> Other patterns of use are: rough carrstone sipps (slips or brickettes) and cut carrstone sipps, both used in masonry fields between brickwork quoins. Cut carrstone sipps are used extensively at Sandringham House on the main building and the stables block. Other examples of carrstone work can be found on St Mary's Church, Barton Bendish as well as many other parish churches in the region. Hunstanton and Wolferton feature some interesting examples along with the 'Gingerbread Town' of Downham Market, notably the Grade II Listed Downham Market railway station.|$|E

40|$|<b>Galleting</b> is the {{practice}} of inserting chips of stone into the mortar joints of masonry. Its long and enduring history is not explained by the belief that it is primarily decorative and a convincing purpose is sought. Information is not only in short supply but also inconsistent in the unsubstantiated views expressed. A detailed understanding of galleted masonry is necessary for its correct conservation. To better understand the subject {{a wide range of}} galleted mortar joints were photographed, questionnaires were sent to professionals and their views correlated and a separate convenience survey conducted. The geographical spread of <b>galleting</b> was plotted and the origins of <b>galleting</b> sought through secondary data sources. Finally, a series of new and innovative tests was devised to establish the influence of gallets on the strength and durability of lime mortar joints. A definition and taxonomy was devised to aid positive identification of <b>galleting.</b> Lime mortar joints are susceptible to early failure due to the slow progression of carbonation, exposure to weathering and the build-up of stresses. It was found that the incorporation of gallets into joints resolved this by significantly increasing compressive strength and reducing shrinkage. The gallets, being stronger than the mortar, accommodate the shear stresses and minimise the risk of failure. At the same time, they increase the durability of a wall and reduce damage due to weathering. Results show that <b>galleting</b> has been in use for many centuries, is more widespread than is generally recognised and almost certainly started out as a significant structural element in masonry construction. The true purpose of <b>galleting</b> and its relationship to the mortar in which it is bedded throws new light onto the use of non-hydraulic lime mortar in construction and conservation work. This will help conservationists and operatives to understand the complex nature of this traditional form of building...|$|E
