5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social {{role of women}} largely depended on their economic status and level of <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being concerned about foreign matters, Löhe retained a concern for domestic social matters. Here he saw the bad situation of many unmarried girls and young women. In the rural society {{they had a very}} underprivileged status and suffered from lack of <b>education.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> spirit, he founded the first Deaconess Mother House in 1849. The house became a place of social and education activity, hosting schools, hospitals, and other social agencies. The deaconesses lived in celibacy and in a spiritual-economic community.|$|E

25|$|As {{for higher}} education, the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens was closed in 526. There {{was also a}} school in Alexandria which {{remained}} open until the Arab conquest (640). The University of Constantinople, founded by Emperor Theodosius II (425), seems to have dissolved around this time. It was refounded by Emperor Michael III in 849. Higher <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period focused on rhetoric, although Aristotle's logic was covered in simple outline. Under the Macedonian dynasty (867–1056), Byzantium enjoyed a golden age and a revival of classical learning. There was little original research, but many lexicons, anthologies, encyclopedias, and commentaries.|$|E

As the demands for more pharmacists increased, the demands of professional <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> particular field increased as well. As a result, in 1992, the faculty introduced the PharmD-Doctor of Pharmacy- in hopes to accommodate for the growing need for graduates in the field. Within the past decade, enrolment in the undergraduate and graduate programs and doubled and tripled in size respectively. The Faculty {{had no choice but}} to expand their facilities, thus moving to their current location at 144 College Street in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Commercial sex work {{is illegal}} in China; hence, brothels are illegal and {{commercial}} sex workers operate out of places of entertainment (e.g., karaoke bars), hotels, hair-dressing salons, {{or on the}} street. The traditional strategy for controlling HIV transmission through commercial sex workers has been the development of stricter laws to prevent risky behaviors, accompanied by raids on suspected sex establishments by public security officials. Those apprehended are subject to compulsory education on law and morality, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and forced participation in productive labor. Under the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law, those knowingly infected with HIV who continue to practice prostitution are subject to more severe penalties and criminal liability for creating a risk of spreading a quarantinable disease. Detention ranges from 6 months to 2 years. Until recently, health <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> system was uncommon.|$|E

25|$|In Isleta, Lummis {{divorced}} {{his first}} wife and married Eva Douglas, {{who lived in the}} village and was the sister-in-law of an English trader. Somehow he convinced Eva to stay with Dorothea in Los Angeles until the divorce went through. In the meantime, Lummis became entangled in fights with the U.S. government agents over Indian <b>education.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> period, the government was pushing assimilation and had established Indian boarding schools. It charged its agents with recruiting Native American children for the schools, where they were usually forced to give up traditional clothing and hair styles, and prevented from speaking their own languages or using their own customs. They were often prohibited from returning home during holidays or vacation periods, or their families were too poor to afford such travel. Lummis persuaded the government to allow 36 children from the Albuquerque Indian School to return to their homes.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region, North West Territories, began officially in 1885 with Territorial Ordinance #5. North West Territorial Schools Districts or One Room School Houses {{replaced}} trading post schooling, missionary schools and private schooling of the past. Moose Jaw School District #1 was formally established December 5, 1884 {{under the new}} Board of Education. The 1944 School Act set out to establish larger consolidated schools {{and the formation of}} the schools and school districts presently in use. As with any Canadian province, the Saskatchewan Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated before 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). For historians and genealogists, previous school district records have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives Regina Branch.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fitting}} {{tribute to the}} legacy of Clerk, other West Indian missionaries and the Basel Mission, the British Governor of the Gold Coast during World War I, Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, reacted to the {{expulsion}} of Basel Mission as alien security risk from the Gold Coast by lamenting that, the forced departure was “the greatest blow which <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country has ever suffered;” describing their work as the “first and foremost as regards quality of education and character training” – {{a testament to the}} mission’s approach of combining academic study with practical training for life. While propagation of the Gospel was the main objective of the West Indians and the Basel Mission, the domestic socioeconomic and dire educational environment motivated them to establish the first formal schools and colleges in the country, open to pupils from all walks of life. Moreover, the missionaries provided alternative sources of employment to rural inhabitants through the establishment of mechanized agriculture and commerce-driven small-scale industries such as construction and craftsmanship including printing, tile manufacturing and weaving in order to create self-sufficiency among the natives.|$|E

[...] When Attalus died in 197BC at the age of 72, he was succeeded by his eldest son Eumenes II. Polybius, describing Attalus' life says [...] "and what is more remarkable than all, though he left four grown-up sons, he so well settled the question of succession, that the crown was handed down to his children's children without a single dispute." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cultural factors {{affecting}} youth exclusion include reactions to socially constructed categories like race and gender. These classifications can also influence an individual's {{choice to be}} excluded from society. Some academics argue that youth are marginalized because they choose to separate themselves from mainstream society, opting instead to participate in alternative lifestyles and subcultures. Others, however, view this choice as a [...] "forced choice", motivated by the fear of racial, gender {{and other types of}} discrimination. McDonald presents the example of a young black man in the UK who chooses not to go to university because [...] "he fears discrimination as a university student". McDonald says, [...] "This is a negative externality imposed by the socially included that is influencing the choice of the young black man in the direction of social exclusion". [...] In this example both structural and cultural barriers influenced this student so he felt excluded from society; he felt pressure from society to remain on the periphery, and in doing so denying himself access to an <b>education.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> situation education failed as an established social structure to provide this individual with inclusion into society.|$|E
