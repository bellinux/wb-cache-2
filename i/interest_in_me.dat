2500|$|Gurdjieff's former {{students}} who have criticized him argue that, despite his seeming total lack of pretension {{to any kind of}} [...] "guru holiness," [...] in many anecdotes his behavior displays the unsavory and impure character {{of a man who was}} a cynical manipulator of his followers. Gurdjieff's own pupils wrestled to understand him. [...] For example, in a written exchange between Luc Dietrich and Henri Tracol dating to 1943: [...] "L.D.: [...] How do you know that Gurdjieff wishes you well? [...] H.T.: [...] I feel sometimes how little I interest him—and how strongly he takes an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> [...] By that I measure the strength of an intentional feeling." ...|$|E
2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. I did some roping and riding, and Jack, {{who was one of}} the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him I learned the great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off. It's the fellow who knows when to quit that the audience wants more of.|$|E
60|$|There's a good deal. I {{really had}} no idea the world was so <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In early-2010, two episodes {{were chosen}} to be shown on NZ On Screen and Tammy Davis of Outrageous Fortune starred in an {{internet}} promotional video which spoofed the series. On 9 April, Scoop.co.nz reported that On the Mat ranked #3 among the top 10 most watched videos on NZ on Screen. The episodes were favourably reviewed by 411mania.com shortly after their release and whose author, Ryan Byers, wrote they [...] "were very fun to watch as a curiosity, a look into an old territory that I, as an American, have almost never seen or even heard discussed" [...] and that [...] "these shows created an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> in seeing more from the New Zealand territory, {{if for no other}} reason than to document some of the forgotten career moments of US wrestlers who heavily toured abroad".|$|E
2500|$|O'Day {{conveyed}} her {{hope that}} fans continue {{to honor the}} group that [...] "made her a star". [...] "Danity Kane was a wonderful group, and like all things, nothing is forever," [...] she said. [...] "We had a great run {{and we were very}} successful. We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I feel, they can go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned you have to fight to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E

60|$|RIDGEON [with a self-assured {{shake of}} the head] I've {{a pretty good}} flair {{for that sort of}} thing. I know when a woman is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> She is.|$|R
6000|$|... "How comes it," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you are so}} much <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me?</b> I {{remember}} seeing you two years ago, but have no recollection of having done you any service." ...|$|R
60|$|It's {{very kind}} of you to take an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> My {{headache}} has passed off.|$|E

6000|$|After {{a proper}} {{interval}} I volunteered some valuable {{data concerning the}} mosquitoes and flies I had encountered on my recent trip into the wilderness of British Columbia. He became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Oh! You've been to the Klondike!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He.--You {{have always}} taken some <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> because I am a [...] bon diable, whom you rather despise at bottom, but who diverts [...] you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, yes, I {{suppose you}} would. You {{must have taken}} a deeper <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> than in the others, since you married me. I hadn't thought of that.' ...|$|E

5000|$|About {{his work}} Collins has said, [...] "A camera brings {{interested}} parties together. It attracts and repels according to circumstance or whim. A camera makes <b>me</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{you and you}} maybe <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> this sense, it's all about love. And exploitation.

6000|$|... "Well, that is strange," [...] she declared. [...] "You are {{upsetting}} {{one of my}} pet theories. All the men whom I {{have ever}} known have been more curious than women. Are you <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> by any chance, Sir Julien?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It is strange,' she said, frowning, 'that {{you should}} still press an {{undesired}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> and my acquaintances, {{in me and}} my affairs, Mr Clennam. I don't know what you mean.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} he thinks of me, really? He must have felt <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> else he would not have sent me my necklace. I {{wonder what he}} thinks of my marriage? What notions has he to make him so grave about things? Why is he come to Diplow?" ...|$|R
