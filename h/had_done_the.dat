Eventually, Ric decided the pressure of covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E

5|$|After the election, {{rather than}} take a job with Roosevelt's {{administration}} in Albany, Howe remained in New York City to prepare for Roosevelt's 1932 presidential run. During this period, he worked closely with James Farley, chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and another devoted Roosevelt supporter. Roosevelt would later publicly credit the pair with being {{the two men who}} <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> most to secure his election.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, racing {{under his}} {{name for the}} first time, started the 1818 season much earlier than he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} two seasons, with his first race coming on 18 May at the York Spring Meeting in a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each over two miles. He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's Rasping, who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from Rasping, with Hornby in third and Whiff last of the four runners.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked {{if he would have}} taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E

5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view to}} expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Poole {{announced}} the deletion of the /r9k/ ("ROBOT9000") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose {{of being a}} test implementation of xkcd's ROBOT9000 script. During the same year, the /soc/ board was created {{in an effort to}} reduce the number of socialization threads on /b/. /r9k/ was restored on October 23, 2011, along with /hc/ ("Hardcore", previously deleted), /pol/ (a rebranding of /new/) and the new /diy/ board, in addition to an apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of Encyclopedia Dramatica, and realized that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Baker {{graduated}} from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, {{and finished with}} above-average grades. He was named the school's best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete {{and the man who}} <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker's three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally well with a record of twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost to Yale.|$|E

Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese were {{experiencing}} similar problems {{in relation to}} supplies, they began their advance once again on 26 August and despite several rugged defensive actions the Australians were forced back again, first to Eora Creek on 30 August, then Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, and finally to Efogi three days later. Exhausted from their efforts and {{no longer able to}} be considered an effective fighting force, the 39th was relieved and sent down the track to Koitaki to rest. They <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> job that was required of them, having stalled the Japanese advance in order to allow reinforcements to be brought up. These reinforcements came {{in the shape of the}} 25th Brigade, comprising the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions. Bitter fighting ensued around Ioribaiwa and the Australians withdrew once again on 17 September, this time to Imita Ridge; however, the Japanese had reached their limit and on 24 September began to withdraw. The Australians subsequently launched a counter-offensive in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands.|$|E
5|$|Gil Merrick was {{the first}} Birmingham manager {{to win a major}} trophy, the League Cup in 1963. Merrick also led the club to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1961, {{following}} Pat Beasley who <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same in 1960. Leslie Knighton took the club to the final of the FA Cup in 1931; Arthur Turner did likewise in 1956, as well as taking charge of the club's highest league finish, sixth place in the 1955–56 First Division. Birmingham reached the 2001 Football League Cup Final under Trevor Francis, whose successor as permanent manager, Steve Bruce, twice achieved promotion to the Premier League. Birmingham won the League Cup for the second time under Alex McLeish in 2011. The 1966 World Cup-winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, took charge of the club briefly in 1977.|$|E

5|$|In 1629, Edward Hyde {{married his}} first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Grittenham. Six {{months into the}} {{marriage}} Anne caught smallpox, miscarried and died. Three years later, Hyde married Frances Aylesbury. In 1637, Anne, the couple's eldest daughter, was born at Cranbourne Lodge in Windsor. Almost nothing except that she was named after Edward Hyde's first wife is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the Netherlands after {{the execution of the}} deposed King Charles I. They settled in Breda, where they were offered a home by Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, who <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same with many English fugitives. The Princess appointed Anne a maid of honour, apparently against the wishes of her mother and late father.|$|E
5|$|In 1996–97, Colorado won the Pacific Division, {{as well as}} the Presidents' Trophy for {{finishing}} the regular season with {{the best record in the}} league: 49–24–9 for 107 points. The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the league's first All-Star team at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Martina's {{participation}} in the 200m finals round was controversial. Martina came in second place to Usain Bolt, completing the event in 19.82 seconds over Usain Bolt's world-record breaking performance of 19.30 seconds. However, when American would-be bronze medalist Wallace Spearmon was disqualified for running outside of his lane, the American coaches reviewed video records of the race and found that Martina <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> same. The United States filed a protest against the Netherlands Antilles. The Dutch Antillean Olympic committee argued that the challenge was invalid, having been filed after the 30-minute post-race deadline, but Martina was disqualified from receiving the silver medal anyway. Shawn Crawford of the United States, who originally finished the race in fourth place, was given the silver medal, and Walter Dix was given the bronze medal in place of Spearmon.|$|E

5|$|On 12 October, for {{the third}} time, Farnese {{supplied}} the garrison of Zutphen, personally, as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> first time. Later on, he sent Verdugo back to Friesland and left Johann Baptista von Taxis in charge of Zutphen. After that, the Spanish army took its winter quarters. When Farnese moved to Brussels to spend the winter there, the Earl of Leicester continued the siege of Zutphen. He {{was not able to}} take the town, but succeeded in occupying several forts beyond the IJssel, including Zutphen's sconce, which was carried by surprise by Edward Stanley, brother of William Stanley, and 12 other soldiers. Shortly after the English and Dutch also took their winter quarters. Sir William Stanley was given the command of Deventer, Sir John Burroughs of Doesburg, and Rowland York of Zutphen's sconce. Stanley and York's appointments were met with suspicion by the Dutch States, because Stanley was openly Catholic and York a man of dissolute character. Leicester expressed his full confidence in both soldiers, but in 1587 Stanley and York shifted sides to the Spanish party and handed Deventer and Zutphen's sconce over to Taxis.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> <b>The</b> occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> <b>The</b> music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, and then once the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
