25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented near-field enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general <b>design</b> <b>rule,</b> tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider tyres and rims. [...] The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed [...] "deck-chair" [...] seats.

Although existing tools and techniques provide support for correcting inconsistencies, they target generally-applicable <b>design</b> <b>rules.</b> Unfortunately, {{in addition to these}} common <b>design</b> <b>rules,</b> any software system has an abundance of custom <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> that are very specific to the system at hand.

40|$|Current <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> for {{determining}} the member strength of cold-formed steel columns {{are based on the}} effective length of the member and a single column capacity curve for both pin-ended and fixed-ended columns. This research has reviewed the use of AS/NZS 4600 <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> for their accuracy in determining the member compression capacities of slender cold-formed steel columns using detailed numerical studies. It has shown that AS/NZS 4600 <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> accurately predicted the capacities of pinned and fixed ended columns undergoing flexural buckling. However, for fixed ended columns undergoing flexural-torsional buckling, it was found that current AS/NZS 4600 <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> did not include the beneficial effect of warping fixity.

40|$|Current <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> for {{the member}} {{capacities}} of cold-formed steel columns {{are based on}} the same non-dimensional strength curve for both fixed and pinned-ended columns at ambient temperature. This research has investigated the accuracy of using current ambient temperature <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> in Australia/New Zealand (AS/NZS 4600), American (AISI S 100) and European (Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3) standards in determining the flexural-torsional buckling capacities of cold-formed steel columns at uniform elevated temperatures using appropriately reduced mechanical properties. It was found that these <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> accurately predicted the member capacities of pin ended lipped channel columns undergoing flexural torsional buckling at elevated temperatures. However, for fixed ended columns with warping fixity undergoing flexural-torsional buckling, the current <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> significantly underestimated the column capacities as they disregard the beneficial effect of warping fixity. This paper has therefore recommended the use of improved <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> developed for ambient temperature conditions to predict the axial compression capacities of fixed ended columns subject to flexural-torsional buckling at elevated temperatures within AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design provisions. The accuracy of the proposed fire <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> was verified using finite element analysis and test results of cold-formed lipped channel columns at elevated temperatures except for low strength steel columns with intermediate slenderness whose behaviour was influenced by the increased nonlinearity in the stress-strain curves at elevated temperatures.

40|$|Cold-formed steel beams are {{increasingly}} used as floor joists and bearers in buildings and often their behaviour and moment capacities {{are influenced by}} lateral-torsional buckling. With increasing usage of cold-formed steel beams their fire safety design has become an important issue. Fire <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> are commonly based on past research on hot-rolled steel beams. Hence a detailed parametric study was undertaken using validated finite element models to investigate the lateral-torsional buckling behaviour of simply supported cold-formed steel lipped channel beams subjected to uniform bending at uniform elevated temperatures. The moment capacity results were compared with the predictions from the available ambient temperature and fire <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> and suitable recommendations were made.
