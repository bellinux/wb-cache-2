5|$|Silkies are {{considered}} a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only <b>four</b> <b>pounds</b> (1.8kg), and females weighing three pounds (1.36kg). The American Standard of Perfection calls for males that are 36 ounces (1kg), and females that are 32 ounces (910grams).|$|E

The McDiarmid family built four fishing camps along the east bank between Grouse Creek and the Mahood River.

500|$|Another {{traditional}} assumption, {{based on}} {{the language of the}} inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a buffet beside it. The buffet of the period was more like a modern Welsh dresser or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use. [...] Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used to drink from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over <b>four</b> <b>pounds</b> in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently. [...] However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the Saint Chapelle at his capital of Bourges, intended to rival the king's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and his brother's foundation at Champmol in Dijon.|$|E

500|$|The synod at Croft held by Wiglaf in 836, which Beorhtwulf {{may have}} attended, {{was the last}} such {{conclave}} called together by a Mercian king. [...] During Beorhtwulf's reign and thereafter, the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury. [...] A charter of 840 provides evidence {{of a different kind}} concerning Beorhtwulf's relations with the church. [...] The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire. [...] The lands had come {{under the control of the}} church in Worcester, but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again. [...] In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church's right to the land, but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return: [...] "four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds, and two silver horns of <b>four</b> <b>pounds</b> ..... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds." [...] This is not an isolated case; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church, such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester, and promised in return that he would be [...] "more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community" [...] and, in the words of historian Patrick Wormald, [...] "would not rob them in future". [...] Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find, as so much land had been granted to monasteries. [...] The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede, who in a letter to Egbert, the Archbishop of York, had complained of [...] "a complete lack of places where the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate". [...] Beorhtwulf's concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement, and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure.|$|E
