2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. But every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E
2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought I was dead. Hey, I thought I was dead, too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. I {{enter his}} private office. I reveal no secret when I {{say that he}} is not cordial.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Madame Bouvet's, to find Nick {{emerging}} from his toilet.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the balcony. On the way I {{got hold}} of Charlie.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my bedroom, {{and opened}} my Diary, {{and read the}} story again.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what made}} you call {{yourself}} an errand boy?" [...] she exclaimed reproachfully. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house I intend to tell Joshua Holt and--and Mr. Spence {{that you are a}} great lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{much longer}} before you can do so again, if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Islands with papa. I shall expect you to be true, you know; {{and it will be}} ten years at the least before I can hope to be home again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} for a walk with Miss Beatrice; she is coming home by the village," [...] he answered. [...] "I don't mind rain, and I wanted {{to get as much}} fresh air as I could before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mill. Thank you--only a cup of tea--I will get {{something}} to eat as I go." ...|$|E
60|$|Be {{it enough}} to say, that when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Browndown, Lucilla <b>went</b> with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw God. God was light, God was truth. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my life, and God was hidden. God {{seemed to}} call me. He called. I heard him, I sought him and I touched his hand. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my life <b>I</b> was {{presently}} lost in perplexity. I {{could not tell}} why God had called me nor what I had to do." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Public Library {{and into}} the {{newspaper}} room to think over this problem.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{watching}} to see if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cabin," [...] thought Walter. [...] "If he doesn't see me {{by the time the}} others return he'll smell a rat. There's nothing more to be gained by staying here. I've proved that we are being watched, and that's all I can do. It's up to me to get back and tell the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have all}} been very kind to me," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, {{so much so that}} I feel, if I stay any longer among you, I shall never be content to rough it when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bush. This is only too pleasant, but, being a poor man with a living to earn, it would be more {{consistent}} if I recommenced my work. Which of the operations should I undertake first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So, having {{wrapped up}} and carried forth the corpse, and {{chanting}} hymns of the Christian tradition, Antony grew sad, {{because he had}} no spade, wherewith to dig the ground; and thinking over many plans in his mind, said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monastery, it is a three days' journey. If I stay here, I shall be of no more use. I will die, then, as it is fit; and, falling beside thy warrior, Christ, breathe my last breath." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus was {{assurance}} made doubly sure, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{my house}} hugging myself with rapture.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the office, the man {{following}} with groans of pain, and I {{turned up}} the lamp.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} sitting-room door behind us. Followed by Mr. Bruff and Betteredge, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Blake's room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] {{replied the}} Wizard Fox. [...] "And {{we can take}} Gugu the King with us, and have Glinda restore him to his natural shape. But I hate to leave my Bag of Magic Tools behind me, for without it I shall lose much of my power as a Wizard. Also, if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emerald City {{in the shape of}} a Fox, the Oz people will think I'm a poor Wizard and will lose their respect for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Later {{in the day}} Wetherford {{expressed}} deeper dejection. [...] "I don't {{see anything}} ahead of me anyhow," [...] he confessed. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'pen' I'll die of lung trouble, and I don't know how I'm going {{to earn a living}} in the city. Mebbe the best thing I could do would be to take the pox and go under. I'm afraid of big towns," [...] he continued. [...] "I always was--even when I had money. Now that I am old and broke I daren't go. No city for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why do you {{contemplate}} {{life as a}} whole, Mr. Merton? Why are you so moral? If {{you think}} it is amusing you are very much mistaken! Isn't the scenery, isn't the weather, beautiful enough for you? I could gaze for ever at the [...] "unquiet bright Atlantic plain," [...] the rocky isles, those cliffs of basalt on either hand, while I listened to the crystal stream that slips into the sea, and waves the yellow fringes of the seaweed. Don't be melancholy, or <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle. Try another line!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} it might be best to let the Gandhi motif slide. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where we had started.|$|R
60|$|As it was, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London {{the very}} next day, {{determined}} to renew my slight acquaintance with Reggie Nettlecraft.|$|R
60|$|A week hence I {{start for}} the Island of Kauai, to be gone three weeks and then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> California.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Affair of Babel: This Confusion of Language or of Councils, take it {{which way}} you will, {{as the first}} Disappointment that I find the Devil met with, in all his Attempts and Practices upon Mankind, or upon the new Creature, which I {{mentioned}} above; for now he foresaw what would follow; namely, that the People would separate and spread themselves over the whole Surface of the Earth, and a thousand new Scenes of Actions would appear, in which he therefore prepares himself to behave as he should see Occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "There you are," [...] he said, {{when he had}} {{replaced}} the mouthpiece on its hook, [...] "if I hadn't been here they would probably have had {{the roof of the}} tunnel down and killed some people. No, no; I can't leave that receiver unless <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mine, which I am too tired to do. However, don't you fret. With a pistol, a telephone, and Pharaoh I'm safe enough. And now, good night; you fellows had better be getting home as I must be up early to-morrow and want to sleep while I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I must be content," [...] said she, rising, with a {{composed}} face. [...] "I have prayed {{you to take}} ruth, {{and indeed}} I can do no more; but ere <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest I would rede you {{to be on your}} guard lest you lose your bag once more. Wot you how I took it, archer? Nay, it was simple enough, and may happen again, so I make it clear to you. I had this knife in my sleeve, and though it is small it is very sharp. I slipped it down like this. Then when I seemed to weep with my face against the saddle, I cut down like this--" ...|$|E
60|$|And I couldn't get {{any more}} out of her. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Florence and reported. She got pretty excited about it.|$|R
60|$|By the way, when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife met {{me at the}} door.|$|R
3000|$|... (Just {{got some}} {{medicine}} for allergic rhinitis from the hospital, {{have to take}} some every time when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> China.) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two years, mademoiselle. Time to go {{home and}} paint, is it not? But art--!" [...] he shrugged his heavy round shoulders, his whole bear-like body. [...] "A little mad," [...] he muttered once more. [...] "I will tell you a story. Once in winter after I had rested a fortnight, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{trenches}} at night, and I want some earth to fill up {{a hole in the ground}} where I was sleeping; when one has slept in a bed one becomes particular. Well, I scratch it from my parapet, and I come to something funny. I strike my briquet, and there is a Boche's face all frozen and earthy and dead and greeny-white in the flame from my briquet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the germ}} of my great discovery. But {{you are wrong}} {{to say that we}} cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an {{incident}} very vividly <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?' ...|$|E
60|$|In casting {{about for}} some term or {{figure of speech}} in which to {{describe}} the impression produced on me at that moment, I think of waspish, and, better still, avispada--literally the same word in Spanish, not having precisely the same meaning nor ever applied contemptuously--only to reject both after a moment's reflection. Yet <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image of an irritated wasp as perhaps offering the best illustration; of some large tropical wasp advancing angrily towards me, as I have witnessed a hundred times, not exactly flying, but moving rapidly, half running and half flying, over the ground, with loud and angry buzz, the glistening wings open and agitated; beautiful beyond most animated creatures in its sharp but graceful lines, polished surface, and varied brilliant colouring, and that wrathfulness that fits it so well and seems to give it additional lustre.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Pension Beaurepas, {{and when}} {{an hour later}} I left it with my luggage these {{interesting}} friends had not returned.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of a large enclosure, with some big buildings. Perhaps I can look at them better as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Boston." ...|$|R
