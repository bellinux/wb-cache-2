5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> reasoning.|$|E

25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference, although it requires establishing a prior probability.|$|E

In 1960 Theodore Levitt argued that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> the production orientation was also referred to as marketing myopia in an article of the same name by Levitt.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E
25|$|Reverse {{inference}} {{demonstrates the}} logical <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> affirming {{what you just}} found, although this logic could be supported by instances where a certain outcome is generated solely by a specific occurrence. With regard to the brain and brain function it is seldom that a particular brain region is activated solely by one cognitive process. Some suggestions to improve the legitimacy of reverse inference have included both increasing the selectivity of response in the brain region of interest and increasing the prior probability of the cognitive process in question. However, Poldrack suggests that reverse inference should be used merely {{as a guide to}} direct further inquiry rather than a direct means to interpret results.|$|E

25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be good for the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E

Lisa attempts to demonstrate Homer's logical fallacy by the example of a tiger-repellent rock, but it goes over his head.

[...] Isherwood selected the play {{as one of his}} year-end Ten Best Plays of 2012. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter also selected it as among his Ten Best in New York Theater 2012, writing that Akhtar [...] "staked a claim as one of the boldest voices to appear on the playwriting scene in recent years with this stinging swipe at the <b>fallacy</b> <b>of</b> the post-racial nation." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was generally negative. The A.V.

New Yorks Tim Grierson thought it was [...] "the lamest in recent memory" [...] and [...] "a stinker that should have remained safely out of public view". He did however remark that the episode allowed him to see how far the show had improved since its first season. In a slightly more positive review, MTV's Josh Wigler wrote [...] "As far as standard installments of Fringe go, 'Unearthed' ranks somewhere {{in the middle of the}} pack, but the quality diminishes due to its awkward placement in the middle of season two". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 6.4/10, commenting that it was [...] "cheesy, with mediocre writing and some fairly bad performances from the guest supporting cast". Isler found little to redeem the episode, and wished the story's partial focus on the intersection of science and faith had been further explored.|$|E
