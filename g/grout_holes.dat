40|$|The US Army {{required}} {{construction of}} a 2, 787. 1 square meters (30, 000 sf) maintenance facility supported on shallow foundations at the Fort Campbell Military Installation. During the subsurface investigation a seven foot air-filled void was encountered in the bedrock within the building footprint. Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was conducted {{in an attempt to}} determine the lateral extent of the encountered void and to establish the general prevalence of karst features at the site. Due to uncertainty in the subsurface conditions, a rock treatment and soil modification program was developed which consisted of a series of targeted exploratory <b>grout</b> <b>holes</b> advanced in 126 locations in the structural areas of the building footprint. The intent of the program was not to prevent the development of a soil dropout, but to improve the foundation support of the structure so that the facility would perform acceptably if a future soil dropout were to occur during the design life of the facility. This was achieved by targeting each footing with 3 exploratory <b>grout</b> <b>holes.</b> The intent of each grout injection was 1) to identify the top of rock elevation, 2) determine if a karst feature existed, 3) cap the karst bedrock below the footing and treat defects in the rock, and 4) provide localized improvement of soft soils through the use of low mobility grout columns under each footing. Drilling refusal elevations were obtained for every grout hole and were assumed to represent the top of bedrock. Each exploratory hole was closely monitored for pressure and volume in 0. 61 meter (2 -foot) stages. Zones where the bedrock had lower elevations or took excessive grout at low pressures were targeted with additional tertiary holes. The tertiary holes were verified with additional SPT sampling. Documented ground improvement was achieved, evident by increased SPT blow counts ranging between 25 to 50 + post treatment. Based on results from this program, lower grouting pressures could have been utilized as part of the refusal criteria to successfully identify and treat karst features...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{technique}} of splitting grouting for dams {{is one of}} the important technical approaches to improve the inner quality of dam construction. However, the construction cost is too high with the current technological standard, which restricts the further promotion of this technology. Based {{on the assumption that the}} other conditions of construction process remained unchanged and by obeying the law of interaction between the placement of grout-hole spacing and the actual anti-seepage effect during splitting grouting, Mohr-Coulomb Hardening constitutive model was adopted in this paper on the basis of large-scale finite element numerical algorithm. Through the fluid-solid coupling computation of <b>grout</b> <b>holes</b> of different spacing, the distribution law of various factors during splitting grouting, such as the pore water pressure generated by seriflux and the stress and strain of dam, was studied first. Next, the mechanism of reinforcement and seepage of splitting grouting seriflux in soil body was revealed, and the influence of this mechanism on the stability of dam body was also investigated.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} document events that took place during Tunnel F excavation and collate geological and geotechnical data related to the excavation, to aid future tunnel designers and contractors to assess the risk involved with such tunnelling projects. Data relevant to Tunnel F was collected from many personnel involved with the excavation, and from the Hong Kong Geological Survey (HKGS) of the Geotechnical Engineering Office. Geological maps, ground investigation data, tunnel mapping records, ground water inflow records and grouting records were reviewed and used to summarise the ground conditions and to analyse various potential relationships. Knowledge of ground conditions is the most important requirement for any tunnelling project. This dissertation addresses the differences between actual and predicted ground conditions and the consequences of lack of ground investigation data. The major difference between predicted and observed ground conditions during Tunnel F excavation was the amount of water ingress into the tunnel. Hundreds of liters per minute of water at up to 13 bar pressure was encountered from a few probe and <b>grout</b> <b>holes.</b> In the Tolo Channel Fault area, low Q values and very high ground water inflows were experienced, and heavy temporary support and large grout volumes were required to complete the tunnel. published_or_final_versionApplied GeosciencesMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E

The field operations of the investigation to obtain observational information and to secure samples for the laboratory testing include observation of rain gauge and river gauge readings, taking river water samples, digging test pits, drilling <b>grout</b> <b>holes,</b> opening drifts, digging borrow pits and conducting detailed topographical surveys. Laboratory tests are conducted on the samples {{and the results are}} plotted in graphs. Rainfall and run-off statistics are plotted in graphs. Observational information of geology is plotted in log sheets and the field data of survey works is made use of for the preparation of the topographical maps. From the results of the investigation it is found that the Hirakud Dam has a firm foundation and there is sufficient quantity of material for the embankment at site. The annual rainfall is 47. 49 inches yielding a run-off of 50 million sore feet over a catchment area of 32, 200 square miles. The stability of the embankment is computed by the slip circle method and the seepage water from the flow net method. The dam is designed for 100 years with a reservoir capacity of 5. 98 million acre feet at the maximum water level elevation 625 feet, the bed level being elevation 500 feet. The dead storage is 2. 24 million acre feet corresponding to elevation 590 feet, and the maximum submerged area corresponding elevation 625 feet is 150, 380 acres. The minimum factor of safety for the upstream slope is 1. 68 and that for the downstream slope is 1. 19. The seepage water is 0. 264 cubic feet per lineal foot per year. The dam is to be constructed as per the design and the specifications. The compaction is attained by the mechanical effort at the optimum moisture content. The mechanical effort is influenced by the type of roller, its weight and the number of passes. Field control is affected by vigilant supervision, needle penetration, ring test and sand test. The construction is to be carried out according to a plan of seven stages. A comparison and contrast is drawn between the U. S.
