5000|$|In early vessels, {{from the}} 19th century until about 1950, the device usually {{consisted}} of a round dial about nine inches (~20 centimetres) in diameter with a knob at the center attached {{to one or more}} handles, and an <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> {{on the face of the}} dial. There would also be a revolutions per minute indicator, worked by a hand crank. Modern E.O.T.s on vessels which still use them use electronic light and sound signals.|$|E
5000|$|The Post Instrument was {{introduced}} {{in an era when}} sound locating was still common, and some techniques for measuring the angle by sound were developed. This basically consisted of moving the horizontal slider until the <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> was over the [...] "sound line", a circle on the map representing a [...] distance around the post. The operator would then rotate the sights horizontally and vertically to try to point the sights in the direction they estimated the sound to be coming from. Instead of using the map, the operator instead called the horizontal and vertical angles to their operations room. The horizontal angle could be read off a scale around {{the outer edge of the}} map, but the vertical angle was instead measured by dropping the last three zeros of the altitude measurement, so if the sights were over the 14,000 foot marker, they would call in [...] "angle 14".|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of terminology dictionaries including Galician {{as a working}} language has undergone significant development since 1980. Recent Galician terminographic work, generated within the linguistic normalization process, has been analyzed in publications in which this fact is related to language planning (e. g. Rodríguez Río 1996; Galanes 2003). Meanwhile, theoretical changes have occurred in terminology science, especially since Cabré 1999 a, incorporating a social and communicative perspective into the treatment of terminological units. These innovations are being reflected in current applied work on terminology, {{especially with regard to}} how the relationship between terms and concepts is formulated (synonymy, polysemy, etc.), variation in terms and concepts, and the choice of sources of terminology, which are now corpus-based. The time has come for a re-evaluation of Galician terminography work in the light of these new developments, taking into account the new communicative perspective and aiming at interlingual mediation, with special attention to the quality of dictionaries. For this purpose, we have designed an evaluation system based on international <b>indicators</b> (<b>Pointer</b> 1995), communicatively oriented methods and the latest international standards (ISO) on terminographic work. The results findings of this study will affect the design of such work in the future...|$|R
40|$|An <b>indicator</b> is a <b>pointer.</b> It {{can be a}} measurement, a number, a fact, {{an opinion}} or a {{perception}} that points to a specific condition or situation, and measures changes in that condition or situation over time. Indicators can be quantitative or qualitative. In this case, the term relates to assessing aspects of gender (in) equality that can be measured, quantified or systematised...|$|R

The whole assembly is mounted on a floating pontoon that rotates every 12 hours giving a fourth time <b>indicator</b> as a <b>pointer</b> sweeps past Roman numerals placed in the water around the fountain's perimeter.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a proposed acceleration-type take-off indicator were observed during take-off runs of a large jet airplane. The instrument performed its function satisfactorily. It showed an essentially constant reading, which agreed closely with the predicted value, throughout the take-off except for about the first 135 feet of the ground roll during which the starting windup of the <b>indicator</b> <b>pointer</b> occurred. Although oscillating longitudinal accelerations at the instrument location were as much as +/- 50 percent of the steady-state acceleration, the instrument showed only small excursions from the mean reading equivalent to not more than +/- 5 percent of the mean reading and {{was considered to be}} satisfactorily readable...|$|E
50|$|As bombers {{grew and}} multi-place {{aircraft}} became common, {{it was no}} longer possible for the pilot and bombardier to share the same instrument, and hand signals were no longer visible if the bombardier was below the pilot in the nose. A variety of solutions using dual optics or similar systems were suggested in the post-war era, but none of these became widely used. This led to the introduction of the pilot direction <b>indicator,</b> an electrically-driven <b>pointer</b> which the bomb aimer used to indicate corrections from a remote location in the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|A typical light-airplane VOR indicator, {{sometimes}} called an [...] "omni-bearing indicator" [...] or OBI {{is shown in}} the illustration {{at the top of this}} entry. It consists of a knob to rotate an [...] "Omni Bearing Selector" [...] (OBS), the OBS scale around the outside of the instrument, and a vertical course deviation <b>indicator</b> or (CDI) <b>pointer.</b> The OBS is used to set the desired course, and the CDI is centred when the aircraft is on the selected course, or gives left/right steering commands to return to the course. An [...] "ambiguity" [...] (TO-FROM) indicator shows whether following the selected course would take the aircraft to, or away from the station. The indicator may also include a glideslope pointer for use when receiving full ILS signals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an auto-recognition method for pointer-type meter based on computer vision. Two calibrated cameras {{are located in}} the right and left sides of the meter to capture the meter displayed images. In each displayed image, the fast Hough transform method is used to locate the approximate pointer area and then the least squares fitting method is used to determine the precise line that represents the <b>pointer</b> <b>indicator.</b> Two precise lines obtained from both right and left displayed images are reconstructed in three-dimensional space according to the epipolar constraint. The line reconstructed is then projected into the target plane to determine the true indication of the meter. Experiments show that the proposed method works very well for the dial pointer identification. The maximum uncertainty in the determination of the pointer’s indication is less than the human eye can discriminate. Index Terms—binocular vision, three-dimensional reconstruction, fast Hough transform, least squares fitting I...|$|R
40|$|Eine laufende Raumbeobachtung war für eine räumlich orientierte Politik und Planung schon immer von Bedeutung, lieferte sie ihr doch ausreichende Daten und Informationen über räumliche Entwicklungen. In den letzten Jahren sind mit dem „Monitoring“ und „Controlling“ neue Begriffe in der räumlichen Diskussion aufgetaucht, die teilweise auch für Raumbeobachtung {{verwendet}} werden. Der vorliegende Beitrag setzt sich zunächst mit den Begrifflichkeiten auseinander und diskutiert die Frage, ob auf die Raumbeobachtung neue Anforderungen durch neue Planungs- und damit verbundene Regionalisierungsansätze zukommen. Im Mittelpunkt stehen dabei die Rolle von Indikatoren bzw. Indikatorensystemen als Anzeiger räumlicher Entwicklungen sowie deren Grenzen. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird schließlich der Frage nachgegangen, wie indikatorengestützte Raumbeobachtungssysteme grundsätzlich ausgestaltet sein müssen, um dem Informations- und Evaluationsbedarf für die bisherigen formellen und für neue Planungsansätze gerecht zu werden. Dabei wird auf eine inhaltliche Beschreibung und Diskussion einzelner Indikatoren bzw. Indikatorenbündel verzichtet. Continuous spatial “observation” {{has always}} been regarded as an important basis for spatial policy and planning, and the data and information it has consistently supplied on spatial developments {{have been seen as}} adequate. More recently, however, with the emergence of “monitoring” and “controlling” a number of new terms have gained currency in German planning discourse which, to some extent, are also used to refer to spatial observation. This paper begins with a critical discussion of terminology and poses the question as to whether spatial observation is now subject to new demands as a result of new approaches to planning and the associated prominence given to regionalisation. The main focus is on the role – and the limitations – of indicators and/or systems of <b>indicators</b> as a <b>pointer</b> to spatial developments. This provides the background for a more fundamental discussion on the essential design features of indicator-based systems for spatial observation {{if they are to be}} fit for the purpose of supplying the information and evaluation required both in the more familiar formal approaches to planning and equally in connection with more novel approaches. The author opts not to provide substantive descriptions or discussion on individual indicators or bundles of indicators...|$|R
