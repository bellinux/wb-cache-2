40|$|Both {{leader and}} <b>follower</b> {{emotional}} intelligence (EI) have been posited {{in the literature}} to influence leader–member exchange (LMX). We collected data from 203 independent leader–follower dyads working in the insurance industry in Malaysia and examined relationships between leader and <b>follower</b> trait-EI and <b>follower</b> outcomes mediated through LMX. We added a further dimension to our study by comparing results using <b>follower</b> and then a dyadic measure of LMX. We found that leader EI predicted a dyadic measure of LMX, whilst only <b>follower</b> EI predicted a <b>follower</b> measure of LMX. As hypothesized, leader EI had both direct and indirect effects on <b>follower</b> job performance. By contrast, <b>follower</b> EI demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on <b>follower</b> well-being. We found a dyadic measure of LMX to be a stronger predictor of <b>follower</b> job performance, well-being, and turnover intention than a <b>follower</b> only measure. Our results suggest that significant relationships between leader and <b>follower</b> trait EI and LMX depend on whether <b>follower</b> or dyadic measures of LMX are used. The study {{draws attention to the}} importance of emphasizing the level at which EI effects are expected to operate in LMX...|$|R

Using a sample of 420 leader-follower dyads from an energy company in mainland China, we found that <b>follower</b> relational {{identification with the}} leader mediates the transformational leadership-follower creativity relationship, and this mediating relationship is conditional on the moderator variable of <b>follower</b> perceptions of leader creativity expectations for the path from <b>follower</b> relational identification to <b>follower</b> creativity. These results contribute to the literature by clarifying why (through relational identification) and when (high creativity expectations set by the leader) transformational leadership is positively related to <b>follower</b> creativity.

40|$|The author {{intended}} {{to examine the}} effects of authentic leadership, transformational leadership, and transactional leadership on <b>follower</b> moral identity and <b>follower</b> moral decision intention, and the influence processes through which authentic leadership, transformational leadership, and transactional leadership impacts <b>follower</b> moral decision intention. More specifically, the author tested whether <b>follower</b> moral identity mediates the effect of authentic and transformational leadership on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention and whether moral intensity moderates the effect of authentic leadership, transformational leadership, and transactional leadership on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention. ^ Based on three pilot tests with undergraduate samples and one experimental study with a real field sample (i. e., teachers in public settings), it was found that authentic and transformational leadership has a positive effect on <b>follower</b> moral identity and <b>follower</b> moral decision intention. Moreover, it was also found that <b>follower</b> moral identity mediates the effects of both authentic leadership and transformational leadership on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention. Contrary to the expectation, transactional leadership had a negative effect on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention. Furthermore, moral intensity moderated the effect of authentic leadership and transformational leadership on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention in that the effects of authentic leadership and transformational leadership on <b>follower</b> moral decision intention are stronger when moral intensity is low. ^ This study has a number of theoretical contributions and practical implications. This study made a significant theoretical contribution to both the leadership area and the ethical decision making field in that it has introduced a testable theoretical model to explain how authentic and transformational leadership affects <b>follower</b> moral identity and moral decision intention. This study also made a significant theoretical contribution to the moral development field in that it took the leadership factor into account and generalized to working adults in organizations. One unique practical implication is that, in order to promote <b>follower</b> moral decision intention, it is necessary to promote <b>follower</b> moral identity. Another important practical implication is that organizations need to develop authentic and transformational leadership across different organizational levels in order to develop <b>follower</b> moral identity and <b>follower</b> moral decision intention, which could help pave the way for an organization 2 ̆ 7 s sustainable development. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship of leader-follower personality similarity (supplementary fit) and dissimilarity (complementary fit) with two employee outcomes: <b>follower</b> satisfaction with the leader and <b>follower</b> commitment to the organization. With {{the exception of one}} study (Glomb & Welsh, in press), prior research on leader-follower personality fit focused primarily on personality similarity (e. g., Bauer & Green, 1996; Deluga, 1998), yielding few clear, consistent results. These studies ignored the possibility that it might be personality differences that lead to positive employee outcomes. To my knowledge, only one study exists that proposed positive outcomes for leader-follower personality dissimilarity (i. e. Glomb & Welsh, in press). In this dissertation I extend past research by suggesting that personality dissimilarity may have a significant relationship with <b>follower</b> outcomes. Further, I suggest that the direction of the difference between a leader and a <b>follower</b> (which person has which characteristic) may also affect the outcome. Drawing upon similarity attraction theory (Byrne, 1971) and implicit leadership theory (e. g., Lord, 1985), I test competing hypotheses about {{the relationship of}} leader-follower personality fit with <b>follower</b> outcomes using three dimensions (extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability) from the five-factor model of personality (Goldberg, 1992). With a sample of 778 leader-follower dyads, this longitudinal study also extends past research by using a relatively new statistical technique, polynomial regression analyses (Edwards, 1993). This technique overcomes some of the difficulties associated with more traditional ways of assessing fit, such as difference scores. In addition, I use hierarchical linear modeling to address nonindependence in my sample. However, results revealed that leader-follower personality fit was not significantly related to <b>follower</b> satisfaction with the leader nor to <b>follower</b> commitment to the organization. That is, neither leader-follower personality similarity nor dissimilarity for any of the three dimensions (extraversion, conscientiousness, emotional stability) was significantly related to <b>follower</b> satisfaction with a leader nor with <b>follower</b> commitment to the organization. Significant main effects, however, were found for <b>follower</b> personality. When I tested the personality dimensions one at a time, I found that <b>follower</b> extraversion and emotional stability were significantly related to <b>follower</b> satisfaction with the leader and that <b>follower</b> extraversion, conscientiousness, and emotional stability were significantly related to <b>follower</b> commitment to the organization. Further, when I included the dimensions of agreeableness and openness in post hoc analyses, I found a significant relationship between <b>follower</b> agreeableness and both of the <b>follower</b> outcomes. However, when I included all five personality dimensions in a simultaneous regression I found significant relationships only for <b>follower</b> emotional stability with <b>follower</b> satisfaction with the leader and for <b>follower</b> conscientiousness and agreeableness with <b>follower</b> commitment to the organization.

The super source <b>follower</b> is a circuit formed using negative feedback through another MOSFET.
