5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds.

This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E
40|$|Capsule <b>Iberian</b> <b>Chiffchaffs</b> Phylloscopus (collybita) brehmii are genetically, morphologically and bioacoustically {{different}} from European Chiffchaffs (P [c. ] collybita). Aim To examine {{the difference in}} migratory pattern between brehmii and collybita. Methods We inferred variation in distance of migration between brehmii and collybita by analysing differences in flight-related morphology (wing-length, wing shape and tail-length) between individuals breeding or wintering in the Iberian Peninsula. Results Controlling for body size and allometry of feather dimensions, birds captured in spring had more pointed wings (more concave wing shapes and pointed wing tips) and a shorter tail than birds caught in winter, although no spring-to-winter difference was found for wing-length. Conclusion Iberian breeders appear better suited to long-distance migration (their traits are likely to give a higher speed and a lower energy consumption during long non-stop flights) than wintering individuals, which strongly supports the hypothesis that brehmii move south of the Sahara in autumn and are substituted by central European collybita populations in winter. This different migration pattern of brehmii and collybita {{has important implications for}} the maintenance of differentiation in their contact zone, because selection against hybrids with maladaptive, intermediate migratory behaviours might contribute to reproductive isolation...|$|R
500|$|P. ibericus, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> is brighter, greener on the rump, and yellower below than P. collybita, {{and has a}} tit-tit-tit-tswee-tswee song. It was {{initially}} named P. brehmii, but the type specimen of that taxon is not an <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff.</b> This species is found in Portugal and Spain, west of a line stretching roughly from the western Pyrenees via the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean; the Iberian and common chiffchaffs co-occur in a narrow band along this line. Apart from the northernmost section, the precise course of the contact zone is not well documented. A long-distance migrant, this species winters in western Africa. It differs from P. c. collybita in vocalisations, external morphology, and mtDNA sequences. There is [...] hybridization in the contact zone, almost always between male P. ibericus and female P. c. collybita, [...] and hybrids apparently show much decreased fitness; [...] hybrid females appear to be sterile according to Haldane's Rule. Regarding the latter aspect, {{it is interesting to}} note that the <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> apparently is the oldest lineage of chiffchaffs and quite distinct from the common chiffchaff.|$|E

50|$|The Canary Islands {{chiffchaff}} {{is similar}} to the common chiffchaff and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> but compared to the common chiffchaff it has a longer bill, shorter wings and a longer tail.

50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{has always}} enjoyed {{a reputation for}} rare birds. As well as those documented above, it attracted two black-winged stilts in 1918; the first great white egret in London in 1997; the blue-winged teal in 1996; the lesser scaup in 2003; and penduline tits in 1996 and 1997. Remarkably for an inland site, it also attracts rare warblers, notably the aquatic warbler in 1955; Hume's warbler in 2004; and yellow-browed warblers in 1994 and 2003; however, most significant was an <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> on 3 June 1972, the first recorded in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The type {{forests are}} made up of laurel-leaved {{evergreen}} hardwood trees, reaching up to 40 m in height when older. Many of the species are endemic to islands, and harbour a rich biota of understorey plants, invertebrates, some species of lizards (Lacerta lepida, Podarcis bocagei, Chalcides striatus), slowworms (Anguis fragilis), and snakes, (Elaphe scalaris, Coronella girondica, Natrix maura). The island has some goats and wild boars (Sus scrofa), wild horses lived there until recently (Crocidura russula, Erinaceus europaeus, Talpa occidentalis), bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Eptesicus serotinus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), feral cats (Felix catus), feral mink (Mustela vison), rabbits, mice, rats and birds such as <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff,</b> the coal tit, the great tit, woodpecker, Eurasian wryneck, collared dove, common wood pigeon, blackbird, Scolopax rusticola, greenfinch, warbler, finch, saithe, stonechat, robin, goldfinch, wagtail, black redstart, buzzard, goshawk, and peregrine falcon. Besides many seabirds species such as cormorants and shorebirds take refuge on the island and several species of gulls nest in the breeding season.|$|E

40|$|Differential {{migration}} is a widespread, but poorly understood, phenomenon in birds. In this paper, we present the first detailed field study of differential migration in the Old World warbler (Sylviidae) family. We studied two chiffchaff Phylloscopus [collybita] semispecies: the common chiffchaff P. [c. ] collybita and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> P. [c. ] ibericus. Using data collected at several latitudes in Europe and Africa, we present convincing evidence for differential distance migration of sexes in chiffchaffs, with females moving further than males. Interestingly, {{while there was}} a pronounced gradient in the sex-ratios in Europe and North Africa (with an increasing proportion of females with declining latitude), no clear pattern was found south of the Sahara, where sex-ratios were more male-biased than predicted by a simple latitude model. This suggests that, amongst the chiffchaffs wintering in West Africa, a large proportion is composed by Iberian birds, and provides support to previous suggestions that Iberian chiffchaffs are long distance migrants. Results from detailed studies in Senegal also show that chiffchaffs display differential timing of spring migration, with males leaving the winter quarters considerably earlier than females. The results are discussed in th...|$|E
40|$|In {{the western}} Pyrenees (Southwest France and Northwest Spain), a narrow hybrid zone {{exists between the}} common {{chiffchaff}} Phylloscopus (collybita) collybita and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> Phylloscopus (c.) brehmii. In this zone, which is approximately 20 km wide, mixed matings and individuals singing the songs of both taxa occur at substantial frequencies (24 and 8. 6 %, respectively), suggesting frequent hybridization. Previous studies have shown very weak mitochondrial gene flow (Nm = 0. 065), whereas four microsatellites suggested much higher nuclear gene flow (Nm = 4. 9). In this study we used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method {{in order to identify}} hybrids and early backcrosses. We typed 91 birds from both allopatric and sympatric areas for 12 informative AFLP markers (of > 141 polymorphic fragments), obtained by screening 13 AFLP primer combinations. These individuals were previously typed for song (brehmii, collybita or mixed singers), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype and allelic genotypes at four microsatellite loci. Assignment tests demonstrated that in the zone of sympatry, a substantial number of intermediate genotypes existed among the birds previously believed to be pure collybita and brehmii, based on song and mtDNA haplotype. The majority of the mixed singers had intermediate genotypes. Our data suggest that the fraction of the adult population having a hybrid origin (hybrids or backcrosses) is in the order of 10 %. With such a frequency of genetic hybrids, there would have been much more mtDNA introgression than observed, had female hybrids been perfectly fertile/viable. This result is consistent with male-biased gene flow and Haldane's rule...|$|E
