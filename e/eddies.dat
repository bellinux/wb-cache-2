5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing <b>eddies</b> and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by <b>eddies</b> and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from <b>eddies</b> between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, it would seem that the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Titanics wreck, in addition to the common assumption that she had sunk in one piece, it had been widely believed that conditions at 12,000 feet down would preserve the ship virtually intact. The water is bitterly cold at only about , there is no light and the high pressure was thought to be likely to lower oxygen and salinity levels to the point that organisms {{would not be able to}} gain a foothold on the wreck. Titanic would effectively be in a deep freeze. The reality has turned out to be very different, and the ship has increasingly deteriorated since she sank in April 1912. Her gradual decay is due to a number of different processes– physical, chemical and biological. She is situated on an undulating, gently sloping area of seabed in Titanic Canyon which is swept by the Western Boundary Current. <b>Eddies</b> from the current flow constantly across the wreck, scouring the sea bed and keeping sediment from building up over the hull. The current is strong and often changeable, gradually opening up holes in the ship's hull. Salt corrosion eats away at the hull and it is also affected by galvanic corrosion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{expression}} for the <b>eddy</b> current loss in solid rectangular cores is obtained using linear electromagnetic field analysis. Wherefrom text book formula for <b>eddy</b> current loss is derived highlighting various assumptions involved. To get {{an insight into}} the current interruption phenomena, electromagnetic fields in a composite rectangular core are analyzed. It is concluded that the reduction in <b>eddy</b> current loss in a laminated cores is basically due to the insertion of distributed capacitors in <b>eddy</b> current paths. Presence of these capacitors increases the impedance of the <b>eddy</b> current path, reducing <b>eddy</b> currents and <b>eddy</b> current loss. 1...|$|R
40|$|HF radar {{measurement}} in the Tsushima Strait reveals frequent {{appearance of}} anti-clockwise <b>eddy</b> in an eastern channel of the Tsushima Strait. In this study, {{spatial and temporal}} variations of this anti-clockwise <b>eddy</b> are investigated. The <b>eddy</b> generally appears from {{the southern part of}} the eastern coast of Tsushima Island and is shed to the northeast by the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC). Three modes (4 ～ 6, 10 ～ 12, and more than 30 days) are found in frequency distribution of <b>eddy</b> formation intervals. Location of the <b>eddy</b> and the highest mode of the <b>eddy</b> formation interval suggest that the <b>eddy</b> is lee-side <b>eddy</b> formed behind Tsushima Island by the incoming TWC. Second mode indicates that the <b>eddy</b> formation is affected by variations of intensities of TWC and tidal currents. The third mode corresponds to seasonal variation of the <b>eddy</b> generation, which is probably caused by a seasonal variation of vertical structure of TWC...|$|R

25|$|<b>Eddies</b> are formed, like hydraulics, on the {{downstream}} {{face of an}} obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, <b>eddies</b> swirl on the horizontal surface of the water. Typically, they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested—a nice place to rest or to make one's way upstream. However, in very powerful water, <b>eddies</b> can have powerful, swirling currents which can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult.|$|E
25|$|In a {{turbulent}} flow, {{there is a}} range of scales of the time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called <b>eddies)</b> are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial smoke stack, the largest scales of fluid motion are {{as big as the}} diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a smoke stack, the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or <b>eddies,</b> in addition to large bulky <b>eddies.</b> In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest <b>eddies</b> will always be the same size; the smallest <b>eddies</b> are determined by the Reynolds number.|$|E

Thus, the latitude of Loop Current retreat after <b>eddy</b> separation can be used to forecast the period of the next Loop Current <b>eddy</b> separation cycle.

40|$|In {{simulations}} {{of a wide}} range of circulations with an idealized general circulation model, clear scaling laws of dry atmospheric macroturbulence emerge that are consistent with nonlinear eddy–eddy interactions being weak. The simulations span several decades of <b>eddy</b> energies and include Earth-like circulations and circulations with multiple jets and belts of surface westerlies in each hemisphere. In the simulations, the <b>eddy</b> available potential energy and the barotropic and baroclinic <b>eddy</b> kinetic energy scale linearly with each other, with the ratio of the baroclinic <b>eddy</b> kinetic energy to the barotropic <b>eddy</b> kinetic energy and <b>eddy</b> available potential energy decreasing with increasing planetary radius and rotation rate. Mean values of the meridional <b>eddy</b> flux of surface potential temperature and of the vertically integrated convergence of the meridional <b>eddy</b> flux of zonal momentum generally scale with functions of the <b>eddy</b> energies and the energy-containing <b>eddy</b> length scale, with a few exceptions in simulations with statically near-neutral or neutral extratropical thermal stratifications. <b>Eddy</b> energies scale with the mean available potential energy and with a function of the supercriticality, a measure of the near-surface slope of isentropes. Strongly baroclinic circulations form an extended regime in which <b>eddy</b> energies scale linearly with the mean available potential energy. Mean values of the <b>eddy</b> flux of surface potential temperature and of the vertically integrated <b>eddy</b> momentum flux convergence scale similarly with the mean available potential energy and other mean fields. The scaling laws for the dependence of <b>eddy</b> fields on mean fields exhibit a regime transition between a regime in which the extratropical thermal stratification and tropopause height are controlled by radiation and convection and a regime in which baroclinic entropy fluxes modify the extratropical thermal stratification and tropopause height. At the regime transition, for example, the dependence of the <b>eddy</b> flux of surface potential temperature and the dependence of the vertically integrated <b>eddy</b> momentum flux convergence on mean fields changes -— a result with implications for climate stability and for the general circulation of an atmosphere, including its tropical Hadley circulation...|$|R
