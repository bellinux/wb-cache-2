25|$|The John Reid Annexe is {{situated}} {{directly behind the}} John Reid Pavilion with the ridge of the Annexe roof at 90 degrees to the main ridge of the John Reid Pavilion. The Annexe is of single-skin timber construction, clad externally with chamferboards, with horizontal boarding on some interior walls.

The Annexe can be accessed at both ends via steel roller doors and the doors lead through to the John Reid Pavilion to the northwest and Building No.7 to the southeast.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the area}} {{supports}} beef cattle ranching, and dairy farming is common across the area. Dairy farms are usually cooperative affairs, with small farms selling to a corporate wholesaler who packages product under a common brand for retail sales. Petroleum exploration and extraction also {{takes place in the}} Oklahoma portion of the Ozarks, {{as well as in the}} east half of the Boston Mountains in Arkansas. Logging of both softwood and <b>hardwood</b> <b>timber</b> species on both private land and in the National Forests has long been an important economic activity.|$|E
25|$|The igloo {{is a form}} {{of light}} nailed <b>hardwood</b> <b>timber</b> arch construction, where each arch is made up of two half arches more or less freely pinned at two {{abutments}} close to ground level and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and bottom chord level and each truss consists of a top and bottom chord laced together in arch form. As a result, each half truss is made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed in position to form a curved open-latticed box truss.|$|E
25|$|Hobart Town {{had become}} a town {{dependent}} on external trade. Although many of the primary industries were highly successful, they were never conducted on a scale sufficient to bring long lasting wealth. By the 1830s, the sealing industry had petered out, and although whaling persisted, {{it was on a}} scale diminished from the first twenty years. Despite the decline in these industries, the export of Tasmanian wool continued to thrive. New industries were required to replace the declining trades, and shipbuilding was one of the new successes for Hobart Town in the 1830s. The quality of the island's <b>hardwood</b> <b>timber</b> resources, combined with excellent port facilities and access to major shipping routes meant that by 1850, Hobart Town was producing more wooden ships than all other Australian ports combined. Hobart built ships plied all of the world's oceans, and could be found as far a-field as the United States and Europe.|$|E
50|$|For the wharves, a {{reinforced}} concrete base was {{laid on the}} rock at the river's edge, with timber piles rammed into the riverbed.

Hundreds of thousands of feet of <b>timber</b> (mostly <b>hardwoods</b> such as ironbark, blue gum, yellow stringybark, spotted gum and messmate) were required to build the berths.|$|R
50|$|Kursk Oblast {{is a part}} of the Eastern European forest-steppe. One-quarter of Kursk oblast {{was once}} heavily wooded. <b>Hardwood</b> <b>timbers</b> {{included}} oak, ash, and elm.

50|$|The Winchester & Western was {{initially}} incorporated on August 16, 1916 {{for the purpose}} of tapping the forests of southeastern Hampshire County, West Virginia and southwestern Frederick County, Virginia in order to supply railroad ties to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The idea of building such a conduit to tap these resources had been conceived during World War I when the traffic on the railways of the United States had been greatly increased. More railroad ties were needed to both construct new railways and maintain the lines already in use. A way to transport the <b>hardwood</b> <b>timbers</b> to the tie mills in Winchester was needed, and so the Winchester and Western was conceived.|$|R
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a hatchway in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a hatch door on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with diagonal bracing. The dome is made from eight steel segments bolted together with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a <b>hardwood</b> <b>timber</b> floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an igloo design. The igloo {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a ready made apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber box frame design and were clad with galvanised iron, but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various igloo designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used standard grade Group C <b>hardwood</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many {{parts of}} the hotel was {{refurbished}} during the 1930s. The lounge was renovated in 1932, {{under the supervision of}} local architect POE Hawkes, when a timber floor and wall panelling was introduced, and fibrous cement was used to clad the ceiling. A variety of locally grown <b>hardwood</b> <b>timbers,</b> including mountain ash, red gum, spotted gum and iron bark supplied by Hyne and Son timber merchants, were used to create the striking parquetry floor. Tenders were called, again by architect Philip Oliver Ellard Hawkes, on September 21, 1934 for the erection of a cantilevered awning clad with Wunderlich pressed metal panels {{to the front of the}} hotel, though this was not erected until 1939, when the shop fronts were modernised.

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{softwood}} and <b>hardwoods</b> <b>timbers</b> {{are used as}} ties, oak, jarrah and karri being popular hardwoods, although increasingly difficult to obtain, especially from sustainable sources. Some lines use softwoods, including Douglas fir; while they {{have the advantage of}} accepting treatment more readily, they are more susceptible to wear but are cheaper, lighter (and therefore easier to handle) and more readily available. Softwood is treated, while creosote is the most common preservative for railway ties, preservatives are also sometimes used such as pentachlorophenol, chromated copper arsenate and a few other preservatives. Sometimes non-toxic preservatives are used, such as copper azole or micronized copper. New boron-based wood preserving technology is being employed by major US railroads in a dual treatment process in order to extend the life of wood ties in wet areas. Some timbers (such as sal, mora, jarrah or azobé) are durable enough that they can be used untreated.|$|R

5000|$|Cryptotermes brevis infests sound {{softwood}} and <b>hardwood</b> <b>timbers,</b> both structural wood {{in buildings}} and moveable objects. Several colonies can co-exist {{in a single}} structure and objects as small as picture frames can be attacked. The pseudergates excavate galleries through the timber but leave a thin veneer of surface wood intact. One wooden door was found to house twenty colonies, judging {{by the number of}} reproductive pairs of termites found inside. In the later stages of an infestation the surface of the object may bulge or blister. Small holes known as [...] "kick-out holes" [...] 1 to 2 mm in diameter are sometimes made through which faecal pellets can be pushed out, accumulating in a conical, dusty pile below. The pellets are hexagonal in cross section and vary in colour, having one rounded and one tapered end, a shape characteristic of Cryptotermes brevis. Other signs of infestation are the swarming of alates or the presence of shed wings. Cryptotermes brevis is more destructive in habitations than other species in the genus Cryptotermes which require a moister environment. In the United States, this termite causes damage in excess of $100 million annually, and a great deal more than this worldwide.|$|R
