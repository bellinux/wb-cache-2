5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans.

The grape phylloxera was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E.
