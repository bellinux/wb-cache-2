50|$|More generally, {{the court}} is {{of the opinion that}} {{allowing}} patents on <b>higher</b> <b>life</b> forms would involve “a radical departure from the traditional patent regime” and it is for to Parliament to determine whether <b>higher</b> <b>life</b> forms are patentable.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} {{used the}} fact that Parliament enacted the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court’s decision in Pioneer Hi-Bred Ltd. v. Commissioner of Patents to bolster their view that Parliament did not believe the Patent Act was tailored to include <b>higher</b> <b>life</b> forms. Bastarache J. stated that since Parliament enacted specialized legislation to deal with the issues surrounding crossbred plants, a subset of <b>higher</b> <b>life</b> forms, had they wished to extend patentability to other <b>higher</b> <b>life</b> forms, they would have likely done so at the time.|$|R
25|$|In the 1870s, the holiness {{movement}} {{spread to}} Great Britain, {{where it was}} sometimes called the <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> movement after the title of William Boardman's book, The <b>Higher</b> <b>Life.</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> conferences were held at Broadlands and Oxford in 1874 and in Brighton and Keswick in 1875. The Keswick Convention soon became the British headquarters for the movement. The Faith Mission in Scotland was one consequence of the British holiness movement. Another was a flow of influence from Britain back to the United States. In 1874, Albert Benjamin Simpson read Boardman's <b>Higher</b> Christian <b>Life</b> and felt {{the need for such}} a life himself. He went on to found the Christian and Missionary Alliance.|$|R

5000|$|Keswick {{doctrine}} {{has been}} sharply criticized as a disguised form of entire sanctification (or [...] "perfectionism") by other Christian traditions, particularly Calvinism. Princeton theologian B.B. Warfield wrote a trenchant {{attack on the}} Keswick and <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> movement in his two-volume work Studies in Perfectionism, specifically in his articles [...] "The <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> Movement" [...] and [...] "The Victorious Life." [...] W. H. Griffith Thomas responded to Warfield and defended the <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> movement in two articles in the journal Bibliotheca Sacra. [...] Another early opponent of Keswick was J. C. Ryle, who set forth the classic Protestant doctrine of sanctification in his book Holiness {{as an alternative to}} Keswick. More modern defenders of Keswick theology include J. Robertson McQuilkin in the book Five Views of Sanctification, as well as John R. VanGelderen. [...] Modern Reformed criticism of Keswick has come from J. I. Packer, as well as from Andrew Naselli, who critiqued Keswick in his doctoral dissertation on the subject. [...] The <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> and Keswick movement is also critiqued from a non-Reformed, historic Baptist viewpoint by Thomas Ross in his doctoral dissertation The Doctrine of Sanctification: An Exegetical Examination, with Application, in Biblical, Historic Baptist Perspective. Charismatic and Pentecostal authors may critique the <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> movement also as not going far enough, but Pentecostal scholars recognize and appreciate the groundwork laid by <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> advocacy of the continuation of the gifts of healing and miracle-working for the rise of the Pentecostal movement. [...] Modern Keswick writers often affirm that opponents of Keswick misunderstand the <b>Higher</b> <b>Life</b> movement, Keswick critics affirm that they understand the movement very well and that they do not routinely misunderstand Keswick theology.|$|R

This was followed by Orage (1938), opposite Michèle Morgan. The offscreen Boyer was bookish and private, {{far removed from the}} Hollywood <b>high</b> <b>life.</b> But onscreen he made audiences swoon as he romanced Katharine Hepburn in Break of Hearts (1935), Marlene Dietrich in his first Technicolor film, The Garden of Allah (1936), Jean Arthur in History Is Made at Night (1937), Greta Garbo in Conquest (1937), and Irene Dunne in Love Affair (1939).|$|E

The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration. Because of the city and country's low birth rate and <b>high</b> <b>life</b> expectancy, its age structure is similar to a developed country, with Havana having an even higher proportion of elderly than the country as a whole.|$|E

He gained full sponsorship from Coors in 1984 to the tune of $400,000 and won three races – the Michigan 400, the Miller <b>High</b> <b>Life</b> 500, and the American 500.

25|$|Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin {{is by far}} {{the wealthiest}} {{character}} in the play, but comes from the lowest social class. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the <b>high</b> <b>life,</b> {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but there is nothing in the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of doing things.|$|E

The New Economics Foundation (NEF) ranked Costa Rica first in its 2009 Happy Planet Index, and once again in 2012. The index measures the health and happiness they produce per unit of environmental input. According to NEF, Costa Rica's lead is due to its very <b>high</b> <b>life</b> expectancy which is second highest in the Americas, and higher than the United States. The country also experienced well-being higher than many richer nations and a per capita ecological footprint one-third the size of the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Anderson {{closed his}} operation, and Yarborough {{moved to the}} No. 28 Hardee's Chevrolet owned by Harry Ranier, {{competing}} in 16 events. He won four races, including his third Daytona 500, his sixth Atlanta Coca-Cola 500, and swept both events at Michigan, along with three poles. In 1984 he repeated by winning his fourth Daytona 500, becoming the second driver to score back-to-back wins, the Winston 500 at Talladega, a race that featured 75 lead changes, and the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500, along with four poles. Yarborough also captured the IROC VIII championship. In 1985 after his team switched to a Ford, {{he won his first}} Talladega 500 and scored his final win in the Miller <b>High</b> <b>Life</b> 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

25|$|Later in 1864, Farren {{moved to}} the Olympic Theatre, where she stayed for several years, playing {{in a number of}} pieces, {{including}} The Hidden Hand by Tom Taylor; My Wife's Bonnet by John Maddison Morton; the burlesques Prince Camaralzaman, or, the Fairies' Revenge and Faust and Marguerite; and Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, as the Clown. She also played the title role in Lydia Languish, Charlotte in <b>High</b> <b>Life</b> Below Stairs, Nerissa in The Merchant of Venice, Nan in Good for Nothing by J. B. Buckstone, Jo in Nicholas Nickleby, and Sam Willoughby in The Ticket-of-Leave Man, again earning praise for her comic portrayals. The manager of the Olympic, Horace Wigan, and playwright Tom Taylor, each of whom directed shows at the theatre, taught Farren much about stagecraft and encouraged her to experiment and expand her acting. During this time, she also played roles in other theatres, such as Pert in London Assurance in 1866. In the second half of 1868, she joined the company at the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, playing, among other things, Nancy Rouse in a F. C. Burnand's burlesque Fowl Play.|$|E
