5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected <b>gay</b> <b>men,</b> who were seen as an undesirable population, and the <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E

5|$|The city, {{along with}} {{adjacent}} small cities Oakland Park and Wilton Manors, {{is known for}} its large LGBT community and {{has one of the highest}} ratios of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians, with <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> being more largely present, in the United States. The city is also known as a popular vacation spot for gays and lesbians, with many LGBT or LGBT-friendly hotels and guesthouses. Fort Lauderdale hosts the Stonewall Library & Archives, and in neighboring Wilton Manors there is a large LGBT community center, the Pride Center, and the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Openly gay Mattachine Society {{president}} Hal Call, Mattachine {{executive secretary}} Donald Lucas and Mattachine treasurer Les Fisher spoke for <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> The Rejected was unusual for its time {{in that it}} included actual gay people as opposed to only presenting ostensibly heterosexual experts.|$|E

5|$|The {{public image}} of homosexuals changed with liberalized social {{attitudes of the}} late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots {{occurred}} in New York City, marking {{the start of the}} gay rights movement. Though gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church—a congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami—was founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police. Even the depiction of <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. This suggestion conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E

5|$|The Lambda Literary Awards include {{awards for}} science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first {{presented}} in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians and <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given {{based on the}} quality of the writing and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{style of}} manga called Bara, which is {{typically}} written by <b>gay</b> <b>men</b> for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and {{is more likely to}} acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years in}} the making, The Homosexuals went through two {{producers}} and multiple revisions.

All three shows aired in 2015 for a single series.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among <b>gay</b> <b>men.</b> That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E
