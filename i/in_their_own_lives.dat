25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> {{which may not}} be the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.|$|E

By 1874, there were 81 families and about 17 {{percent of the}} men that lived in this community practiced polygamy. The households were simple in structure and were usually two to three bedrooms. There were about three children per mother in every household and polygamous wives lived in the same home as well. Large families in all Mormon communities were regarded as a spiritual practice and the child to woman ratio in Kanab reflected that.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of each school year, Elon University holds a New Student Convocation {{ceremony}} for first year and transfer students. It is held “Under the Oaks” behind the West Dormitory.

Upon Graduation, each student receives an oak sapling, which is supposed to symbolize their growth at the university as well as the growth <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives.</b> The use of the acorn and oak sapling is significant because Elon was named after the Hebrew word for “oak” because of the grove of oak trees it was founded on. The Oak Sapling tradition began in 1991, and the Acorn tradition began in 1999 after Leo Lambert became president of the university.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Lee was {{inducted}} into the Alabama Academy of Honor. In the same year, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book, To Kill a Mockingbird, as the first title of the One City, One Book program. Lee declared that [...] "there is no greater honor the novel could receive". By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states [...] "people just seem to connect with it.

500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> and would feel {{sympathy for the}} characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E

The instrumental backing for [...] "Tighten Up" [...] was provided by the T.S.U. Toronadoes, the group which had developed it <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>live</b> shows before they brought it to Archie Bell & the Drells at the suggestion of Skipper Lee Frazer, a Houston disk jockey who worked with both groups.

500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives</b> ... handled with care and consideration, without all the glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're nothing if not a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{shows how}} Chicanas, like women {{of many other}} ethnicities, {{internalize}} these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman’s hips have: [...] "They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, Rachel says... You need them to dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know." [...] Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her [...] "sexual initiation"—an assault {{by a group of}} Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but [...] "by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
500|$|The show {{features}} classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, {{in combination}} with atypical elements. Much of the series {{is devoted to the}} science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode [...] "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled zeppelin. Campbell told Starlog magazine, [...] "It's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West." [...] The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; {{it is one of the}} few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though [...] "technology-out-of-time" [...] frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> are not exploited further.|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{self-management}} predominantly {{refers to}} education programmes that, theoretically, equip people with chronic disease {{with the necessary}} information and skills to manage <b>their</b> <b>own</b> healthcare, maintain optimal health, and minimize {{the consequences of their}} condition. These programmes are designed, and often delivered, by practitioners. Our research has demonstrated that for consumers, self-management involves navigating and responding to a myriad of information sources and experiences, many of which originate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lived</b> bodily experiences and personal knowledge. In contrast to this organic and dynamic version of self-managing that is naturally practised by consumers, common practitioner and policy representations of self-management tend to discount consumer agency and overlook the daily ways in which people manage <b>their</b> <b>own</b> body, experiences and health choices. We argue that if the self-management movement is to tackle health inequalities (rather than creating new ones), health professionals and policy-makers must examine the potentially damaging assumptions that are inherent in contemporary self-management discourse.

500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> and that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} to the {{memories}} of previous generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores the trauma and memories of the deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend to analyze the character of Harry Potter as he interacts with the memories of the previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through the use of magic. By testifying to the memories of the previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able to break the cycle of violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness to the memories of those with whom they associate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>live</b> and create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R

Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt {{to return to the}} relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Paradise <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue (...) , confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.|$|E

Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided {{the main purpose}} of The Rattle Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader: [...] "Arbitrary riches." [...] Heaney commented [...] "the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement." [...] It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>lives,</b> as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted [...] "less of a carnival, more like a checklist."
