40|$|Fire {{safety is}} one of the most {{important}} issues for manned space missions. A likely cause of fires in spacecraft is wire insulation combustion in electrical system. Regarding the wire insulation combustion it important to know the effect of low external flow on the combustion because of the presence of ventilation flow in spacecraft. Although, there are many researches on flame spreading over solid material at low external flows under microgravity, research dealing with wire insulation is very limited. An example of wire insulation combustion in microgravity is the Space Shuttle experiments carried out by Greenberg et al. However, the number of experiments was very limited. Therefore, the effect of low flow velocity is still not clear. The authors have reported results on flame spreading over ETFE (ethylene - tetrafluoroetylene) insulated wire in a quiescent atmosphere in microgravity by 10 seconds drop tower. The authors also performed experiments of polyethylene insulated nichrom wire combustion in low flow velocity under microgravity. The results suggested that flame spread rate had maximum value in low flow velocity condition. Another interesting issue is the effect of <b>dilution</b> <b>gas,</b> especially CO 2, which is used for fire extinguisher in ISS. There are some researches working on <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> effect on flame spreading over solid material in quiescent atmosphere in microgravity. However the research with low external flow is limited and, of course, the research discussing a relation of the appearance of maximum wire flammability in low flow velocity region with different <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> cannot be found yet. The present paper, therefore, investigates the effect of opposed flow with different <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> on flame spreading over ETFE insulated wire and change in the presence of the maximum flammability depending on the <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> type is discussed within the limit of microgravity time given by ground-based facility...|$|E

40|$|The Mn-W-Na/SiO{sub 2 } {{catalyst}} was {{studied by}} running the methane coupling reactions at different methane to oxygen ratios, temperatures and <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> flow rates. For methane to oxygen ratios less than 3, the C{sub 2 } yield {{was almost the}} same; and C{sub 2 } yield began to decrease as the methane to oxygen ratio was further increased. The optimal temperature observed was around 800 {degrees}C, where the C{sub 2 } yield reached a maximum value. Increasing the <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> (helium) flow rate resulted in higher C{sub 2 } selectivity; however, after a certain <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate the C{sub 2 } yield began to decrease due to a decrease in methane conversion {{as a result of}} the reduced contact time. The stability study of the catalyst showed that, after five successive run cycles, the C{sub 2 } yield obtained decreased from 24 % to 19 % at 780 {degrees}C, and methane, oxygen and helium flow rates of 12. 2, 4. 1, and 44. 3 mm/min, respectively. XRD analysis showed that, after the reaction, the XRD peaks of the cristabolite and Na{sub 2 }WO{sub 4 } phases in the catalyst became smaller than those in the fresh catalyst, and that at least one new, unidentified phase was observed. Mn-W-Na/SiO{sub 2 } catalyst was used as the methane oxidative coupling catalyst in a porous membrane reactor and its performance was compared with a packed reactor operated at similar conditions. Although the membrane reactor showed lower methane conversion at the same reaction conditions, it gave higher C{sub 2 } selectivity and C{sub 2 } yield at similar methane conversions...|$|E

We measured the volume of plastic bottles and 16 subjects (including two females), aged 18 - 42 years with each method. For the bottles, the volume measured by hydrostatic weighing was correlated highly (r = 1. 000) with that measured by the new <b>gas</b> <b>dilution</b> method. For the subjects, the body volume determined by the two methods was significantly correlated (r = 0. 998). However, the subject's volume measured by the <b>gas</b> <b>dilution</b> method was significantly larger than that by underwater weighing method. There was significant correlation (r = 0. 806) between GD volume-UW volume and the body mass index (BMI), so that UW volume could be predicted from GD volume and BMI.

50|$|Crushed raw {{oil shale}} is {{fed into the}} top of the retort, and it moves {{downward}} by gravity. When moving downward, oil shale is heated by the rising recycled gases, which cause decomposition of the rock. Recycled gases enter the retort from the bottom. Gases are heated on the lower part of retort by descended spent shale. On their way up, gases move through the combustion zone, where air and <b>dilution</b> <b>gases</b> are injected causing combustion of gases and carbonaceous residue of spent shale (char). The heat from combustion brings the temperature in the retorting zone above of the burning zone to the necessary level for retorting.

It obtains that the DLC film can be synthesize in the inner side of the PET bottle. The barrier property is depended on the plasma parameters. The DLC film deposited only in CCP (capacitively coupled plasma) source shows a micro-cracks, which is detrimental for barrier performance. In contrast, in dual radio frequency plasma source, i. e.

40|$|Laminar burning {{velocities}} of syngas/air premixed flames, {{varying with}} H- 2 /CO ratio (from 5 / 95 to 75 / 25) and N- 2 or CO 2 dilution rate (from 0 % to 60 %), were accurately measured using a Teflon coated Heat Flux burner and OH-PLIF based Bunsen flame method. Experiments {{were carried out}} at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, with fuel/air equivalence ratios ranging from fuel-lean to fuel-rich. Coupled with experimental data, three chemical kinetic mechanisms, namely GRI-Mech 3. 0, USC Mech II and Davis H- 2 -CO mechanism, were validated. All of them can provide good prediction for the laminar burning velocity. The laminar burning velocity variations with H- 2 and <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> contents were systematically investigated. For given <b>dilution</b> <b>gas</b> fraction, the laminar burning velocity reduction rate was enhanced as H- 2 /CO ratio increasing. Effects of the syngas components and equivalence ratio variation on the concentrations of radical H and OH were also studied. It appears {{that there is a}} strong linear correlation between the laminar burning velocity and the maximum concentration of the H radical in the reaction zone for syngas. This characteristic is exclusively different from that in methane air premixed flame. These findings indicated that the high thermal diffusivity of the H radical {{played an important role in}} the laminar burning velocity enhancement and affected the laminar burning velocity reduction rate under dilution condition.

This clarifies that researches on graphene growth {{still needs to}} be improved. Investigation of structural evolution and growth mechanism can provide guidance to produce desired graphene.
