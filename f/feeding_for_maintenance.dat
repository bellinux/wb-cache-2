Although this {{can be achieved by}} selection on an index of multi-trait best linear unbiased prediction of breeding values with optimal economic weights, considering deviations of feed intake from actual needs (RFIRFI) should be of value for further research on biological aspects of FEFE. Here, we present a random regression model that extends the classical definition of RFIRFI by including animal-specific needs in the model. Using this model, we explore the genetic determinism of several FEFE components: use of <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> growth (WGWG), use of <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> backfat deposition (FGFG), use of <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> (MWMW), and unspecific efficiency in the use of feed (RFIRFI). Expected response to alternative selection indexes involving different components is also studied. ResultsBased on goodness-of-fit to the available feed intake (FIFI) data, the model that assumes individual (genetic and permanent) variation in the use of <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance,</b> WGWG and FGFG showed the best performance. Joint individual variation in feed allocation to maintenance, growth and backfat deposition comprised 37...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} efficiency that cattle convert <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and product (body weight gain, milk, and conceptus). Both intake and gain are polygenic traits and to better understand {{factors that contribute to}} variation in feed efficiency more defined phenotypes are needed. Several studies have associated differences in the microbiota of the alimentary tract between obese and non-obese rodents (Turnbaugh et al., 2006), obese and nonobese humans (Ley et al., 2006), and energy metabolism in birds (Torok et al., 2008 and Stanley et al., 2013). These finding suggest that there is a potential relationship between the microbiota of the alimentary tract and feed efficiency in beef cattle.

40|$|Data is herein reported, {{upon the}} effect of the removal of a {{nitrogenous}} fraction present in cod liver oils upon growth, egg production and mortality of poultry. A technique for the removal of a nitrogenous fraction of cod liver oils by acid alcohol extraction, without interfering with the vitamin potency of the oils, was established. Oil processed in this way was fed to a large group of young chickens during the brooding, rearing and egg production periods. This treatment Vias controlled by the feeding of the same oil, unprocessed, to a comparable lot of chicks for the same period. The data obtained indicated a definitely improved growth and a greater degree of uniforcity of growth when this nitrogenous fraction of the oil was removed. The data also indicated that a tendency towards more efficient use of <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance,</b> egg production and body weight gain existed...|$|R
40|$|Feather pecking {{in layers}} is a multi {{factorial}} problem, {{which can be}} caused by environmental, genetic or nutritional factors. From the literature {{it has been shown that}} nutritional factors may positively or negatively affect feather pecking behaviour in laying hens. Nutritional factors seem to reduce feather pecking behaviour in laying hens if these factors increase the time spent on feeding behaviour, by affecting foraging and feed intake. Laying hens may spend more time on these feeding behaviours when they are fed 1) mash diets in stead of crumbles or pellets, 2) low energy diets, 3) high (in-) soluble fibre diets or 4) roughages. However, such feeding strategies may not reduce egg performance of the hens, which can be the case when hens are not able to fully compensate for the dilution. Especially hens at early lay can have problems with consuming sufficient <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and egg production. Therefore, by order of the Product Board Animal Feed and the Product Board Poultry & Eggs an experiment was conducted to measure the effect of energy dilution and feed structure on performance and behaviour of hens at the beginning of the laying period...|$|R
40|$|On a {{life-cycle}} basis, {{beef animals}} {{are able to}} consume large amounts of low-cost, low-quality forages relative to higher-cost concentrates compared with pigs and chickens. However, of the 3, beef is still more expensive to produce on a cost–per–edible pound basis. Accordingly, there is need for genetic programs and management changes that will improve efficiency, sustainability, and profitability of beef production. Options include improving reproductive rate, reducing <b>feed</b> used <b>for</b> <b>maintenance,</b> or both, while not reducing output. A goal for improving efficiency of feed utilization {{is to reduce the}} amount or proportion of <b>feed</b> used <b>for</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Such reduction is a target for genetic improvement, but such a goal does not include defining a single measure of efficiency. A single efficiency measure would likely lead to single-trait selection and not account for any potentially antagonistic effects on other production characteristics. Because we are not able to explain all variation in individual-animal intake from only knowledge of BW maintained and level of production, measuring feed intake is necessary. Therefore, our recommendation is that national cattle evaluation systems analyze feed intake as an economically relevant trait with incorporation of appropriate indicator traits for an EPD <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> intake requirements that could then be used in a multiple-trait setting such as in a selection index. With improvements in technology <b>for</b> measurement of <b>feed</b> intake, individual measures of feed intake should continually be collected to facilitate development of genetic predictors that enhance accuracy of prediction of progeny differences in national cattle evaluations...|$|R

(See 2 ̆ 2 Characterization of Breeds Representing Diverse Biological Types: Reproduction and Maternal Performance of F 1 Cows 2 ̆ 2 elsewhere in this report.) These differences are associated with variation among breeds in reproduction, milk production, and growth rate of progeny. Also, there {{are significant}} differences among F 1 cows in mature weight. Heavier mature weight is associated with more rapid growth rate of progeny, and heavier weights increase output per cow from the production system when cows are sold. However, it also increases the nutrient requirements per cow <b>for</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Thus, {{it is important to}} quantify production inputs as well as outputs in order to characterize genetic variation in efficiency of production.

40|$|Residual {{feed intake}} (RFI) {{is a measure}} of an individual’s {{efficiency}} in utilising <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and production during growth or lactation. It can be defined as the difference between the actual and predicted feed intake of that individual. Efficient animals eat less than predicted for their body weight and level of performance, and inefficient animals eat more. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate possible relationships between RFI and behavioural traits, such as feeding behaviour, social dominance, and activity in young dairy heifers. The intakes and liveweights of 1049 growing dairy heifers (6 - 8 months of age, 195 ± 25. 8 kg liveweight) in five cohorts were measured for 42 - 49 days to ascertain individual RFI. Animals were housed in an outdoor feeding facility comprising 28 pens, each with eight animals and one feeder per pen, and were fed a dried, cubed lucerne diet. An electronic feed monitoring system measured the intake and feeding behaviour of individuals. Intake was moderately to strongly correlated with RFI for individual cohorts (r = 0. 54 - 0. 74; p 0. 05) but ate less (mean ± SED; 6. 97 v 8. 75 ± 0. 10 kg cubes), had fewer meals (6. 3 v 8. 2 ± 0. 61 /d), shorter daily feeding duration (2. 71 v 2. 85 ± 0. 07 h), ate longer meals (35. 6 v 30. 6 ± 1. 54 min/meal), and ate more slowly (45. 4 v 53. 0 ± 1. 36 g cubes/min) than the least efficient animals (all p 0. 05). Feeding behaviour explained only a small proportion of the variation in RFI in dairy heifers. Selecting animals for low RFI (efficient) is unlikely to affect social dominance and activity, although these results should be confirmed in a grazing environment representative of most New Zealand dairy farms...|$|R

This study reports on the variation in relative digestible dry matter intake (rDDMI), defined as the ratio of the digestible dry matter intake of each ewe divided by the group mean and its relationship with growth traits measured in 1279 Merino ewes. DDMI was estimated by faecal marker dilution method. Significant genetic variation was observed in intake with a heritability of 0. 33 ± 0. 09, suggesting scope for effective genetic selection.

40|$|Feed {{intake and}} feed {{efficiency}} are of importance in cattle breeding programmes. A divergent selection experiment on feed intake {{was carried out}} during three generations. Young performance-tested bulls were selected on high or low dry matter roughage intake. The effective phenotypic selection differential in sires was 3. 12 units of phenotypic standard deviation. Dams in first generation were randomly chosen. Data of progenies of 38 selected bulls were recorded in growing, pregnant and lactating heifers <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> intake, daily gain and milk yield. This study is confined {{to the analysis of}} genetic parameters of 417 growing heifers. Data were analyzed in an animal model. Roughage intake had a heritability of 0. 56. Adjustment of roughage intake for differences in metabolic body weight changed the heritability to 0. 19. Feed efficiency was calculated as gross feed efficiency and as residual feed intake (RFI). RFI is <b>feed</b> intake-adjusted <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and daily gain and reflects differences between animals in efficiency of using energy. The heritability estimate was 0. 18 <b>for</b> gross <b>feed</b> efficiency and 0. 22 for RFI. It is concluded that measuring feed intake in addition to body weight could be important <b>for</b> reducing residual <b>feed</b> intake in growing heifers...|$|R
40|$|One {{low cost}} and two premium type sorghum stover {{purchased}} from fodder market in Hyderabad, India were investigated for Organic matter intake (OMI), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and organic matter intake and {{digestible organic matter}} intake (DOMI) with feeding trials on sheep. The average price of low cost stover was IRs 2. 04 per kg dry stover while the premium stover types were priced at IRs 3. 40. Premium stover had consistently more favourable laboratory quality traits (nitrogen, fiber constituents, in vitro digestibility and metabolisable energy content). When fed to sheep unsupplemented, significantly higher digestibility, digestible organic matter intake and nitrogen balances were observed in premium type compared to low cost stover. The same held true when the three stover types were fed supplemented with a flat rate of 150 g/d of concentrate. However, economic assessment suggested that the price premiums of 50 % and more paid for high quality stover were in excess unless their feeding facilitated overall increased intake and milk yield per dairy animal proportionally, decreasing <b>feed</b> expenditure <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirement...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the reason that}} F/G becomes worse as pigs mature, {{it is important to}} {{understand the}} physiology of growth. During the growth cycle of a pig, the pounds of feed required per pound of gain increases, or said anoth-er way, the feed efficiency becomes worse as the pig’s weight increases. Because it is more efficient to build muscle than fat, the efficiency of converting feed to live weight gain is best for young pigs and declines as pigs grow larger and older. Early growing pigs convert dietary feed at less than 2 : 1 F/G while finishing pigs convert feed at over 3 : 1 F/G. The poorer feed efficiency is caused by two major factors. First, the <b>feed</b> required <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> relative to lean growth increases as the pig gets larger. Second, the composition of gain shifts from primarily lean growth to a larger segment of lipid accretion as a pig approaches mature weight. Therefore, the mature frame size of the genet-ics is an important factor in feed efficiency near market weight. Early maturing pigs enter the less efficient fattenin...|$|R
40|$|Divergent {{selection}} for heat loss {{as an indication}} of maintenance energy requirements in mice resulted in a low (ML) and high maintenance line (MH), and an intermediate control line (MC). Improved feed efficiency has been observed in ML mice, which would be economically beneficial in livestock species. However, previous work showed evidence of unfavorable correlated responses to selection in ML mice compared to MH mice. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} model a lifecycle similar to a livestock production system using these lines and determine if these correlated responses diminish the benefit of improved feed efficiency by calculating lifecycle efficiency. Feed intake, reproductive performance, productivity, and body composition were recorded on 63 mating pairs and sampled offspring from each line. Values from mixed-model analysis of these data were used to calculate total lean output of offspring and culled mating pairs and total energy intake of offspring and mating pairs. Lifecycle efficiency was calculated as the sum of offspring and parent output divided by the sum of offspring and parent input. Pairs were cohabitated at 7 wk of age and maintained for up to 1 yr unless culled and offspring were maintained from 21 to 49 d of age. Survival was measured as number of parities achieved by a mating pair. Hypothetical parity distribution of 100 mice at equilibrium was calculated using survival analysis results. High maintenance mice consumed 7 to 20 % more <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> than ML mice. Control mice had greater body weights, total numbers weaned and weaning weights compared to selected animals, while there were no significant differences between MH and ML mice for any traits. Control mice had greater survival rates overall, though ML mice had greatest survival rates up 5 parities, while MH mice had greater survival rates in later parities. Although ML mice were more efficient than MH mice, they were nearly identical to MC mice due to poorer productivity. Differences in body weight and numbers weaned had the greatest effect on lifecycle efficiency, therefore selection <b>for</b> reduced <b>maintenance</b> energy requirement should be utilized as part of selection indices or in terminal crosses. ...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on these}} studies the {{performance}} (growth and efficiency) of hoop pigs {{was affected by}} seasonal variations. During the summer the hoop pigs grew more rapidly and were more efficient in liveweight gain than confinement pigs. However, during the winter, the trend reversed and the hoop pigs grew slower and were less efficient than confinement pigs. Apparently the hoop pigs in the cold environment used more <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> temperature <b>maintenance.</b> When averaged to simulate an entire year, the pigs’ performance was similar. Also the pig performance was more consistent from season to season in confinement. Overall leanness of the hoop pigs was poorer than the confinement pigs as reflected by equivalent or more backfat, smaller loin muscle areas, lower percentage of lean, less lean per pig, the same or slower rate of lean deposition, and the same or poorer efficiency of lean gain.

40|$|Feeding {{and growth}} rates of tagged {{individuals}} and of a captive school of I. illecebrosus, were monitored over a 2 -month period on a live fish diet. The daily <b>feeding</b> rate <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> is estimated at about 1 % of body weight. Average daily feeding rates ranged from 3. 6 to 6. 7 % and average daily growth rates from 1. 0 to 1. 9 % of body weight, both increasing with temperature. Food conversion rates (wet food weight to wet squid weight) ranged from 25 to 36 % and conversion efficiency, after allowing <b>for</b> <b>maintenance,</b> ranged from 35 to 51 %. These feeding and growth rates are higher than those reported for Octopus vulgaris at comparable temperatures. The maintenance requirement was slightly higher for I. illecebrosus but the conversion efficiency was much lower. Growth rates of I. illecebrosus from field data are well below those for captive animals, indicating that the food supply of the natural population becomes increasingly limiting as the season progresses. Estimates of food consumption by the natural population are higher before July than in the remaining months of the year, {{and most of the}} squid biomass results from early season feeding when crustaceans are the principal prey.

40|$|The cow uses about 65 % of {{the feed}} energy {{used in the}} {{production}} of beef cattle.

The growing- finishing animal uses about 35 % of the total <b>feed</b> energy used <b>for</b> beef production. In the growing-finishing animal, maintenance costs may vary from 30 to 100 % of the total feed energy consumed, with the lower proportion being at high intakes and rates of gain. Typically, in feedlot cattle this value ranges from 30 to 40 %, whereas in cattle growing more slowly, such as stocker cattle, maintenance costs represent about 50 to 70 % of the total. As a result, energy expenditures <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> are relevant to all phases of beef production, but are generally of greater importance in the cow herd. Numerous breeds of cattle are currently available to beef cattle producers. Large differences among breeds for important traits such as mature size, growth rate, body composition, and milk production have been well documented. To effect improvements in efficiency, both required feed input and product output need critical examination. Differences among breeds or genotypes have also been observed with regard to energy requirements and/or efficiency of energy utilization <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and weight or energy gain. Some of the research efforts at U. S. Meat Animal Research Center in this regard were summarized in the previous Beef Research Progress Report (Ferrell and Jenkins, 1988).

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that butterflies, {{as is the}} case with many holometabolous insects, rely primarily on nutrients gathered by larval <b>feeding</b> <b>for</b> somatic <b>maintenance</b> and fecundity. These reserves can be supplemented by adult feeding and in some cases by nuptial gifts passed from the males to the females during mating. Recent findings indicate that female butterflies detect and prefer nectar with high levels of amino acids, thus calling new attention to this nutritive source. Polyandrous species can further supplement their larval stores with additional nuptial gifts. This study examined how mating frequency of the polyandrous butterfly Pieris napi affects the female`s preference for nectar amino acids. Females of this species generally detect and prefer nectar mimics containing amino acids. However, nectar amino acid preference is significantly lower in mated females. Furthermore, nectar amino acid preference increases when females are not allowed to remate, whereas the preference of twice-mated females remains constant at a lower level. These results indicate a versatile response of females to nectar amino acids, depending on their nutritional status; they may even switch their source of amino acids between adult feeding and nuptial gifts...|$|R

Residual feed intake (RFI) is a useful measure of feed {{conversion efficiency}}, as it can be used to compare individuals with the same or differing levels of production during the period of measurement. If genetic variation exists in RFI among dairy cattle, selection for lower RFI could improve profitability. In this experiment, RFI was defined as the difference between an animal 2 ̆ 7 s actual feed intake and its expected feed intake, which was determined by regression of dry matter (DM) intake against mean body weight (BW) and growth rate. Nine hundred and three Holstein-Friesian heifer calves, aged between 5 and 7 mo, were measured for RFI in 3 cohorts of approximately 300 animals. Calves were housed under feedlot style conditions in groups of 15 to 20 for 85 to 95 d and had ad libitum access to a cubed alfalfa hay. Intakes of individual animals were recorded via an electronic feed recording system and BW gain was determined by weighing animals once or twice weekly, over a period of 60 to 70 d.

This is particularly true {{in light of the}} wide diversity of environmental conditions encountered by beef producers in the U. S. This approach requires considerable knowledge about genetic diversity among breeds in components of performance and furthermore how those components interact to influence life-cycle efficiency in the production setting. It was largely this identified need, coupled with the importation of a number of new breeds from continental Europe, that gave impetus for the establishment of the Germplasm Evaluation (GPE) Program. In Cycles I and II of the GPE program, increases in cow output associated with higher breed potential for growth rate and milk production were largely offset by equivalent or greater increases in <b>feed</b> requirements <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and lactation. Additionally, in Cycle III, output of calf weaned per cow in the breeding herd was high for Bos indicus x Bos taurus crosses relative to Bos taurus crosses.

40|$|Feed {{efficiency}} is an elusive concept with multiple definitions. We have made tremendous progress in gross feed efficiency by selecting for increased milk yield. Yield {{expressed as a}} multiple of maintenance is an important determinant of gross efficiency below 5 x maintenance levels of production, and {{can be achieved by}} increasing yield with constant body size and maintenance requirement, or decreasing body size and maintenance requirement while maintaining production.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between nutrition {{and reproduction is}} a topic of increasing importance. Many research reports have clearly demonstrated that energy, protein and minerals intake {{are the most important}} nutritional factors affecting reproduction and therefore milk production in dairy farms. This is particularly evident on smallholder farms in the tropics where feed is often inadequate. On these farms, voluntary feed intake in relation to the <b>feed</b> required <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> is the most important factor determining the animal’s body condition. Many of the dairy animals on smallholder farms cannot build sufficient body reserves (particularly energy and protein) due to lack of adequate feed. As a direct consequence of feed inadequacy, dairy stock on most smallholder resource-poor farms are often in poor body condition (emaciated). Conception rate and calving intervals {{have been shown to be}} highly correlated, to by weight and body condition. The study revealed that animals with low body weights showed low conception rate and long calving interval. Energy and protein have shown to maintain essential levels of blood cholesterol and improve pregnancy from 42 to 72 % respectively. Correlation of reproductive hormone cycle, calf and lamb birth rates, weaning rates, lactation length and yield with plane of nutrition, have been adequately illustrated. This is evidenced by the current high incidences of dairy cow infertility on smallholder farms in Kenya. Based on the literature reviewed, the current study concluded that poor nutrition is a major contributor to the current poo...|$|R

40|$|Pigs require energy <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and {{productive}} purposes, and an accurate amount of available energy in feeds {{should be provided}} according to their energy requirement. Available energy in <b>feeds</b> <b>for</b> pigs has been characterized as DE, ME, or NE by considering sequential energy losses during digestion and metabolism from GE in feeds. Among these energy values, the NE system has been recognized as providing energy values of ingredients and diets that most closely describes the available energy to animals because it takes the heat increment from digestive utilization and metabolism of feeds into account. However, NE values for diets and individual ingredients are moving targets, and therefore, none of the NE systems are able to accurately predict truly available energy in feeds. The DE or ME values <b>for</b> <b>feeds</b> are important <b>for</b> predicting NE values, but depend on the growth stage of pigs (i. e., BW) due to the different abilities of nutrient digestion, especially for dietary fiber. The NE values are also influenced by both environment that affects NE requirement <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> (NEm) and the growth stage of pigs that differs in nutrient utilization (i. e., protein vs. lipid synthesis) in the body.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Aspects {{concerning}} the bionomics of the parasitic honey bee brood mite, Varroa jacobsoni Oudemans were investigated. Mite mortality is great {{during the winter}} season when the host colony is not rearing brood, appearing to be independent of the mortality of its host. In winter period, no significant association {{between the number of}} dead mites and the number of dead adult workers was observed. It appears that the mites are dying by factors other than the host death. Drifting drones facilitate the horizontal transmission of Varroa jacobsoni mites between colonies, especially in modern beekeeping in which managed colonies are kept similarly hived and close together. A great tendency of drones to drift among colonies was observed. A significant correlation was found in the rate of mites per drones and the number of drones in the colonies. It was concluded that the transmission of Varroa jacobsoni among colonies via drifting drones is a common mechanism for the transmission of mites. The relationship between mite load {{and the size of the}} honey bee brood host was investigated. The data showed significant statistical differences between the infestation rate of the mite that is, number of female mites per infested pupae and the size of the worker brood nest of its host. With a high number of worker cells in the colony, the mite load is lowered. Feeding activities of V. jacobsoni causes a great impact on A. mellifera colony survival not only through physical damage caused by this mite but also through transmission of various entomopathogenic agents responsible for the outbreak of secondary diseases in the colony. I concluded that mites fed on adult bees during summer time. It appears that the frequency of mite feeding on adult bees at this time is low, suggesting that probably the mite <b>feeds</b> only <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and survival rather than for reproduction...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between nutrition {{and reproduction is}} a topic of increasing importance. Many research reports have clearly demonstrated that energy, protein and minerals intake {{are the most important}} nutritional factors affecting reproduction and therefore milk production in dairy farms. This is particularly evident on smallholder farms in the tropics where feed is often inadequate. On these farms, voluntary feed intake in relation to the <b>feed</b> required <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> is the most important factor determining the animal`s body condition. Many of the dairy animals on smallholder farms cannot build sufficient body reserves (particularly energy and protein) due to lack of adequate feed. As a direct consequence of feed inadequacy, dairy stock on most smallholder resource-poor farms are often in poor body condition (emaciated). Conception rate and calving intervals {{have been shown to be}} highly correlated, to by weight and body condition. The study revealed that animals with low body weights showed low conception rate and long calving interval. Energy and protein have shown to maintain essential levels of blood cholesterol and improve pregnancy from 42 to 72 % respectively. Correlation of reproductive hormone cycle, calf and lamb birth rates, weaning rates, lactation length and yield with plane of nutrition, have been adequately illustrated. This is evidenced by the current high incidences of dairy cow infertility on smallholder farms in Kenya. Based on the literature reviewed, the current study concluded that poor nutrition is a major contributor to the current poor reproductive performance of dairy cows on smallholder farms. Poor nutrition is also largely incriminated for predisposing animals to diseases leading to high mortality and morbidity rates on these farms. It is therefore perceived that improvement of ruminant livestock diets on smallholder farms will greatly improve reproductive performance and therefore herd productivity on smallholder farms. In the long run, this will also impact positively on the economic status of the household...|$|R

40|$|A {{decrease}} in land availability and {{inventory of the}} cow herd has created {{a concern for the}} sustainability of beef cattle production. Intensifying production by feeding cows in a controlled environment (i. e. drylot) that allows for dietary manipulation could improve system efficiency, although logistical issues of feed delivery need to be solved. Subsequent trials were designed as 2 ? 2 factorials to determine if limit-feeding an ionophore diet to cows during mid-gestation could reduce maintenance energy requirements. Both projects were designed to feed one diet at either 120 % (H) or 80 % (L) of NRC requirements with either 0 or 200 mg?hd- 1 ?d- 1 of monensin. Forty cows were fed for 56 d to determine performance, while sixteen ruminally cannulated steers were used for intake and digestion. To aid in feed delivery, bulk density and void space were calculated <b>for</b> common <b>feed</b> ingredients to determine mix-ability and maximum payloads. Steers fed L had greater (P 0. 15). Passage rate was slower for L than H (P < 0. 01) and 200 than 0 (P < 0. 03). Acetate:propionate was lower in 200 than 0 (P < 0. 01) while rumen pH was increased (P < 0. 05). Cows gained more BW when fed at H versus L (P < 0. 01) with no effect of monensin (P = 0. 97). Retained energy per EBW 0. 75 was greater for H than L (P < 0. 01) although heat production was also greater (P < 0. 01). Monensin had no effect on either RE (P = 0. 94) or HE (P = 0. 53). Monensin did not alter <b>feed</b> required <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> or fasting heat production. However, FHP was estimated to be 62. 85 kcal?EBW- 0. 75 ?d- 1, a decrease of 26. 1 % from NRC requirements. Roughages had lower (P < 0. 01) bulk density and greater void space (P < 0. 01) than concentrates. Accurate predictions of maximum payload of multiple ingredients were able to be made from these calculations. Overall, it appears limit-feeding diets can increase production efficiency of cow-calf systems. Use of bulk density and void space data may allow optimization of mixing and reduce delivery costs of high-roughage diets to large numbers of cattle in confinement systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} issues {{concerning}} the sustainability of beef production systems, including alternative land use decisions and liquidation in cow inventory, have magnified the need to enhance system efficiency. One approach to increasing production efficiency is through the intensification of cow-calf systems. In intensified systems cows will be housed in a controlled environment (i. e. drylot) {{for at least a}} portion of their reproductive cycle, subsequently offering the opportunity to develop nutritional manipulation strategies to optimize cow efficiency. An experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of dietary energy density and intake on maintenance energy requirements in beef cows. In a 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement, thirty-two crossbred cows were fed either a high- (H, 2. 54 Mcal ME/kg) or a low-energy (L, 1. 96 Mcal ME/kg) diet at one of two levels of intake (80; 80 % NRC NE requirements, 120; 120 % NRC NE requirements). Several methods using empirical equations were used to estimate body energy on d 0 and 56 as a proxy for RE. HE was calculated as the difference between ME and RE. Body weight gain tended to be greater (P = 0. 08) in H than L, but was not different (P = 0. 12) between 120 than 80. Retained energy tended to be greater (P ? 0. 10) in H than L and greater (P ? 0. 08) in 120 than 80. Heat energy per EBW^ 0. 75 was greater (P 0. 22) or level of intake (P > 0. 56). <b>Feed</b> requirement <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> was calculated to be 92. 54 and 168. 06 kcal ME/EBW^ 0. 75 for H and L, respectively. Fasting heat production was estimated to be 54. 60 and 74. 78 kcal/EBW^ 0. 75 for H and L, respectively. Overall, increasing dietary energy density resulted in a decrease in maintenance requirements of approximately 28 % and intake restriction decreased HE by approximately 28 %, with no interaction, suggesting additive effects. Limit feeding high-energy diets to beef cows has the potential to increase the efficiency of production and land use in U. S. cow-calf systems...|$|R
40|$|The use of foggage {{as winter}} <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> animal <b>maintenance</b> is {{unlikely}} to totally replace hay and/or silage, but should {{be used as an}} alternative for the early winter. The most important objective in producing foggage is to feed animals to at least maintain body weight through the winter season. As foggage is generally not a high quality feed, it usually can not be used for producing animals without supplementation. Using foggage can also mininise expensive inputs, such as labour and machinery. This is the single most outstanding advantage of using pasture foggage over hay, haylage, crop residues or silage. Although pastures also have establishment and fertilizer costs, these are less than costs associated with intensive annual crops. Many pastures are also perennial, which means less establishment costs. This emphasises the importance for less intensive farming systems. Depending on what the objectives of the farmer are, he can manage foggage to produce a high yield with a lower quality or vice versa. Thus it is critical to maintain a balance between yield and quality. Foggage quality was inversely related to the growing season after the pasture was closed-up and thus the quality will be lower with earlier closing-up time. Fertilisation, especially with nitrogen, will increase the nutritive value of the product (6 % - 12 %CP). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which pasture provides the best foggage in different scenarios. The conclusion is, therefore, that a farmer must first decide on his management plan and where his foggage will fit in. Then it is recommended to choose the species (or accession) that is best adapted to his specific area of farming. Silk sorghum and Coastcross II had the best yields recorded. Smutsfinger grass was very palatable, had high digestibility and would, therefore, be recommended for quality in the higher rainfall eastern parts of the country. Because of their drought resistance, Molopo and Kleingrass will be recommended for the warmer areas with less rainfall and Molopo especially for small farmers who lack overall grazing management skills or infrastructure.
