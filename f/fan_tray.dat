50|$|The 3064 has {{a single}} <b>fan</b> <b>tray,</b> two {{replaceable}} power-supplies on board and two separate out of band management interfaces. To connect the 3064 {{to the rest of}} the network the use of proprietary EtherChannel or Link aggregation using industry-standard LACP or IEEE 802.3ad is supported with up to 32 port-channels with each up to 16 physical interfaces.|$|E
40|$|The cooling {{performance}} {{test of the}} 52 U rack, housing SCT LV&HV power supplies for 192 detector modules, being located in USA 15 cavern, has been curried out. The rack was equipped with two air-water heat exchangers, air turbine, four vertical <b>fan</b> <b>tray</b> units under crates and horizontal fans in four Artesyn AC/DC power supply units. The resistive dummy loads for 192 power supply channels {{have been placed in}} four crates and housed in the adjacent rack...|$|E

50|$|However, some rack {{equipment}} {{has been}} designed to make fan replacement easy, using quick-change <b>fan</b> <b>trays</b> that can be accessed without removing the cabling or the device from the rack, and in some cases without turning off the device so that operation is uninterrupted during replacement.|$|R
50|$|The VSP 8284XSQ is a fixed, compact {{form-factor}} Ethernet Switch {{that operates}} the Virtual Services Platform Operating System (VOSS), and provides eighty 1/10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ ports and four 40 Gigabit Ethernet QSFP+ ports. The VSP 8284XSQ supports high-availability AC power (1+1), field-replaceable <b>fan</b> <b>trays,</b> and front-to-back airflow.|$|R
40|$|NASTRAN was principally used {{to perform}} failure {{analysis}} and redesign process equipment. It was also {{employed in the}} evaluation of vendor designs and proposed design modifications to existing process equipment. Stress analysis of forced draft <b>fans,</b> distillation <b>trays,</b> metal stacks, jacketed pipes, heat exchangers, large centrifugal fans, and agitator support structures are described...|$|R
5000|$|The sporty Pacer sedan was {{available}} again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered {{with the one}} power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 {{different versions of the}} new 245 Hemi-6 engine, though Chrysler Australia didn't publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced [...] Option E31 produced [...] and included a two-barrel carburettor, higher-performance camshaft, smaller <b>fan,</b> and windage <b>tray.</b> Option E34 produced [...] and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller <b>fan,</b> windage <b>tray,</b> premium engine bearings, shot-peened crankshaft and connecting rods, and high-capacity oil pump. Option E35 included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty engine bearings, a dual-plate clutch, torque-limiting engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010 Avaya {{introduced}} its Virtual Enterprise Network Architecture (VENA) and in May 2011 this Switch, featuring 24 ports of fixed 10 Gigabit Ethernet was released {{as part of}} the VENA strategy. The VSP 7000 is future-ready for 40GbE and 100GbE by virtue of the Media Dependent Adapter (MDA) slot on the front panel, enabling in-service deployment of high-speed connections. The Switch is also future-ready for storage area networking. The company gained the foundational technology for the VENA strategy through its $915 million acquisition of Nortel Enterprise Solutions business unit in December 2009. The Switch supports 24 fixed ports 1 or 10 Gigabit via SFP+ sockets, either front-to-back or back-to-front cooling, field replaceable <b>fan</b> <b>trays,</b> and field replaceable redundant AC or DC power supplies. The Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology allows the MDA to support additional 10GbE ports (8-port SFP+ and 10GBASE-T currently available, increasing port density to 32 ports), with future 40GbE (2-port), and 100GbE (1-port) planned. The VSP 7000 Series also futures integrated rear-mounted 'Fabric Interconnect' interfaces (four) that delivers - per Switch - 640Gbit/s aggregate (320Gbit/s full-duplex) of bandwidth for Switch-to-Switch connectivity; Avaya market this technology as 'Distributed Top-of-Rack' (DToR). [...] Recently added to the system is a Virtual Provisioning Service (VPS) that helps managers track and manage, provision and troubleshoot their virtual machine environments. The VPS technology works with VMwareâ€™s VCenter (part of vSphere) to automate configuration changes. In September 2011 the system was reported as installed in the first US-based LEAP Center.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to other}} self-taught artists, Sister Morgan used simple forms {{to depict the}} human figure. Her works are {{characterized}} by their lack {{of the use of}} formal techniques such as perspective and definition of light and shadow, giving them a flat, two dimensional quality. She painted and drew using acrylics, tempera, ballpoint pen, watercolors, crayon, colored and lead pencils and felt tip markers. Using inexpensive materials she had at hand, Sister Morgan painted on paper, toilet rolls, plastic pitchers, paper megaphones, scrap wood, lampshades, paper <b>fans</b> and styrofoam <b>trays.</b> The fact that she was self-taught, coupled with her choice of materials as well as her style and subject matter have led her to be characterized as a naive, folk, visionary, vernacular and outsider artist.|$|R
