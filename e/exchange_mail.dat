5000|$|Many UUCP hosts, {{particularly}} those at universities, were also {{connected to the}} Internet in its early years, and e-mail gateways between Internet SMTP-based mail and UUCP mail were developed.

50|$|Kenna {{is a small}} unincorporated {{community}} in Roosevelt County, New Mexico, United States. It is located on U.S. Highway 70, 30 mi southwest of Portales. The settlement was originally known as Urton, probably named for two brothers {{who came to the}} region from the state of Missouri in 1884. A contractor by the name of Kenna camped in Urton during the construction of a roadbed for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Kenna's camp served as a stopping place for stagecoachs to <b>exchange</b> <b>mail</b> as well as passengers.|$|E

50|$|The basic EAI {{concepts}} involve <b>exchanging</b> <b>mail</b> in UTF-8. Though {{the original}} proposal included a downgrading mechanism for legacy systems, this {{has now been}} dropped.

The mail server is also responsible for any mapping mechanism between the IMA form and any ASCII alias.|$|R
50|$|Several networks, such as BITNET, CSNET, UUCP, existed {{that were}} in {{widespread}} use among computer professionals and academic users, but were not interoperable directly with the Internet and <b>exchanged</b> <b>mail</b> with the Internet via special email gateways.

50|$|The {{revolt of}} Muhammad Ahmad {{that began in}} 1881 had cut Equatoria off {{from the outside world}} by 1883, and the {{following}} year, Karam Allah marched south to capture Equatoria and Emin. In 1885, Emin and most of his forces withdrew further south, to Wadelai near Lake Albert. Cut off from communications to the north, he was still able to <b>exchange</b> <b>mail</b> with Zanzibar through Buganda. Determined to remain in Equatoria, his communiques, carried by his friend Wilhelm Junker, aroused considerable sentiment in Europe in 1886, particularly acute after the death of Gordon the previous year.|$|E
5000|$|For Windows NT 5.0 (released as Windows 2000) however, Microsoft {{included}} Active Directory, an LDAP {{directory service}} {{based on the}} directory from its <b>Exchange</b> <b>mail</b> server. Active Directory was as robust as and, in several key ways, superior to VINES. While VINES was limited to a three-part name, user.company.org, like Novell's NDS structure, Active Directory was not bound by such a naming convention. Active Directory had developed an additional capability that both NDS and VINES lacked, its [...] "forest and trees" [...] organizational model. The combination of better architecture and a marketing company the size of Microsoft doomed StreetTalk, VINES as an OS, and finally Banyan itself.|$|E
50|$|A Seapost was a mail {{compartment}} aboard an ocean-going vessel in which international <b>exchange</b> <b>mail</b> was distributed. The first USA service {{of this type}} was the U.S.-German Seapost, which began operating in 1891 on the S.S. Havel North German Lloyd Line. This service rapidly expanded with routes to Great Britain, Central America, South America, and Asia. The Seapost service still employed fifty-five clerks in early 1941. The last route of this type (to South America) was terminated October 19, 1941, due to unsafe wartime conditions on the Atlantic Ocean. The few remaining Seapost clerks transferred to other branches of the Railway Mail Service (RMS). Seapost operations for the Post Office Department were supervised from a New York City, New York, office.|$|E
50|$|In 1852, a Postal Treaty {{was signed}} between Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. One {{practical}} {{effect of this}} Treaty {{was that in the}} free port on Tigre Island, near Amapala (Honduras), a postal employee <b>exchanged</b> <b>mail</b> between the three countries. Guatemala and El Salvador signed a further treaty in 1865 with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, providing for reciprocal <b>exchange</b> of <b>mail</b> andparcels, free postage on official and diplomatic mail, and other procedural matters. It is believed that El Salvador, as the other Central American countries, retained the 2 real rate for domestic and inter-Central American postage for letters of less than one-half ounce until the issuance of its adhesive stamps. It {{is important to note that}} mail to and from any Central American destination could be marked prepaid or collect, at the option of the sender.|$|R

50|$|In 1989, Robert Elz {{established}} the first permanent Internet feed to Australia, at the University of Melbourne. Until this time, researchers within Australia had {{limited access to}} the ARPAnet, due to the high expense of providing communications between Australia and the United States. The national network infrastructure generally consisted of groups of hosts connected throughout the country <b>exchanging</b> <b>mail</b> and files on a periodic schedule using the SUN3 software and protocols, with several international dial-up links around the country exchanging this information where required.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{interested}} in selling {{the system to}} other customers, GEIS developed both DOS and eventually Windows based versions of the client software and sold the system as [...] "DealerTalk" [...] starting in 1986, aiming at the Apple model of manufacturers using the system to communicate with their dealers. All the systems, including the AppleLink community, were united behind the scenes as part of GEIS' worldwide Quik-Comm E-mail service and could <b>exchange</b> <b>mail</b> {{with each other and}} all GEIS mail customers, using addresses like MICHAEL@APPLELINK or JOHNDOE@GEIS. This was later expanded to include Internet mail addresses. Eventually, the GEIS products were renamed BusinessTalk and after a complete system rewrite and creation of their own Macintosh client program (never incorporated into AppleLink), again renamed BusinessTalk System 2000 in 1992. During this time the system, with the Windows client, also became the foundation for Microsoft's first on-line service for developers, the Microsoft Partner Network (MSPN).|$|E
5000|$|The third Fort Carlton (1810-1885) {{was built}} on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan at the Great Crossing Place, a ford of that river. John Peter Pruden was master (1814-1815), master and trader (1815-1820) and chief trader (1821 - 1837) except for a brief {{furlough}} to London in 1824-1825. The area was prairie and not beaver country, but there were plentiful woods nearby and even a supply of limestone. The NWC had its Fort La Montée inside the same stockade as Fort Carlton. In 1816 the Nor'Westers moved out and established a second Fort La Montée on the north bank 3 miles upstream. With the union in 1821 La Montée was abandoned and whatever could be salvaged was rafted down to Fort Carlton. In 1824 a group of Plains Indians tried to attack the fort but were driven off. By 1835 the buildings were in disrepair and a new hexagonal fort was built 200 yards to the west. This fell into disrepair and a new fort was built a few yards east of the first fort in 1855-58. About this time it was a depot for the winter express mail. Men coming from the upper Saskatchewan and Athabasca would meet and <b>exchange</b> <b>mail</b> with men coming from the Red River country south of Lake Winnipeg. There was a smallpox epidemic in 1869. Steamboats arrived on the Saskatchewan in 1874.|$|E
40|$|We {{show how}} to build and execute models of {{concurrent}} and distributed production systems {{using some of the}} Unix tools for text processing (awk), process management (bash) and information <b>exchange</b> (<b>mail).</b> We use plain text files to represent the state of the production cell, implement production operations as text-transformations, compose such operations into one or several processes for their sequential or concurrent execution and allow remote processes (located in different cells) {{to communicate with each other}} by sending emails. The models are highly configurable, able to represent assembly lines, flexible manufacturing systems, even virtual organisations.
