40|$|Immunocontraceptive {{vaccines}} {{have shown}} some promise for fertility control of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in {{urban and suburban}} habitats where traditional methods of population control may not be applicable. Currently, the only contraceptive vaccine approved by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in white-tailed deer is GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine, but it is registered for use via hand-injection only. It {{has been suggested that}} remote-delivery of immunocontraceptives would be more cost-effective than hand-injection, but there is the potential for incomplete injection from a syringe-dart. Therefore, the purpose of our research was to: (1) conduct a <b>dart</b> <b>configuration</b> assessment trial to determine the ideal syringe-dart configuration for remote-delivery of GonaCon to white-tailed deer and (2) use the determined syringe-dart configuration in a subsequent trial to evaluate the vaccine efficacy when administered to female white-tailed deer via hand-injection versus syringe-dart. We saw comparable results with regard to vaccine dispersal during the <b>dart</b> <b>configuration</b> assessment and the efficacy trial; syringedart injected deer presented vaccine deposits and reaction sites both subcutaneously and intramuscularly, whereas, hand-injected deer presented vaccine deposits and reaction sites only intramuscularly. One year after administration, 4 of 5 deer treated with syringe-darts were pregnant, compared to 3 of 6 deer that received hand-injections. Anti-GnRH titers were negatively related to pregnancy status. We did not observe a high level of vaccine efficacy with the syringe-dart delivery method we used. Therefore, we recommend further research of syringe-dart delivery of GonaCon with a larger sample size where the vaccine is deployed in a single bolus similar to a hand-injected presentation...|$|E
40|$|The 2011 Decadal Survey for {{planetary}} science {{released by}} the National Research Council of the National Academies identified Comet Surface Sample Return (CSSR) as one of five high priority potential New Frontiers-class missions in the next decade. The main objectives of the research described in this publication are: develop a concept for an end-to-end system for collecting and storing a comet sample {{to be returned to}} Earth; design, fabricate and test a prototype Dynamic Acquisition and Retrieval Tool (DART) capable of collecting 500 cc sample in a canister and eject the canister with a predetermined speed; identify a set of simulants with physical properties at room temperature that suitably match the physical properties of the comet surface as it would be sampled. We propose the use of a dart that would be launched from the spacecraft to impact and penetrate the comet surface. After collecting the sample, the sample canister would be ejected at a speed greater than the comet's escape velocity and captured by the spacecraft, packaged into a return capsule and returned to Earth. The dart would be composed of an inner tube or sample canister, an outer tube, a decelerator, a means of capturing and retaining the sample, and a mechanism to eject the canister with the sample for later rendezvous with the spacecraft. One of the significant unknowns is the physical properties of the comet surface. Based on new findings from the recent Deep Impact comet encounter mission, we have limited our search of solutions for sampling materials to materials with 10 to 100 kPa shear strength in loose or consolidated form. As the possible range of values for the comet surface temperature is also significantly different than room temperature and testing at conditions other than the room temperature can become resource intensive, we sought sample simulants with physical properties at room temperature similar to the expected physical properties of the comet surface material. The chosen <b>DART</b> <b>configuration,</b> the efforts to identify a test simulant and the properties of these simulants, and the results of the preliminary testing will be described in this paper...|$|E
