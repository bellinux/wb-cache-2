40|$|Security in {{building}} automation systems (BAS) recently became a topic in the security community. BAS form a part of enterprise networks and can be utilized {{to gain access to}} a company network or to violate a security policy. Up to now, the threat of covert channels in BAS protocols was not discovered. While a first available solution can limit ``high level'' covert channels in BAS, there is no solution available to prevent covert channels on the lower level (i. e., in BAS protocols). In this paper, we present network covert storage and network covert timing channels in the network and application layer of the BACnet protocol stack to show that protocol-level covert channels in BAS are feasible. Additionally, we introduce the first means enabling a BAS to become multi-level secure on the network and application layer to prevent covert channels. We built a prototype based on the BACnet <b>firewall</b> <b>router</b> (BFR) to implement multi-level security in BACnet environments...|$|E

40|$|The modern {{commercial}} {{systems and}} software {{industry in the}} United States {{have grown up in}} a snake-oil salesman 2 ̆ 7 s paradise. The largest sector of this industry by far is composed of standard commercial systems that are marketed to provide specified functionality (e. g. Internet web server, <b>firewall,</b> <b>router,</b> etc.) Such products are generally provided with a blanket disclaimer stating that the purchaser must evaluate the suitability of the product for use, and that the user assumes all liability for product behavior. In general, users cannot evaluate and cannot be expected to evaluate the security claims of a product. The ability to analyze security claims is important because a consumer may place unwarranted trust in the security abilities of a web server (or other computer device) to perform its stated purpose, thereby putting his own organization at risk, as well as third parties (consumers, business partners, etc.) All but the largest and most capable organizations lack the resources or expertise to evaluate the security claims of a product. More importantly, no reasonable and knowledgeable person would expect {{them to be able to}} do so. The normal legal presumptions of approximate equality of bargaining power and comparable sophistication in evaluating benefits and risks are grievously unjust in the context of software security. In these transactions, it is far wiser to view the general purchaser, even if that purchaser is a sizable corporation, as an ignorant consumer. Hence, often purchasers accept what appear to be either implied merchantability claims of the vendor or claims of salespersons 2 ̆ 7 made outside of the context of a written document. These claims frequently have little, if any, basis in fact. These standard commercial systems form the bulk of the critical infrastructure of existing Internet functionality and e-commerce systems. Often, these systems are not trustworthy, yet the use of these systems by misinformed purchasers created massive vulnerability for both purchasers and third parties (including a substantial fraction of both U. S. and international citizens). The frequent disclosure of individual credit card information from supposedly secure commercial systems illustrates an aspect of this vulnerability and raises serious questions concerning the merchantability of these systems. While it is impossible to avoid all risks, they can be reduced to a very small fraction of their current level. Vendors have willfully taken approaches and used processes that do not allow assurance of appropriate security properties, while simultaneously and recklessly misrepresenting the security properties of their products to their customers...|$|E

Indeed, the <b>firewalls</b> and <b>routers</b> can be considered bastion hosts. Due to their exposure, {{a great deal of}} effort is made to minimize the chances of penetration.

50|$|A network {{virtualization}} platform decouples {{the hardware}} plane from the software plane {{such that the}} host hardware plane can be administratively programmed to assign its resources to the software plane.

The key benefit to such technology is doing all of this while maintaining the network performance typically seen with that of standalone network appliances as well as enabling the ability to administratively or dynamically program resources at will.|$|R
50|$|Hole {{punching}} is {{a technique}} in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind <b>firewalls</b> or behind <b>routers</b> that use network address translation (NAT). To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; {{as a result of}} the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive <b>firewalls</b> or <b>routers</b> accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.|$|R

Instead of just capturing traffic and replaying the trace, we identify a set of packet trace manipulation operations that enable us to generate a trace bottom-up:our trace primitives can be traces from different environments or artificially generated ones; our basic operations include merging oftwotraces,movingaflowacrosstime,duplicatingaflow, and stretching a flow’s time-scale. After discussing the potential as well as the dangers of each operation with respect to analysis at different protocol layers, we present a framework within which these operations can be realized and show an example configuration for our prototype...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — an {{infinitely}} expanding {{number of}} network appliances are utilising packet classifiers to fulfil Quality of Service, security, and traffic engineering tasks. Packet classification {{is an important}} role of <b>firewalls</b> and <b>routers.</b> Internet <b>firewalls,</b> <b>routers</b> an d service providers perform different operations at different flows. All the packets have to be classified methodically for emerging broadband internet services, and applications such as Internet TV/Radio, gaming, Video on Demand (VoD) and e-businesses, which are in perpetual demand for {{a higher degree of}} transmission bandwidth, complex security, and specific Quality of Service (QoS). This paper presents a comparative evaluation packet classification of algorithms, HiCut, based on a decision tree structure, and the Recursive Dimensional Cutting (DimCut). The comparison has been conducted on operations based on similar principles and design choices. Performances measurements have been obtained by placing the implemented classifiers in the same test conditions scenario. In particular, the comparison aims at achieving a good arrangement between performance, memory usage and flexibility. The Recursive Dimensional Cutting (DimCut) is the extension of HiCut algorithm with new heuristics ideas, implementing techniques and parallel programming features which classify packets while retaining HiCut’s basic framework. After testing the DimCut algorithm, for classifying packets based on five header fields, it is observed that the algorithm can classify packets rapidly. The DimCut algorithm has two separated levels, pre-processing level (tree construction and making index table) and search level...|$|R

40|$|Queuing network {{models of}} modern {{computing}} systems must consider {{a large number}} of components (e. g., Web servers, DB servers, application servers, <b>firewall,</b> <b>routers,</b> networks) and hundreds of customers with very different resource requirements. The complexity of such models makes the application of exact solution techniques prohibitively expensive, motivating research on approximate methods. This paper proposes an interpolation-matching framework that allows a unified view of approximate solution techniques for closed product-form queuing networks. Depending upon the interpolating functional form and the matching populations selected, a large versatile family of new approximations can be generated. It is shown that all the known approximation strategies, including Linearizer, are instances of the interpolation-matching framework. Furthermore, a new approximation technique, based on a third-order polynomial, is obtained using the interpolation-matching framework. The new technique is shown to be more accurate than other known methods...|$|R
40|$|Fast string {{search and}} {{matching}} {{is critical for}} many security tasks in particular if these have gate functionality for instance as found in access control applications, <b>firewalls,</b> <b>routers,</b> and load balancers. The fast matching of strings is essential to impose and enforce access control policies without creating bottlenecks. Firewalls protect networks by monitoring the traffic crossing the network perimeter. The number of packet matching rules firewalls can effectively handle {{is limited by the}} matching time and space complexity of the algorithms employed. A new approach implements matching independent of the number of rules and linear in the length of the rule to be matched. A data structure used in this approach is referred to as a Bipartite Concatenated Representation (BCR). The space complexity of the BCR within this application scenario scales as O(N log 2 N) where N is the number of rules...|$|R
