5|$|The Lady Vols {{were awarded}} the No. 1 {{seed in the}} Mideast Regional where their {{opponent}} was, oddly enough, also undefeated. The 28–0 Lady Flames of Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed.

5|$|Jeremy travels back to {{the ruins}} from the {{beginning}} of the game, only to find that the army of Rome <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.|$|E

Under coach Jim Mora and Hundley, UCLA <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> USC by a combined score of 111–62 over the last three years. The Bruins had a season-high six sacks, and Kessler was limited to 22 of 34 passing for 214 yards.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia {{earned the}} eighth {{seed in the}} 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the 1st-seeded Chicago Bulls. Philadelphia {{improved}} from their struggles {{in the second half}} of the regular season, beating Chicago 4–2 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4–3. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, however, given credit for winning the regular-season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.|$|E
25|$|UVa {{entered this}} game with an 0-29 record against Clemson. The win was Virginia's first-ever victory over an {{opponent}} {{ranked in the}} top ten. Both goalposts came down when the fans stormed the field; the first actually fell with 48seconds still on the clock. The win proved to be something of a watershed in UVA football history in that it {{set the stage for the}} 1990 squad to begin the season 70, rising to #1 in the polls for the first time. In addition, in contrast to Virginia's historical futility against Clemson prior to the 1990 game, as of 2013 UVA <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> Clemson eight times (and tied once) since that 1990 win, although since 2004 the schools no longer play every year due to the Atlantic Coast Conference's expansion.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent on July 1, 2014, {{and signed a}} three-year, $18 million contract to become the starting goaltender with the Vancouver Canucks.

On January 30, 2015, after beating his former team, the Buffalo Sabres, 5–2, Miller <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> every team in the NHL at least once. However, on February 22, Miller was injured after Jannik Hansen crashed into him ending his night as he and Eddie Lack combine a shutout over the New York Islanders. He would miss the next 21 games. After 22 games of not being on ice, Miller returned to start the last game {{of the regular season}} as the Canucks beat the Edmonton Oilers, 6–5.|$|E
25|$|As of the 2014–2015 season, the men's {{basketball}} team has over 1,898 wins, {{one of only}} 8 schools with more wins, and have appeared in 28 NCAA tournaments. Former player Austin Carr holds the record for most points scored in a single game of the tournament with 61. Although the team has never won the NCAA Tournament, they were named by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions twice. The team has orchestrated a number of upsets of number one ranked teams, the most notable of which was ending UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. The team <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> an additional eight number-one teams, and those nine wins rank second, to UCLA's 10, all-time in wins against the top team. The team plays in newly renovated Purcell Pavilion (within the Edmund P. Joyce Center), which reopened {{for the beginning of}} the 2009–2010 season. The team is coached by Mike Brey, who, as of the 2015–16 season, his fifteenth at Notre Dame, has achieved a 356–177 record. In 2009 they were invited to the NIT, where they advanced to the semi-finals but were beaten by Penn State who went on and beat Baylor in the championship. The 2010–11 team concluded its regular season ranked number seven in the country, with a record of 25–5, Brey's fifth straight 20-win season, and a second-place finish in the Big East. During the 2014–15 season, the team went 32–6 and won the ACC conference tournament, later advancing to the Elite 8, where the Fighting Irish lost on a missed buzzer-beater against then undefeated Kentucky. Led by NBA draft picks Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton, the Fighting Irish beat the eventual national champion Duke Blue Devils twice during the season. The 32 wins were the most by the Fighting Irish team since 1908–09.|$|E
50|$|Courageous <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> Intrepid (skippered by Gerry Driscoll and {{including}} William Earl Buchan and John Marshall), Heritage, Mariner and Valiant (skippered by BriggsCunningham) {{to become the}} defender.

50|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the rivalry is their ability to beat each other on any given day, {{including}} Grand Slam play, {{making it one of}} the most competitive and evenly matched rivalries in the Open Era. To date Federer is the only man to <b>have</b> <b>beaten</b> Djokovic in all four majors, and likewise Djokovic is the only man to <b>have</b> <b>beaten</b> Federer in all four majors. Both men accomplished this after <b>having</b> <b>beaten</b> each other at Wimbledon. Both players are generally considered to be the two greatest hard court players in the open era.|$|R

25|$|The tension {{resulted}} in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly lead to a confidential email sent by Chappell to the BCCI being leaked, in which he condemned the leadership and performance of Ganguly. After a series of high-profile board meetings and public jousting including some players, Rahul Dravid was installed as the captain, triggering a revival in the team's fortunes. The Indians subsequently defeated Sri Lanka 6-1 in a home series. An important part about this series was {{the discovery of the}} young talent of the team, including Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan. The team also beat the Sri Lankans in the Test series 2-0 to displace England from its position in second place in the ICC Test rankings, but India slipped back by losing the high-profile series to Pakistan. Indian team continued its good form in ODIs, beating Pakistan 4-1 in Pakistan. India achieved the world-record of winning 17 successive matches chasing the total. India convincingly won England's tour of India winning the series 5-1. After leveling the DLF Cup series 1-1 in Abu Dhabi, India travelled to West Indies where they lost the ODI series 1-4 to a weak West Indies team which was ranked 8th in the ICC ODI Ranking. The series loss again questioned the Indian team's ability to play away from the Sub-continent and the chances of the Indian team to win the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The Indian team later clinched the Test series against West Indies 1-0, the first Indian series win in the Caribbean since 1989. For the statistics of Indian cricket team after 2011 world cup, watch Indian cricket from 2011. Recently the Indian Cricket team <b>has</b> <b>beaten</b> the Australian cricket team with an impressive 2-1 victory in the 2017 Border-Gavaskar trophy and England by 4-0 in the 2016-17 Antony De Mello Trophy in the 5 match test series.|$|E

Marge's line [...] "When I first met your father, he was loud, crude and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person", is one of Susie Dietter's favorites, as it explains why Marge is still married to Homer despite his actions.|$|E
