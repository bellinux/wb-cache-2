The study of FT-IR spectra of PAN fibers samples with different comonomers shows that during stabilization of PAN fibers, the peaks related to C≡N bonds and CH 2 are reduced sharply. These reductions are related to cyclization of nitrile groups and stabilization procedure. This reduction in PAN <b>fibers</b> <b>contain</b> IA comonomer is very intense in comparison with PAN <b>fibers</b> <b>contain</b> SAMPS comonomer. This fact indicates the cycling and stabilization for sample contain IA comonomer have been conducted more completely.

Two kinds of intrafusal muscle fibers, a nuclear bag fiber and a nuclear chain fiber, {{have been identified in}} this region on the basis of fiber diameter, nuclear disposition, and M-band appearance.

Elements of the sarcotubular system, dilatations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the presence of other sarcoplasmic organelles and inclusions are considerably more abundant in the nuclear chain fiber than in the nuclear bag fiber. Leptomeric organelles and membrane-bounded sarcoplasmic granules are present in both intrafusal fiber types and may be situated between the myofibrils or in intimate association with the sarcolemma.

5000|$|Radar-absorbent {{material}} (RAM), {{often as}} paints, are used {{especially on the}} edges of metal surfaces.

Current technologies include dielectric composites and metal <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> ferrite isotopes. Paint comprises depositing pyramid like colonies on the reflecting superficies with the gaps filled with ferrite-based RAM.

5000|$|Rare but severe {{diseases}} such as mitochondrial myopathies are associated with dysfunctional human ADP/ATP translocase. Mitochondrial myopathies (MM) refer {{to a group of}} clinically and biochemically heterogeneous disorders that share common features of major mitochondrial structural abnormalities in skeletal muscle. The major morphological hallmark of MM is ragged, red <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> peripheral and intermyofibrillar accumulations of abnormal mitochondria. [...] In particular, autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) is a common disorder associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase and can induce paralysis of muscles responsible for eye movements. General symptoms are not limited to the eyes and can include exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, hearing deficit, and more. adPEO shows Mendelian inheritance patterns but is characterized by large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. mtDNA contains few introns, or non-coding regions of DNA, which increases the likelihood of deleterious mutations. Thus, any modification of ADP/ATP translocase mtDNA can lead to a dysfunctional transporter, particularly residues involved in the binding pocket which will compromise translocase efficacy. MM is commonly associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase, but MM can be induced through many different mitochondrial abnormalities.|$|E

We used isoform-specific antibodies and cDNA probes to investigate the molecular forms, developmental expression, and subcellular localization of the spectrins in skeletal muscle of the rat. We report that β-spectrin (βI) replaces β-fodrin (βII) at the sarcolemma as skeletal muscle fibers develop.

In the rat diaphragm muscle (DIAm), corticosteroid (CoS) treatment causes atrophy of <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> myosin heavy chain (MHC) : MHC 2 X and/or MHC 2 B. We hypothesized that DIAm fiber MND size is maintained during CoS-induced atrophy. Adult male rats received methylprednisolone for 11 days at 1 (CoS-Low, n = 8) or 8 mg x kg(- 1) x day(- 1) (CoS-High, n = 8). Age-matched (CTL-AgeM, n = 8), sham-operated (SHAM-AgeM, n = 8), and weight-matched (CTL-WtM, n = 8) animals served as controls. In single DIAm fibers, cross-sectional area (CSA), MND size, and MHC expression were determined. Fiber CSA and MND size were similar in CTL-AgeM and SHAM-AgeM groups. Only <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> MHCslow or MHC 2 A displayed smaller CSA in CTL-WtM than in CTL-AgeM and SHAM-AgeM groups, and MND size was reduced in all fibers. Thus <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> MHCslow and MHC 2 A maintain the number of myonuclei, whereas MHC 2 X or MHC 2 B fibers show loss of myonuclei during normal muscle growth. Both CoS groups displayed smaller CSA and MND size than CTL-AgeM and SHAM-AgeM groups. However, compared with CTL-WtM DIAm fibers, only <b>fibers</b> <b>containing</b> MHC 2 X or MHC 2 B displayed reduced CSA and MND size after CoS treatment. Thus little, if any, loss of myonuclei was associated with CoS-induced atrophy of MHC 2 X or MHC 2 B DIAm fibers. In summary, MND size {{does not appear to}} be regulated during CoS-induced DIAm atrophy...|$|E
