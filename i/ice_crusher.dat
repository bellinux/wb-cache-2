40|$|Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a trace gas, {{present in}} the troposphere, {{and also in the}} stratosphere, where it {{contributes}} to the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer. It has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural processes include uptake by plants, while oceans, wetlands, volcanism and biomass burning all contribute to natural COS emissions. We have measured COS in Antarctic ice cores from Dronning Maud Land, drilled in 1998, the DE 08 core drilled at Law Dome in 1987, and the DSS 0506 core drilled in 2006. Ice samples with COS gas ages between about 1050 AD and the early 20 th centrury have been examined. A large volume <b>ice</b> <b>crusher</b> at the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research laboratory was used to extract air from bubbles occluded in the ice cores. These air samples were analysed for CO 2, CH 4, CO and 13 CO 2 at CSIRO, and then for COS and several halocarbons at the University of East Anglia on a high sensitivity gas chromatograph/tri-sector mass spectrometer system. Initial results indicate that good sample integrity can be achieved. Measurements from the DML samples indicate low and uniform abundances across the last few hundred years, and at concentrations significantly below those in the modernday atmosphere. Measurements in more recent ice from DE 08 show the start of increasing concentrations in the early 1900 s, confirming earlier evidence that the global atmospheric abundance of COS has increased as a result of industrial activity during the 20 th century...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical model of ship ice-wedge interaction {{to study the}} effect of ship speed on level ice edge breaking. The interaction process is modeled using LS-DYNA. The developed model considers <b>ice</b> <b>crushing,</b> <b>ice</b> flexural failure and the water foundation effect. For the ice, two different plasticity-based material models are used to represent <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> and <b>ice</b> flexural behaviors. The water foundation effect is modeled using a simple linear elastic material. The analysis is performed for a ship speed range of 0. 1 to 5 ms- 1 and ice thickness of 0. 5 to 1. 5 m. The analysis indicates that both ship speed and ice thickness significantly affect the ice breaking process. The model results are in good agreement {{with a number of}} analytical and empirical models. The model can be useful in establishing a rational basis for safe speed criteria, improving ship structural standards and tools for ice management capability assessment.

The main purpose of this Master s thesis is to implement numerical ice loading models on an offshore wind turbine monopile structure, analyze ice induced vibrations and assess the importance of ice loads on offshore wind turbines. A model of offshore wind turbine monopile structure for time domain simulation will be established on FEDEM and ice loading spectral model will be implemented first. Ice force spectrum will be calculated from empirical formulas and ice loading time series will be generated and applied on structure model directly. In order to assess {{the performance of the}} spectral model, another ice-structure interaction model, Määttänen-Blenkarn model, is also applied on the offshore wind turbine monopile structure. The time domain simulation results from two models are analyzed and compared. The feasibility of both models for different ice speeds are investigated. The complex ice properties define the difficulty in ice load calculation. The relative speed between structure and ice will influence <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> strength. The existing spectral model is only feasible for continuous brittle crushing regime where structure response have little influence. But Määttänen-Blenkarn model considers structure response through stress rate dependent <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> strength and is also applicable for low to intermediate ice speeds. Simulation results also illustrate that different <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> modes of different ice speeds can be obtained from Määttänen-Blenkarn model and the results of spectral model for different ice speeds have similar characteristics. To better evaluate the impact of ice loads on offshore wind turbine structure, the coupling model of wind and ice loads will be applied in time domain simulation to investigate the joint effect of wind and ice loading. Fatigue damage assessment is also performed to see the structure damage induced by ice loads. The results illustrate that based on current model and data, ice loads are larger than wind loads and the fatigue damage caused by ice loads should be considered...|$|R

40|$|Ice is {{a unique}} and {{fascinating}} material. Much like the rock of the earth?s crust, sea ice can form a crust on the cold oceans of the world. The eastern coastal waters in Canada are prone to extensive ice coverage. Ice will often be the dominant consideration {{in the design of}} ships and offshore structures in Canadian waters. There are many Polar and sub-Polar areas of the world where sea ice is also the dominant natural feature and the key design challenge. Consequently, improving our understanding of ice loads is a topic of large practical significance, as well as being a fascinating scientific challenge. Several studies of <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> behavior have been conducted over of the past few decades. Some of the more recent investigations included in situ visual observations using indentors (Joensuu and Riska, 1988, Muhonen 1991, Gagnon, 1998; Fransson et al., 1991, Daley 1994) and a ship hull (Riska et al., 1990) that incorporated windows for viewing the indented ice surface. There have also been test apparatus that allowed viewing of the ice/indentor interface through the ice samples (Gagnon, 1994 a; Gagnon and M 8 lgaard, 1991). These have lead to significant new insights into the <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> process. Numerical contact process models based on available visual observations have been developed (Daley 1991, Daley et al. 1996). Further developments of these models is one of the continuing aims of this experimental work. The present study incorporates a similar concept to that of Wilson (1999), except that the strain rate is much higher, and is in the range associated with <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> rather than plastic deformation. The loads are much higher and the apparatus is correspondingly stronger. Experiments similar to the present ones have been performed by Gagnon (2004). While much {{progress has been made in}} the last 2 decades concerning the processes involved in <b>ice</b> <b>crushing,</b> considerable study remains in order to resolve divergent views that have developed. The importance of observing the ice behavior is, no doubt, a key factor. Here we report on-going development and results from a novel apparatus (Figure 1) designed to permit direct viewing of <b>ice</b> behavior during <b>crushing.</b> The goal for the design was to essentially take a slice of ice and observe its behavior during edge-on crushing as though it were part of a larger piece being crushed. The success of the apparatus until now has been limited because of in-plane fractures that persistently occurred in the ice specimens (Figure 5), with pulverized ice forming on one side of the fracture tending to obscure observations and likely influence the ice behavior (Gagnon and Daley, 2005).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate ice-structure interaction and develop a numerical model to predict the changes of ice loads and pressure during ice-structure interaction on non-planar surfaces. It is important to understand the sequential ice pressure and load development during ice-structure interaction. This is particularly true for non-planar surfaces as most ships and many offshore structures are composed of near-flat panels that may be dented as part of in-service loading leading to panels that are concave. An important question is whether these concave surfaces act as load-increasers for subsequent ice interaction. Most laboratory and field trial tests have been performed based on the assumption that the structural shape is flat. Therefore, little information is available for cases where the structure is concave due to plastic deformation, or specific areas with intentional structural concave shapes. In support of this objective, a series of laboratory-scale <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> tests were performed. Force, time and displacement data were measured. It was observed that <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> on concave shape indenters induced higher ice loads and pressure magnitudes compared to flat indenters. As part of the experimental program, techniques to use pressure measurement film were adopted to obtain ice-structure contact location, actual contact area, and changes of magnitude of pressure within the contact region. Following the experimental program a numerical model of <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> for concave surfaces was developed. In order to achieve valid numerical simulation results, a crushable foam model was modified by adding failure criteria. This followed the effect of indenter shape, level of confinement, test speed and cone angle to be evaluated in the numerical model and compared with the experimental results. The numerical model is shown to be valid for the flat indenter cases and the wedge and conical-shaped indenter cases. The findings from this study show that the shape of the indenting surfaces does influence ice forces and pressure and that generally, concave indentation surfaces lead to increases in pressure and force arising from <b>ice</b> <b>crushing.</b> These effects can be qualified globally and locally using the pressure measurement film, and the effects can be modeled numerically. This work demonstrates that the assumption of ice loads associated with flat or convex shapes may lead to under design for concave shapes or may lead to structural overload in cases where structures previously that have been indented...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} work {{is to develop a}} velocity dependent ice flexural failure model through numerical investigation of ship icebreaking process. In addition, the present work involves development of Excel-VBA software using this flexural failure model to determine ice impact load, minimum plate thickness, frame dimensions and safe speed methodology for Polar ships. First of all, individual material models of <b>ice</b> <b>crushing,</b> <b>ice</b> flexure and water foundation are developed using the FEM software package LS DYNA. Two different material models of ice are used to represent the <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> and <b>ice</b> flexure. The input parameters of these ice material models are selected from numerically conducted <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> test and four point bending test. The water foundation effect is modeled using a simple linear elastic material. The material models are incorporated into the numerical models of ship icebreaking. Two collision scenarios are considered for the ship icebreaking models; a head-on collision with a flat inclined ship face and a shoulder collision with an R-Class ship. In these models, the rigid ship impacts a cantilever ice wedge. The ice wedge rests on the water surface. Both collision scenarios are investigated with and without considering radial cracks in the level ice. The ice impact force and wedge breaking length are extracted from these numerical models of ship ice wedge breaking. Results indicate that the ship velocity, normal ship frame angle, ice wedge angle, ice thickness and radial crack significantly affect the breaking process. At higher ship velocities, the bending crack location shifts toward the <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> zone and results in a higher impact force. Higher impact force is produced for thicker ice, higher wedge angle and lower ship normal frame angle at a particular ship velocity. The existence of radial cracks reduces the magnitude of impact force and influences the breaking patterns. A methodology is presented to estimate the dynamic ice failure load using existing static failure models and dynamic amplification factors. The comparative study with these dynamic failure loads indicates that the developed numerical model results are in good agreement. A flexural failure model is developed based on validated numerical model results. The model provides velocity dependent force required to break an ice wedge in flexure. The developed model is validated with full scale test data and with non-linear finite element based dynamic bending model results. Application of this model is demonstrated to estimate the limit bow impact load and design ice load parameters. Finally, the Excel-VBA software “Safe Speed Check for Polar Ships” is developed using the velocity dependent flexural failure model and Polar Rules based limit state equations. This software and the velocity dependent flexural failure model are believed to help in establishing a rational basis for safe speed methodology as well as in improving ship structural standards and assessing ice management capability...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} couple of decades, the {{offshore}} wind industry has developed from applications in shallow water to ever deeper, more remote locations with harsher environments. In these progressively larger water depths, bottom founded support structures become no longer applicable and floating support structures could provide a viable alternative. Various studies have focused on floater designs for this application and multiple prototypes have been developed. However, no research has been done on the interaction of floating support structures with ice. In this thesis, the effect of level ice conditions on the dynamics of floating offshore wind turbines is studied. The MIT-NREL TLP is used as reference floater design. Based on the structure’s motions and mooring loads, a comparison is made between ice structure interaction and wave loading in harsh open water conditions. The combined floater and turbine arrangement is modelled in a rigid body approach, with three degrees of freedom (surge, heave and pitch). The system’s non-linear restoring stiffness is defined from contributions of its mooring system and hydrostatics. Hydrodynamic characteristics from fluid-structure interaction are derived with Ansys AQWA in frequency domain and transformed to time domain for the performed simulations. Wind and wave loading are covered, taking into account irregular wind velocity and wave height. Ice structure interaction is simulated for both failure of <b>ice</b> in <b>crushing</b> and bending modes. <b>Ice</b> <b>crushing</b> failure is simulated by the application of a Matlock-Sodhi model and is applied for vertical walled geometry. Ice loads from bending failure are considered for a sloping geometry at the waterline and are modelled by application of elastic beam- and friction-theory. Simulations of open water characteristics are performed for sea states with significant wave heights ranging from 2 to 14 meters. The results are compared to <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> for <b>ice</b> thickness ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 7 m and ice bending for ice thickness from 0. 25 to 1. 5 meters. From the simulations it is found that motion and mooring load maxima from ice bending loads for ice thickness up to approximately 1 m are in line with those for very harsh open water conditions. In the case of <b>ice</b> <b>crushing,</b> structure response is found to be far larger and more volatile, even for limited <b>ice</b> thickness. <b>Crushing</b> action of level ice with 0. 2 m thickness will already cause larger mooring loads than the most extreme open water condition considered (with a 14 m significant wave height). On top of that, dynamic amplification issues can arise as a result of ice loading near the structure’s natural frequencies. This mainly poses issues for the high energy loading of crushing, where motions and force variations are considerable for loads near the structure’s pitch natural frequency.

40|$|Ice {{interacting}} with offshore structures {{is one of}} the main concerns for engineering activities in arcticand sub-arctic areas. As new offshore structures are built or planned in these areas, the need to developmore accurate calculation methods of ice loads and the corresponding structural response is critical. Asignificant work regarding the level of ice forces and prediction methods have led to a new design codeISO/DIS 19906 (2009), trying to meet a consensus in arctic engineering. Several lighthouse structureslocated in the Gulf of Bothnia have experienced damage or failed due to loads from ice. Nygrånlighthouse was constructed in 1958 and collapsed in the spring, April 1969. In order to evaluatethe guidelines given ISO/DIS 19906 (2009), a re-investigation of the collapse was performed. Theseguidelines was compared to the guidelines given by IEC 61400 - 3 (2009) and API RP 2 N (2009). A finite element model of Nygrån lighthouse was developed based on the actual geometry. It wasfound that the global static design load according to ISO/DIS 19906 (2009) was about equal to thedesign load of the structure, while IEC 61400 - 3 (2009) and API RP 2 N (2009) gave loads that were 84 % and 250 % higher, respectively. According to the guidelines on dynamic ice action given inISO/DIS 19906 (2009), the structure was susceptible to resonant ice induced vibration caused byfrequency locked-in <b>ice</b> <b>crushing.</b> While according to IEC 61400 - 3 (2009) the structure should neverexperience frequency locked-in <b>ice</b> <b>crushing.</b> It was thought that the onset criterion in IEC 61400 - 3 (2009) was not conservative, compared to recent full-scale findings. If frequency locked-in ice crushingwould occur on the structure, the dynamic amplification of the displacement response would beup to a factor of 3. 4, while von Mises stress in the critical cross-section was amplified with a factorof 10. This was thought to be a result of inertial forces from the mass located above the waterline. Itis concluded that the highest stresses could not be calculated by simply amplifying the static loadsfrom <b>ice</b> <b>crushing.</b> In the light of new design codes, an alternative explanation of the collapse hasbeen derived. It was found that resonant ice induced vibrations may lead to a bending moment at thesurface of rupture 4. 5 times higher than the static collapse load. </p...|$|R

The ice contact zone consisted of an intact high-pressure central area surrounded by pulverized spall debris and partially refrozen melt. The removal of ice from the intact ice zone occurred through the viscous radial flow of a pressurized thin layer of melt. A sawtooth pattern was evident in the load record, due to spalling behavior. The movement of the platen and ice towards each other was intermittent, that is, slow on the ascending side of a sawtooth and very rapid on the descending side. Liquid was produced at the platen/ice interface during both the slow and rapid movements and was observed to create rapidly moving jets of ice and liquid (up to 40 m/s) emanating from the periphery of the contact zone during the load drops. The Saturnian moon Enceladus is an intriguing body consisting largely of water ice that exhibits great tectonic behavior in some areas, known as tiger stripes, and has been observed to eject plumes of water vapour and ice crystals from faults in these regions. The <b>ice</b> <b>crushing</b> mechanisms described here could occur when warm ice prominences, on opposing walls of open fissures in the upper regions of faults, crush against each other during the interfacial sliding events that are known to occur throughout the diurnal tidal stress cycle.

Furthermore, the liquid/solid ejecta itself may be jettisoned directly out of the fissures, upwards from the moon 2 ̆ 019 s surface to significant altitude, possibly even at escape velocity.
