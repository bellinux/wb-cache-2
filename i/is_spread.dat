5|$|The Himalia group <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> over barely 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been}} suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{the third}} lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) but <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing {{to the effect of}} summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the breeze is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.|$|E

30|$|Both Buddhism and Catholicism <b>were</b> <b>spread</b> {{into many}} {{countries}} {{all over the}} world. Buddhism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> {{to a number of}} Asian countries such as China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, and Bhutan to the north, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia to the south. 8 By the nineteenth century, Buddhism was introduced into Europe, Australia, America and then Africa by Western scholars and immigrants. 9 Like Buddhism, Catholicism <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Roman Empire and to north Europe through the fourth and fifth centuries. 10 By the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it <b>was</b> <b>spread</b> to America, Asia and Africa.|$|R
5|$|Apple scab: Apple scab causes {{leaves to}} develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also {{develops}} similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> through fungus growing in old apple {{leaves on the}} ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.|$|E
5|$|As a young woman, Satyavati met the {{wandering}} rishi (sage) Parashara, who fathered her son Vyasa out of wedlock.

5|$|Dengue <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{by several}} species of {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E

5|$|Further south, in Victoria and New South Wales, {{rainfall}} <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{more evenly}} {{throughout the year}} and the driest season lasts from December to May. At this time, southern populations congregate in inland flocking areas which include upland marshes, the edges of reservoirs and lakes, pastures and agricultural land. When rain arrives in June and July, they disperse to the coastal freshwater marshes, shallow lakes, wet meadows and other wetlands where they breed.|$|E
5|$|HCV <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{education}} is somewhat limited in Gaborone. 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10–64 who {{have heard of}} HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> through mosquito bites.|$|R

25|$|Group H streptococci cause {{infections in}} {{medium-sized}} canines. Group H streptococci rarely cause illness unless a human has {{direct contact with}} the mouth of a canine. One of the most common ways this can <b>be</b> <b>spread</b> <b>is</b> human-to-canine, mouth-to-mouth contact. However, the canine may lick the human's hand and infection can <b>be</b> <b>spread,</b> as well.|$|R

25|$|Because {{migratory birds}} {{are among the}} {{carriers}} of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it <b>is</b> <b>spreading</b> to {{all parts of the}} world.

5|$|ScottishPower Renewables {{also have}} {{permission}} to build 13 wind turbines near the aluminium smelter. They were initially refused planning permission, which they submitted in November 2006. This was because their site <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> over two council boundaries and Wansbeck Council approved the scheme, but Castle Morpeth refused. An appeal hearing {{was given in}} April 2008, and permission was eventually granted in January 2009 {{for the construction of}} up to 13 turbines, producing 30MW of electricity.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by {{respiratory}} droplets from {{an infected}} person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> {{through the}} air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|UCSF {{professor}} Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) violates {{orders from}} Cheever (relayed through Hextall) to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells.

Other scientists determine the virus <b>is</b> <b>spread</b> by fomites, with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates, with projections of one in twelve of the population being infected, and a 25-30% mortality rate.|$|E
