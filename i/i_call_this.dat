[...] "Especially since Janet only made records, not to disrespect Q-Tip or Heavy D, but as far as popular rappers in this day and time, Busta Rhymes was the only one. We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find somebody who can do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E
2500|$|Both {{series of}} Are You Afraid of the Dark? {{revolved}} around {{a group of}} teenagers who referred to themselves as [...] "The Midnight Society." [...] Every week, at a secret location in the woods, one member would tell a scary story to the group. The actual story, rather than the telling, was displayed to the television viewer. The story was shown between the group's arrival at the site and their departure. Each storyteller would begin their story by saying [...] "Submitted for {{the approval of the}} Midnight Society, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> story,”whatever" [...] at which point he or she would toss a handful of [...] "midnight dust" [...] from a leather pouch into a campfire to heighten the flames and produce an eerie white smoke.

[...] The storyteller would continue by announcing its title (The Tale of...).|$|E

5000|$|Raymond L. Garthoff {{wrote in}} 2004:In 1959 the ISS issued a {{pamphlet}} on the [...] "military balance" [...] between the Soviet Union and NATO. It was unfortunately replete with errors, having been put together from published sources of widely varying quality. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> {{to the attention}} of Alastair Buchan, the director of the institute, who was quite disturbed. A new version was issued in November 1960, much more correct and accurate, though still not up to the latest intelligence. Again, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> to Buchan's attention, and he undertook to check out with British authorities what became annual issuances.|$|R

2500|$|The musical {{opens in}} Marietta, Georgia, {{in the time}} of the American Civil War. The sounds of drums herald the {{appearance}} of a young Confederate soldier, bidding farewell to his sweetheart as he goes to fight for his homeland. The years pass and suddenly it is 1913. The young soldier has become an old one-legged veteran who is preparing to march in the annual Confederate Memorial Day parade ("The Old Red Hills of Home"). As the Parade begins ("The Dream of Atlanta"), Leo Frank, a Yankee Jew from Brooklyn, NYC, is deeply uncomfortable in the town in which he works and lives, feeling out of place due to his Judaism and his college education ("How Can <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> <b>This</b> Home?"). His discomfort is present even in his relationship with his wife, Lucille, who has planned an outdoor meal spoiled by Leo’s decision to go into work on a holiday. [...] Meanwhile, two local teens, Frankie Epps and Mary Phagan, ride a trolley car and flirt. [...] Frankie wants Mary to go to the picture show with him, but Mary playfully resists, insisting her mother will not let her ("The Picture Show"). [...] Mary leaves to collect her pay from the pencil factory managed by Frank.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>this</b> study Hesper, or the Cowboy Patrol for {{the reason}} that in [...] "the Cripple Creek War," [...] cattlemen had acted as {{outposts}} for the union miners, and in this fact I perceived something picturesque and new and telling, something which would give me just the imaginative impulse I required.|$|R
