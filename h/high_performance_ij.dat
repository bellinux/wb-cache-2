40|$|As the {{discipline}} of sport management matures, <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport management emerges as a swiftly developing branch of knowledge. The <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> industry and sport practitioners are leading the way by adopting practices that recognise the significance of managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport. Indicative of these practices is also the recognition and establishment {{of the role of}} <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors on athlete performance. These shifts in industry practices (i. e., hiring <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors and placing an emphasis on <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> management practices) have not been matched with an equivalent focus of academic inquiry that would help define the field, distinguish it from other fields and illustrate its significance in empirical ways. Chapter 1, written by Popi Sotiriadou, represents the start of an inquiry into defining {{the discipline}} of managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport and the roles of <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> directors in athlete success. The funnel of HPSM is comprised of three interrelated components; (a) <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> management (Part A of this book), (b) managing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> athletes (Part B of this book), and (c) issues in <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> sport (Part C of this book). The funnel of HPSM implies that athlete performance (at the lowest part of Figure A) is a factor of all three components. Unquestionably, performances at top-level sports are the result of a combination of the broader environmental and physical circumstances in which people live; the opportunities they are offered to excel through sport systems; and the genetic qualities they are born with and other athlete related issues. Accordingly, the factors that contribute to international sporting success can be classified at three different levels. The macro-level (Part A: <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Management), the meso-level (Part B: Managing <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Athletes) and the micro level (Part C: Issues in <b>High</b> <b>Performance</b> Sport). Factors at each level are systematically considered in the three parts of this this book. Griffith Business School, Department of Tourism, Sport and Hotel ManagementNo Full Tex...|$|R
