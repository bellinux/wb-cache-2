5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put {{them back in the}} line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Following</b> this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, now the Bakerloo line). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo. The route was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry & Company of Tregedar Works, Bow. Oxford Circus was altered below <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. The official opening of the BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS was between Baker Street and Lambeth North, then known as Kennington Road.|$|E
5|$|In an oddity, Greinke {{became the}} first pitcher to start three {{straight}} games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily throwing {{the ball into the}} <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. Before this, the most recent pitcher to start three consecutive games was Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts.|$|E

25|$|All three {{crew members}} on board died when the {{aircraft}} struck the <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> a stall and rapid descent {{caused by the}} crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing.

25|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.vestita has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. It has a lignotuber, so {{it is able to}} resprout from below the <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> a bushfire; bushfire also triggers the release of its seed, an adaptation known as serotiny.|$|E

500|$|The {{peace talks}} resumed in early July as Rhee's {{position}} apparently softened, yet this proved {{the impetus for}} a final Chinese offensive as they sought to further influence the talks and improve their defensive positions at the same time. On 14 July elements of five Chinese armies struck six South Korean divisions around the Kumsong salient. By 20 July the ROK Capitol Division {{and much of the}} ROK 3rd Division had been practically destroyed, exposing serious weaknesses despite two years of American training. The South Koreans fell back and the UN line was penetrated to a depth of [...] Only American intervention restored the situation and ultimately nine South Korean and US divisions were required to stem the Chinese offensive and regain some of the lost <b>ground.</b> <b>Following</b> a counter-attack by ROK II Corps a new defensive line was established south of the Kumsong River. Meanwhile, in conjunction with the main offensive at Kumsong, the Chinese 19th Army Group had conducted a series of limited offensives against US I Corps, with the 46th Army conducting five separate assaults against the US 1st Marine Division from 25 June to 27 July. Chinese losses were heavy nonetheless, and they sustained more than 28,000 casualties for only temporary gain.|$|E

500|$|The tunnel linings {{were formed}} from cast iron {{segments}} inch (2.22cm) thick, which locked {{together to form}} a ring with an internal diameter of [...] Once a ring was completed, grout was injected through holes in the segments to fill any voids between the outside edge of the ring and the excavated ground beyond, reducing subsidence. By November 1899 the northbound tunnel reached Trafalgar Square and work on some of the station sites was started, but the collapse of the L in 1900 led to works gradually coming to a halt. When the UERL was constituted in April 1902, 50 per cent of the tunnelling and 25 per cent of the station work was completed. With funds in place, work restarted and proceeded at a rate of [...] per week, so that by February 1904 virtually all of the tunnels and underground parts of the stations between Elephant & Castle and Marylebone were complete and works on the station buildings were under way. The additional stations were incorporated as work continued elsewhere and Oxford Circus station was altered below <b>ground</b> <b>following</b> a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. Although the BS had permission to continue to Paddington, no work was undertaken beyond Edgware Road.|$|E
500|$|Penney {{had joined}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1944, and had served on the Target Committee that had {{selected}} cities to be attacked.

He had returned to England in November 1945 intending to resume his academic career, but was approached by C. P.

His appointment as CSAR was announced on 1 January 1946, but Groves asked him to assist in the American Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Penney left for the United States in March 1946, and did not return to Britain until October 1946. Portal then asked him to draw up a scheme for an Atomic Weapons Section within the Armaments Research Department which would design, develop and construct atomic bombs. In his 1 November 1946 report to Portal, which he had to type himself for security reasons, Penney provided a proposed organisation chart, detailed his staffing requirements, and listed his accommodation requirements, which he felt could be met at Fort Halstead, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and Shoeburyness.|$|E
