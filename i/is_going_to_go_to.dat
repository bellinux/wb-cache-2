It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

50|$|In August 2012, Congressman Brad Sherman {{announced}} that he secured federal funds to help improve parks and public areas. His first project was to help restore sections of the 65 mile Backbone Trail, {{one of the most}} popular trails in the park and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Congressman said, “The Backbone Trail provides thousands of hikers, bicyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts with an unparalleled recreational experience through the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. These improvements will enhance that experience and improve safety for everyone that uses this popular trail.” The money <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> clearing back brush on the trails, fixing and preventing landslides along the trail, and repairing the Chicken Bridge in the park. Hikers have reported significant improvements to the trails, and the project was completed in 2013.|$|E

In an attempt to attract the policeman's attention, Brent makes noise by throwing objects at the doors, alerting the policeman of his presence. But when he opens the doors, Lola appears behind the policeman and Brent cannot say anything to warn him. Lola drives a meat cleaver into his face and the policeman falls down, dropping his gun. Brent attempts to shoot Lola, but she quickly moves {{out of the way}} where she finds Brent's necklace on the floor. She then informs Brent that she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his house and kill his mother, Carla for murdering her father, and Holly for breaking her heart. Brent notices a large pile of bones in the pit. That gives him the idea to pile up the dead bodies, and he manages to climb out.|$|E
5000|$|The Deer Hunter {{turns out}} to be the murdered husband of Tracy Solobotkin (Amanda Plummer), who is an {{employee}} in an organization that helps battered women. Kidnapping Liz, she reveals that she killed her husband in self-defense and decided to continue his legacy in the form of killing men who hurt other women. She claims her husband still [...] "pulls the strings from beyond the grave." [...] Liz disagrees with her, telling her she is just like her husband, that she enjoys the killing. The two argue. In a move reminiscent of when Tom killed the Harbor Master, Liz manages to choke her into unconsciousness, just as Ressler and the task force arrive.

After a while she announces she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war and tells Ivan not to open the door of the dungeon in the castle they live in while she will be away. Overcome by the desire to know what the dungeon holds, he opens the door soon after her departure and finds Koschei, chained and emaciated. Koschei asks Ivan to bring him some water; Ivan does so. After Koschei drinks twelve buckets of water, his magic powers return to him, he tears his chains and disappears. Soon after Ivan finds out that Koschei took Marya Morevna away, and chases him. When he gets him for the first time, Koschei tells Ivan to let him go, but Ivan doesn't give in, and Koschei kills him, puts his remains into a barrel and throws it into the sea. Ivan is revived by his sisters' husbands, powerful wizards, who can transform into birds of prey. They tell him Koschei has a magic horse and Ivan should go to Baba Yaga to get one too, or else he won't be able to defeat Koschei. After Ivan stands Yaga's tests and gets the horse, he fights with Koschei, kills him and burns his body. Marya Morevna returns to Ivan, and they celebrate his victory with his sisters and their husbands.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009 the {{opposition}} Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) and the Green Party (SZ) both demanded that Vesecká leave her post, citing {{concerns over the}} failed prosecution of Jiří Čunek, former deputy prime minister {{and chairman of the}} KDU-CSL party (the junior party in the governing coalition). Čunek had faced charages of corruption over an alleged 500,000-koruna bribe from the H&B Real Estate company, but his case was thrown out in late 2007. The dismissal of Čunek's case had in turn been criticized by Adam Basny, the District State Attorney for Liberec, whom Vesecká had then fired. Basny's dismissal prompted criticism from outside the Czech Republic and within: Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, said that if the state attorney's office was prepared to fire dissenters within its own ranks, it might next pursue opponents in wider Czech society. Vesecká also faced criticism from her predecessor Benesova, who accused Vesecká of membership in a [...] "judiciary mafia". The two opposition parties insisted that without Vesecká's departure they would not support the governing coalition, which had fallen following a vote of no confidence in its handling of the ongoing global financial crisis, but was expected to continue governing until an early election in October 2009. The Czech Association of State Attorneys in March 2009 also called on Vesecká to leave, but the governing Civic Democrats rejected calls for her removal. Vesecka has also been referred to as [...] "she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail" [...] by Kristyna Koci, as she was being secretly taped in the Spring 2011, trying to split her own party VV(Public affairs) by performing a coup based on bribery accusations with the help of Petr Tluchor and some other Civic Democtrats.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a further}} {{statement}} on 8 December 2004, Bainimarama issued a further {{warning to the}} government that the military [...] "would put pressure on anyone" [...] who tampered with national security, and condemned the inclusion {{in the government of}} persons implicated in the 2000 coup, saying that their presence justified his earlier criticism of the Fiji Week reconciliation ceremonies. [...] "That's why we've always said the reconciliation process was a farce," [...] Bainimarama said. [...] "The 2001 Elections brought back all of George Speight's group except him." [...] He went on to issue a veiled threat to the political establishment: [...] "If we don't act, this country <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the dogs and no investor will want to come here." [...] He reiterated the threat on 4 January 2005, when he likened the military to a tiger sitting in the corner. [...] "You have to give it (the tiger) room," [...] he said. [...] "If you don't give it room, it will bite you," [...] he told The Review, a prominent newspaper. His remarks were taken as a clear signal {{that he would not be}} silenced. In the same interview, he condemned what he saw as the Qarase government's policy of letting people implicated in the 2000 coup get off [...] "scott free," [...] warning that it would lead to [...] "a criminal generation" [...] as children would be raised [...] "without recognition of the law." [...] This would lead, he said, to a security threat. He said that political interference in police investigations into the coup, together with the government's lenience towards its perpetrators, was making a mockery of the judicial system. [...] "If we don't put our foot down, they will release every man and his dog," [...] he said on 6 January 2005.|$|E
