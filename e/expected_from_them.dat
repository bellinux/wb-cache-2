500|$|Carey and her husband, Tommy Mottola, {{who was a}} Sony CEO, {{separated}} in 1997. This resulted in a strained relationship with Sony. By the spring of 1999, Carey had begun work on her last album of her contract with Columbia Records, titled Rainbow. Her relationship with Sony had affected her collaboration with writing partner Walter Afanasieff, {{who had worked with}} her throughout the first half of her career. As a result, she worked extensively with many other songwriters and producers for the album, including the duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, known for their work with Janet Jackson. [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] was written by Jam and Lewis and co-written by Carey. When Jam and Lewis first started working with Carey, they did not have a definite idea of what Carey <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> In an interview with Fred Bronson, Jam and Lewis explained: ...|$|E

2500|$|Moroccan women {{represent}} the most economically insecure social {{group in the}} country. One of six Moroccan households are lone-mother households, which {{represent the}} most impoverished households in the country. Women are categorized to have {{the highest levels of}} socio-economic and legal constraints, which exclude them from obtaining their basic needs. Although recent surveys show that women actively help in providing for their families economically, Moroccan legal texts discourage women's participation in economic productivity. Article 114 of the Moroccan Family Law states, [...] "every human being is responsible for providing for his needs by his own powers except the wife whose needs will be taken care of by her husband." [...] The patriarchal social structure of Morocco puts women as being inferior to men in all aspects. Women are denied equal opportunities in education and employment before the law, as well as access to resources. As a result, the female population in Morocco suffers from deprivation of capabilities. Young girls are often excluded from educational opportunities due to limited financial resources within the household and the burden of household chores <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the American Civil War Ordronaux {{served as}} an army surgeon {{stationed}} in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks {{on the health of}} armies, and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, [...] "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, {{in order to be able}} to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared." ...|$|E

60|$|Last {{days are}} wretched days; {{and so are}} last moments wretched moments.

Spasmodic periods of pleasure, of affection, or even of study, seldom fail of disappointment when premeditated. When last days are coming, they should be allowed to come and to glide away without special notice or mention. And as for last moments, there should be none such. Let them ever be ended, even before their presence has been acknowledged.|$|E

60|$|As for {{the hostility}} of the Entente, {{it is of}} course true that Bolshevism might have {{developed}} very differently {{if it had been}} treated in a friendly spirit. But in view of its desire to promote world-revolution, no one could expect--and the Bolsheviks certainly did not expect--that capitalist Governments would be friendly. If Germany had won the war, Germany would have shown a hostility more effective than that of the Entente. However we may blame Western Governments for their policy, we must realize that, according to the deterministic economic theory of the Bolsheviks, no other policy was to be <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> Other men might have been excused for not foreseeing the attitude of Churchill, Clemenceau and Millerand; but Marxians could not be excused, since this attitude was in exact accord with their own formula.|$|E

Then he glanced at his startled carriers, who had thrown down their burdens and huddled together. There was, of course, nothing to be <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> and his few armed retainers were evidently not to be relied upon. In fact, they were gazing longingly at the bush, and it was clear that they were ready to make a dash for its shelter. They had done his bidding truculently when {{it was a question of}} overawing down-trodden bushmen and keeping defenseless carriers on the march, but to face resolute men with rifles was a different matter, and their courage was not equal to the task.

Wherefore, missing of the help that he <b>expected</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> and finding his army warmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling, (for that I will say for the captains, that considering the weakness that yet was upon them by reason of the long sickness that had annoyed the town of Mansoul, they did gallantly behave themselves,) he was forced to make some retreat from Mansoul, and to entrench himself and his men in the field without the reach of the slings of the town.|$|E

60|$|The {{point was}} one of vital importance, as the natives of Happar were not only at peace with Nukuheva, but {{cultivated}} with its inhabitants the most friendly relations, and enjoyed beside a reputation for gentleness and humanity which led us to <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> <b>them,</b> if not a cordial reception, at least a shelter during the short period we should remain in their territory.|$|R
