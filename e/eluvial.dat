5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and <b>eluvial</b> soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
25|$|Soils are variable. Peat {{is common}} in poorly drained flats and even on sloping ground in the wetter areas. Where {{drainage}} is good, the mature soils are podzols which have classic development (well defined <b>eluvial</b> horizon, Ae under Canadian classification) in undisturbed areas. A history of disturbance, as from logging or windthrow, sees the Ae mixed with other horizons and only patchily visible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eluvial</b> deposits—those {{that had}} {{weathered}} from the lode {{in the usual}} way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits {{due to the lack}} of sorting that a stream provides, and they usually did not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eluvial</b> ore {{deposits}} {{are those}} such as tungsten and gold placer deposits formed by settling and enriched by the winnowing or removal of lower density materials. Diamonds within yellow ground (weathered portions of kimberlites) {{may be considered}} to be <b>eluvial</b> deposits. Cassiterite and columbite-tantalite deposits also occur as residual or <b>eluvial</b> concentrations. The Pitinga tin deposit in Brazil, an <b>eluvial</b> deposit, {{is one of the largest}} tin mines in the world. Weathering supergene enrichment of an apatite rich carbonatite in Ontario has produced a significant <b>eluvial</b> phosphate ore deposit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{soil horizon}} formed due to {{eluviation}} is an <b>eluvial</b> zone or <b>eluvial</b> horizon. In a typical soil profile, the <b>eluvial</b> horizon {{refers to a}} light-colored zone located (depending on context and literature) either at {{the lower part of}} the A horizon (symbol: Ae) or within a distinct horizon (E horizon) below the A, where the process is most intense and rapid. Yet some sources consider the <b>eluvial</b> zone to be the A horizon plus the (distinct) E horizon, as eluviation technically occurs in both.|$|E

50|$|The 2 great {{groups of}} Luvisolic soils are {{distinguished}} {{mainly on the}} basis of soil temperature. Gray Brown Luvisols have a dark Ah horizon in which organic matter has been mixed with the mineral material (commonly by earthworm activity), a brown, often platy <b>eluvial</b> horizon (Ae) and an illuvial horizon (Bt) in which blocky structure is common. Their mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher. The major area of Gray Brown Luvisols is found {{in the southern part of}} the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Lowlands. Gray Luvisols have <b>eluvial</b> and illuvial horizons and may have an Ah horizon if the mean annual soil temperature is below 8 °C. Vast areas of Gray Luvisols in the Boreal Forest Zone of the Interior Plains have thick, light grey <b>eluvial</b> horizons underlying the forest litter and thick Bt horizons with clay coating the surface of aggregates.|$|E

50|$|Coffee, cotton, fruits, {{rice and}} tobacco {{are the major}} {{agricultural}} products. The province has large deposits of alluvial and <b>eluvial</b> diamonds and Gypsum. Sumbe and Porto Amboim are major fish processing centres.|$|E
5000|$|The strict <b>eluvial</b> horizon (E horizon) is {{typically}} light gray, clay-depleted, contains little organic matter {{and has a}} high concentration of silt and sand particles composed of quartz and other resistant minerals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diagnostic}} horizons at {{the soil}} surface are called epipedons (from the Greek epi, [...] "over", and pedon, [...] "soil"). The {{presence or absence of}} these particular diagnostic surface horizons help soil scientists determine the place of a soil within the Soil classification system. The epipedon includes {{the upper part of the}} soil darkened by organic matter and/or the upper <b>eluvial</b> horizons. It may also include the B horizon if the <b>eluvial</b> horizons are sufficiently darkened by organic matter. All soils must have one epipedon. Eight epipedons are recognized, but only five occur naturally over wide areas. The five naturally occurring epipedons are called the mollic epipedon, umbric epipedon, ochric epipedon, melanic epipedon, and histic epipedon.|$|E

50|$|Alluvial or <b>eluvial</b> {{deposits}} {{sometimes have}} the largest gold deposit and are very common. This deposit is created when {{a force of nature}} moves or washes the gold away, but it doesn’t go into a stream bed. It contains pieces of ore that have been washed away from the lode.

50|$|The Jarrah WoodlandsThe Duricrusted plateau of {{the western}} edge of the Yilgarn Craton is characterised by Jarrah-Marri forest on {{laterite}} gravels and, in the eastern part, by Marri-Wandoo woodlands on clayey soils. <b>Eluvial</b> and alluvial deposits support Agonis shrublands. In areas of Mesozoic sediments, Jarrah forests occur in a mosaic with a variety of species-rich shrublands. This area has been heavily logged for timber, Jarrah here being largely regrowth.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the last}} ice age, silt deposits, borne mostly from {{the erosion of the}} Scarborough Bluffs and the <b>eluvial</b> rivers to the east were swept by strong, natural Lake Ontario {{currents}} creating prominent fingers of land away from the lakeshore in the current central waterfront area, including the Toronto Islands.The shore of Lake Ontario (at least within present-day Toronto Harbour) is mostly landfill, extending a kilometre or more from the natural shoreline.|$|E
50|$|The main {{geological}} formations distributed {{across the}} town and its surroundings are turbidites. The most common rock in the area is slate. In {{the west of the}} town slate enriched by apatite and zircon can be found. In the east of the town lighter forms of slate occur. Fluvial sands and rubble together with deluvial sediments of clay and sand origin lie along the rivers and creeks. <b>Eluvial</b> sediments prevail in the west part of the town.|$|E

Surfaces are associated with the occluded drainage occur throughout with hummock grasslands on Quaternary sandplains, saltbush shrublands on calcareous soils and Halosarcia low shrublands on saline alluvia. Areas of red sandplains are covered with mallee-mulga parkland over hummock grasslands occurring widely in the east.|$|E
50|$|Berkshire {{soil series}} {{is the name}} given to a well drained loam or sandy loam soil which has {{developed}} on glacial till in parts of southern Quebec, eastern New York State and New England south to Massachusetts. It belongs to the podzol soil group {{and is one of}} the most important soils in its area of occurrence, supporting extensive forests and a fair number of farms. Many Berkshire soils lack the <b>eluvial</b> (E) horizon characteristic of podzols because they have a history of being cleared for cultivation.|$|E
50|$|A 1959 {{soil map}} identifies, {{from north to}} south, the {{following}} complex units: Kye-Coastal Beach; Bowser-Custer; Parksville-Bowser. Kye loamy sand is a classic podzol with well-defined <b>eluvial</b> (A2 or Ae) horizon. This series supports the well-drained forests. Coastal Beach land type represents bare or grassy regosol sand. The imperfectly drained Bowser loamy sand is podzolic but usually {{does not have an}} A2 horizon. Similarly moist loamy sand podzolic soils with strong A2 development are assigned to the Custer series. The Parksville sandy loam represents poorly drained gleysolic soils.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} removal of {{materials}} from geological or soil horizons is called eluviation or leaching. There {{is a difference}} in the usage of this term in geology and soil science. In soil science, eluviation is the transport of soil material from upper layers of soil to lower levels by downward precipitation of water across soil horizons, and accumulation of this material (illuvial deposit) in lower levels is called illuviation. In geology, the removed material is irrelevant, and the deposit (<b>eluvial</b> deposit) is the remaining material. Eluviation occurs when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eluvial</b> deposits—those {{that had}} {{weathered}} from the lode {{in the usual}} way, but had not then been transported by flowing water—were also worked; these tended to be poorer deposits {{due to the lack}} of sorting that a stream provides, and they usually did not have such a ready supply of water available to work them. They are found on gently sloping hillsides. Where possible the water needed to work these deposits was carried by a leat from the nearest available river, or if the site was above such supplies, reservoirs were constructed to collect rainwater and runoff from hillsides.|$|E
50|$|During biostasy, {{abundant}} and regular precipitation induces strong pedogenesis characterized by chemical alteration of parent material and intensified eluviation and illuviation of soil minerals within the surface soil and subsoil layers (the solum). These processes {{contribute to the}} formation of <b>eluvial</b> and argillic horizons and an increased concentration of iron oxides, aluminum oxides, and other sesquioxides in the subsoil. Climatic conditions favor a vegetative cover which protects the soil from physical erosion but abundant rainfall results in the loss of mineral ions and increased concentration of those minerals in receiving bodies of water. Abundant marine calcium results in limestone formation.|$|E
50|$|The main {{process in}} the {{formation}} of podzols is podzolisation. Podzolisation is a complex process (or number of sub-processes) in which organic material and soluble minerals (commonly iron and aluminium) are leached from the A and E horizons to the B horizon. It involves mobilization and precipitation of dissolved organic matter, together with aluminum and iron as they leach down from the A and E horizons to the B horizon. Through this process the overlying <b>eluvial</b> horizons are bleached. The complexes move to the brown, red or black horizon, which consist of cemented sesquioxides and/or organic compounds. Podzolisation occurs under low pH values.|$|E
5000|$|These soils have <b>eluvial</b> horizons {{from which}} clay has been leached after {{snowmelt}} or heavy rains and illuvial horizons in which clay has been deposited; these horizons are designated Ae and Bt respectively. In saline or calcareous materials, clay translocation is preceded by leaching of salts and carbonates. Luvisolic soils occur typically in forested areas of subhumid to humid climate where the parent materials contain appreciable clay. Luvisolic soils cover about 809 000 km2 (8.8%) of Canada's land area. Large areas of Luvisolic soils {{occur in the}} central to northern Interior Plains; smaller areas in all regions south of the permafrost zone.|$|E
50|$|Kimberlites are {{the most}} {{important}} source of primary diamonds. Many kimberlite pipes also produce rich alluvial or <b>eluvial</b> diamond placer deposits. About 6,400 kimberlite pipes have been discovered in the world, of those about 900 have been classified as diamondiferous, and of those just over 30 have been economic enough to diamond mine. The deposits occurring at Kimberley, South Africa, were the first recognized and the source of the name. The Kimberley diamonds were originally found in weathered kimberlite which was colored yellow by limonite, and so was called yellow ground. Deeper workings encountered less altered rock, serpentinized kimberlite, which miners call blue ground.|$|E
50|$|The shallow, rocky {{sandy loam}} soils of the summits are mostly covered in forest. Where the {{underlying}} rock {{is rich in}} olivine, as over large areas of Mont Saint-Bruno and Mont Rougemont, these soils are classed as dystric brunisol. Podzol tends to develop over rock which lacks olivine, although many of these podzols lack an <b>eluvial</b> (Ae) horizon. Lower slopes are covered with aprons of gravel or sand. The sandy soils are usually podzols with classic Ae development; they often have subsoil hardpan and are undesirable for agriculture. The free-draining gravels are preferred for apple orchards, which grow in thermal belts where cold air can drain to the valley floor.|$|E
50|$|Sri Lanka, geologically {{speaking}} is {{an extremely}} old country. Ninety percent of the rocks of the island are of Precambrian age, 560 million to 2,400 million years ago. The gems form in sedimentary residual gem deposits, <b>eluvial</b> deposits, metamorphic deposits, skarn and calcium-rich rocks. Nearly all the gem formations in Sri Lanka {{are located in the}} central high-grade metamorphic terrain of the Highland Complex. The gem deposits are classified as sedimentary, metamorphic and magmatic; the sedimentary types being the most abundant. The mineralogy of the gem deposits varies widely with, among others, corundum (sapphire, ruby), chrysoberyl, beryl, spinel, topaz, zircon, tourmaline, garnet being common.|$|E

50|$|The island's soils have {{developed}} from marine deposits of variable texture, {{except for the}} higher elevations and steeper slopes where weathered clastic sedimentary rock provides the parent material. Most of Hornby's soils are sandy or gravelly, but some deep black loams occur in the northwestern part {{and many of the}} sands at the southern end have loam-textured topsoils. Podzols are common and the bleached sand grains associated with their <b>eluvial</b> (A2, Ae or E) horizons lend a salt-and-pepper appearance to many forest trails. In most cases, though, the E is not very thick and may be discontinuous. On this account, the soils were mostly classified as Brown Podzolic in a soil survey published in 1959. All of the island's soils are strongly acidic in their natural state except for those which {{have developed}} on shoreline shell middens.|$|E
