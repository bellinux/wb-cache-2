Washington returned to New York City after only {{a period of about}} a year in Guatemala, and then began pursuing the main part of his career <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> manufacture. His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> prices and sell at the best price.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{sometimes}} {{cause problems}} when they raid fruit crops, but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests {{such as the}} woodboring beetles that create galleries behind the bark and can kill trees. They also eat ants, which may be tending sap-sucking pests such as mealybugs, {{as is the case}} with the rufous woodpecker <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations in India. Woodpeckers can serve as indicator species, demonstrating the quality of the habitat. Their hole-making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of the ecosystem, because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes, as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|A typical bean of Coffea arabica {{contains}} about 0.4-0.7% cafestol by weight. Cafestol {{is present in}} highest quantity <b>in</b> unfiltered <b>coffee</b> drinks such as French press coffee or Turkish coffee/Greek <b>coffee.</b> <b>In</b> filtered <b>coffee</b> drinks such as drip brewed coffee, it is present in only negligible amounts, as the paper filter <b>in</b> drip filtered <b>coffee</b> retains the diterpenes.|$|R

50|$|Many coffee {{retailers}} simply use hot-brewed <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> their iced <b>coffee</b> drinks. Starbucks specifically {{uses the}} double-strength method <b>in</b> which the <b>coffee</b> is brewed hot with twice {{the amount of}} grounds. With this method, the melted ice does not dilute the strength and flavor of the coffee. Unlike the cold-brew process, this method does not eliminate the acidity inherent <b>in</b> hot-brewed <b>coffee.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Coffee</b> County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a fallen tree in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union caused a major decline <b>in</b> Cuban <b>coffee</b> production, going from 440,000 60-pound bags of <b>Coffee</b> <b>in</b> the 19891990 production cycle to eventually reaching an all-time low of 7000 bags during the 20072008 cycle.

25|$|According to the 2000 census, Maricao is {{the second}} least populous {{municipality}} in Puerto Rico, above the island municipality of Culebra, with 6,449 inhabitants. The population of the town has decreased during the past decades perhaps due to the decline <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> production and the deteriorating economy. In 1899, the population was 8,312. The current population density is 174.2 people per square mile (67.0/km²).|$|E

25|$|Polyphenols <b>in</b> <b>coffee</b> {{have been}} shown to affect free {{radicals}} in vitro, but {{there is no evidence that}} this effect occurs in humans. Polyphenol levels vary depending on how beans are roasted as well as for how long.

25|$|Caffeine can be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation.

50|$|Coffee {{historically}} {{has been a}} major factor in the Colombian economy. Since the middle of the twentieth century, however, its relative importance has been decreasing, largely as a natural outcome of the country's development process. The increase in the share of the services sector, as the nation has developed, corresponded to the reduction of <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> both GDP and exports. Whereas <b>in</b> 1985 <b>coffee</b> exports represented 51 percent of total exports in value terms, they represented less than 6 percent in 2006. However, the relative decline <b>in</b> <b>coffee's</b> share of both GDP and exports should not imply that coffee has ceased to be a determining factor both in economic and social terms. The livelihoods of an estimated 566,000 families, some 2.3 million Colombians, depend entirely on coffee.|$|R
