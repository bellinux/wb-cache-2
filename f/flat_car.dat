25|$|Autorack and <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> length quickly grew to 87 feet (26.52m) {{and then}} 89 feet (27.13m) to {{increase}} their loading capacity even further. This made them {{about as long as}} the average railroad passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they wouldn't be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better.|$|E

25|$|UP 1243 is a 4-6-0 steam {{locomotive}}, and is {{the oldest}} locomotive owned by UP. Built in 1890 and retired in 1957, it was at first stored in Rawlins, Wyoming. It was cosmetically restored in 1990 for public display, and toured with 844 {{as part of the}} Idaho and Wyoming Centennial train, being moved on a <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> It was moved to Omaha, Nebraska in November 1996 and put on display at the Western Heritage Museum.|$|E
25|$|The F-Line fleet also {{includes}} a fleet of pre-PCC vintage cars built between 1895 and 1924 for use in San Francisco. Three passenger cars were built for Muni itself, and a further two for the independent Market Street Railway Company that ran competing streetcar services in San Francisco until acquired by Muni in 1944. The final car is a works <b>flat</b> <b>car,</b> built for Muni in 1916 and used for hauling rails, ties, and other materials needed to maintain a streetcar system.|$|E

25|$|Seeking a more {{efficient}} method, in February 1959 the Saint Louis-San Francisco Railroad (SL-SF, or Frisco) designed and built a prototype bi-level rack mounted on 42-foot <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> SL-SF 95844. Satisfied that the basic concept was sound, the railroad contracted with Pullman-Standard to design and construct a full-size tri-level prototype. The result that rolled out of the Pullman plant on January 29, 1960 was SLSF 3000, an 83-foot tri-level car capable of carrying 12 automobiles. When testing proved the car satisfactory the Frisco ordered 130 production cars, SL-SF 3001â€“3130, delivered by Pullman that August and September.|$|E
25|$|Another joint General Motors-Southern Pacific {{automobile}} {{rail car}} was the Stac-Pac. It {{was designed to}} carry 12 high end Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac models in four removable fully enclosed tri-level containers per 89-foot <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> The first production Stac-Pac cars entered service in October, 1971. Beside SP and its Cotton Belt subsidiary (SSW), Stac-Pac flat cars were contributed to the pool by the Santa Fe and Trailer Train, with the containers being supplied by ATSF, BN, D, FEC, MILW, PC (MDT), RI, Southern, SP, SSW, UP, and by General Motors itself. All of the cars and containers were withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} the 1976 model year.|$|E
25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|E

Peak production output is approximately 50 cars per week. The TrentonWorks plant is currently operating below capacity due to decreased demand for new railcars with currently employment levels at 200 workers, however peak employment has ranged beyond 1,100 workers in recent years.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the local}} sheriff and local residents {{arrived at the}} scene of the crash. The thrust from the still-idling jet engine allowed the aircraft to slowly drift on its belly along a field. The sheriff, having contacted the air base, was informed that he should simply allow the jet to run out of fuel, which occurred an hour and forty-five minutes later without further incident. A recovery crew from McClellan Air Force Base arrived on the scene and began to dismantle the aircraft, removing its wings for transport aboard a railroad <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> The damage to the aircraft was minimal; indeed, one officer on the recovery crew is reported to have stated that if there were any less damage he would have simply flown the aircraft out of the field.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E
25|$|The last {{regularly}} scheduled passenger train {{passed through the}} tunnel in 1958. As of 2012, the tunnel is part of Pan Am Railways, formerly the Guilford Rail System, with trains operated by subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway, and the property and infrastructure owned by subsidiary Boston and Maine Corporation. The route is currently used to transport freight, but sees rare excursion trains for some special occasions. It was converted to single track in 1957. Clearances were increased in 1997 and 2007, the former by lowering the track, the latter by grinding 15inches off the roof, allowing trailer on <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> (TOFC) and tri-level automobile carriers to pass. In March 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded a $2 million grant to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for preliminary engineering on further increasing clearance in the tunnel to allow double stack container trains to use the tunnel.|$|E

5000|$|In 1893, the Sandy River Railroad {{purchased}} a larger 2-6-0 mogul locomotive to carry bridge traffic from the connecting F&M and P&R railroads, and {{purchased a}} baggage-RPO {{car for the}} Farmington-Rangeley passenger trains it operated jointly with the P&R. Locomotive #3 was sold to the Wiscasset and Quebec Railroad in 1894. The Sandy River Railroad had 16 box <b>cars</b> and 13 <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in 1894, and ordered 4 box <b>cars</b> and 8 <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> from the Portland Company that year. Portland Company delivered 10 more box cars and 10 more <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in 1897. The Sandy River Railroad had Jackson & Sharpe build the parlor car [...] "Rangeley" [...] in 1901 for wealthy tourists traveling to Rangeley via narrow gauge passenger trains. It was the only [...] gauge parlor car in the United States.|$|R
500|$|Originally the {{locomotive}} had a [...] "diamond" [...] smoke stack. It is unknown {{when that was}} changed to a straight [...] "shotgun" [...] stack. Sometime during the early 20th century {{the locomotive}} was converted from coal burning to oil burning and its wooden [...] "cowcatcher" [...] pilot was replaced with a steel pipe pilot. [...] The wooden cab was replaced with an all-steel cab, and its kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp was replaced with an electric one. [...] When the engine was relocated from Louisiana to Vermont its steel cab roof was removed {{in preparation for the}} ride on a <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> [...] The roof was later mistaken for scrap metal as a worker at Steamtown cut out a piece for use as a stack cover for the locomotive. [...] In 1970 the train underwent what the Steamtown Historical Study refers to as a [...] "misguided" [...] restoration, and given a diamond-shaped smoke stack and a kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp, both of which bearing very little resemblance to the stack and headlamp originally worn by the engine. [...] The restoration thus gave the engine an appearance unlike any form it had assumed during its service life.|$|E
2500|$|Monson {{became the}} last of Maine's - and the nation's - [...] gauge railroads in {{commercial}} operation when the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad was dismantled in 1941. Infrequent <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> loads of crated slate products moved to Monson Junction until July 12, 1943. [...] On that date Monson Slate Company received permission to use a highway truck for common carrier service. [...] The railroad was dismantled {{during the winter of}} 1943-44 and the engine house became a garage for the truck.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot highway trailers in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916 Monson's {{location}} {{provided an}} opportunity to purchase the longest freight cars operated by the railroad. [...] The Sandy River Railroad shop at Phillips, Maine was rebuilding 185 older [...] gauge logging railroad <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> into what became a fleet of 158 -long <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> of the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad being purchased by the Maine Central Railroad in 1912. [...] The Maine Central simultaneously contracted with Boyd and Harvey Lumber Company to cut railroad ties in the western Penobscot River drainage of the roadless Maine North Woods. [...] The lumber company built the [...] gauge Carry Pond and Carry Brook Railroad in 1914 over the northwest carry from {{the eastern end of}} Seboomook Lake to Northwest Cove at the northern end of Moosehead Lake. [...] Draft animals pulled two 28-foot-long <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> over the railroad to deliver the ties to Moosehead Lake where they were floated across the lake for loading at Kineo Station on the northern end of the Maine Central Railroad Kineo Branch. [...] After the ties had been delivered, the lumber company sold the two <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> to the closest [...] gauge railroad at Monson.|$|R

2500|$|After {{discussion}} with Dow, Father Brophy {{decided to build}} the largest wooden crucifix in the world on Calvary Hill, located north of the Long House Chapel. In July 1952, Bishop Babcock granted them permission to begin the project. The foundation of the Cross required a [...] high steel and concrete base which was covered with soil, creating a hill [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. In the summer of 1952, redwood timber was custom cut with a chain saw from a lumber yard in Oregon and shipped on a railroad <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> It took two days to assemble the Cross. Cranes lifted it to the foundation August 5, 1954, where it was secured. It stands [...] tall.|$|E
2500|$|The viaduct was [...] "substantially complete" [...] in June 1835 {{from various}} {{accounts}} of horse-drawn cars passing over it during that time. [...] The viaduct was built {{before the advent}} of construction safety equipment such as hard hats and fall arrest devices. [...] Surprisingly, no deaths were recorded during the construction, but deaths have occurred at the viaduct since completion; mainly from people crossing it while trains passed in opposite directions. [...] Charlie, the old white horse who had hauled the empty railcars back to Sharon, Massachusetts (4 miles), was placed upon the <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> and hauled across the viaduct by the workers, thus becoming the first [...] "passenger" [...] to cross the structure.|$|E
2500|$|The labyrinthine salt mine has {{a single}} entrance, and a small {{gasoline-powered}} narrow-gauge engine pulling a <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> was utilized to navigate to the various caverns created by centuries of salt mining. [...] Into these spaces, workmen built storage rooms which boasted wooden floors, racks specifically designed to hold the paintings and other art works, up-to-date lighting, and dehumidification equipment. [...] Despite {{the fact that the}} salt was mined using pipes and sluices through which flowed gravity-fed water from the mountain, which carried dissolved salt 17 miles away to Bad Ischl, where the water was evaporated, leaving behind the salt, the mine was not naturally humid, as the salt in the mine's walls absorbed excess moisture, keeping the chambers at a constant 65% humidity, while the temperature only varied from a low of 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to 47 degrees in the summer. [...] Mining operations continued as the artwork was loaded into the mines, with the miners occasionally dragooned into helping to unload.|$|E
