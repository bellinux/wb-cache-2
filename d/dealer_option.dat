Torana was now rationalised to a choice of two equipment levels and two six-cylinder engines, the 2.85-litre and the 3.3-litre.

5000|$|A new-car {{dealership}} could {{contract with}} any aftermarket company to add any option {{they wanted to}} add to a car, {{as long as it}} did not compromise the structural integrity or cause warranty problems on that car. Options like roof-racks, sunroofs, leather interiors, spoilers, rustproofing and all sorts of things could be done to a new car, even if the car manufacturer {{had nothing to do with}} that product or conversion. The conversion van phenomenon is a very similar process. The convertible conversion was billed as a <b>dealer</b> <b>option</b> that was ordered by the new car dealership (or could be ordered privately if you already owned the car) just like rustproofing or custom pinstriping could be ordered for a car by the dealership. As far as a car manufacturer was concerned, as long as the car was converted in a way that did not negatively compromise the car to cause warranty problems, then the new car dealership could do, or have done, whatever they wanted to do. These conversions are not considered OEM or factory options. Conversions done before the final sale to the consumer, for/by the new car dealership are considered dealer options.
