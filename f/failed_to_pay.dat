5|$|All {{five seasons}} of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show {{yielding}} roughly $33 {{million a year}} in revenue, other states courted the production company after the state of Texas <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers of other states, and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Argentine austral {{replaced}} the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as ﬁscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again {{falling out of}} compliance with an IMF programme. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.|$|E

5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E

5|$|John's counter-offensive stalled at {{the siege}} of Wesenberg in 1574, when German and Scottish units of the Swedish army turned against each other. This failure has also been blamed on the {{difficulties}} of fighting in the bitter winter conditions, particularly for the infantry. The war in Livonia was a great financial burden for Sweden, {{and by the end}} of 1573, Sweden's German mercenaries were owed 200,000 daler. John gave them the castles of Hapsal, Leal and Lode as security, but when he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> they were sold to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|This {{process was}} {{temporarily}} halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims. Following a judicial {{decision by the}} Ontario Divisional Court on November 7, 2005, the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407ETR users who have <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> owed fees. On November 22, 2005, the MTO {{announced that it would}} appeal the decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided. On February 24, 2006, the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to appeal the 2005 decision. As a result, plate denial remains in place.|$|E
5|$|To {{secure the}} payment of the arrears, the bishop applied ecclesiastic penalties, placing whole villages under interdict in summer 1436. He also excommunicated the petty noblemen who had refused to pay the tithe. However, most serfs {{resisted}} and their lords were unwilling to assist the bishop. At the bishop's request, the king ordered the voivode and the ispáns (or heads) of the counties to secure {{the collection of the}} tithe in early September. The king also decreed that all peasants who <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the arrears within a month after their excommunication were to pay twelve golden florins as a penalty.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is not a}} crime <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a debt.

But if one <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a debt, they have broken a contract or agreement between them and a creditor. Generally, most oral and written agreements for the repayment of consumer debt - debts for personal, family or household purposes secured primarily by a person's residence - are enforceable.|$|R

Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
5|$|Judy Garland's {{four-year}} {{contract for}} the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 per episode. Of that Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 {{that she would never}} do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Smith {{had signed a}} four-year deal with Premier League club Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1.8m. He later admitted that he was close to signing for Championship side Reading but chose Portsmouth instead. On 30 August 2009, Smith made his Portsmouth debut in a 1–0 defeat to Manchester City at Fratton Park. Portsmouth <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their player's wages on time on three occasions in the 2009–10 season, and Smith was among a number of Portsmouth players linked with a transfer during the January 2010 transfer window. However, due to his five games for Watford, he would have been ineligible to play for another club during the 2009–10 season.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, now that they were no longer fighting each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} began as Zolciak {{was in the}} middle of her first {{pregnancy}} by her boyfriend Biermann; she later gave birth to their son. Leakes continued divorce proceedings with Gregg, while Whitfield found herself in financial difficulties after her ex-husband <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> child support. Meanwhile, Bailey opened her own modeling agency, while Parks looked to launch a family-operated funeral home. Leakes's new friendship with Hampton caused tension between all of the women, which escalated during a group vacation in South Africa; while Zolciak, who had remained home with her children, became upset by negative comments Bailey (not Burruss) made about her during the group vacation. As the season closed, Leakes began to reconsider her divorce from Gregg.|$|E
5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in}} a high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning. The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted to do well in the election.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} costs of his lifestyle, Davidson needed more money than his Stiffkey living could provide. He sought to improve his {{financial}} position when, in about 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, supposedly a wealthy American company promoter but in reality an undischarged bankrupt and confidence trickster. Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his savings {{in a range of}} dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors. Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties. In February that year he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his local rates and was threatened with imprisonment. He avoided this by borrowing from moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates, but in October was forced to file a petition of bankruptcy with debts totalling £2,924. Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was applied to the reduction of his debts. Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life. He never stopped believing in Gordon's essential honesty, and was certain that one day his investments would pay off. Much of his time in London was spent, not in pursuit of girls, but looking for Gordon.|$|E
5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation among this crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they roll the dice again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the £10,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E
