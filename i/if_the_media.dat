5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{are called}} to {{investigate}} {{the shooting death of}} Charles Courtland Cox, a small-time drug peddler shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse. When Pembleton suspects a police shooting, Lt. Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) explains Officer Hellriegel (Jeffrey Mandon) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon. However, Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton. Gee is angry with Pembleton's inquiries into the police, and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) and Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) say they will make Hellriegel a scapegoat <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> start suggesting racism or police brutality. Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun, but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested. Gee refuses to approve the tests, but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them.|$|E

An angry Thơ shouted at the writers and banged his first on the table, assailing them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ claimed the media were lying in saying {{that he and his}} civilian cabinet were puppets of the generals, and claimed that one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would [...] "take steps to meet the situation" [...] <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> did not behave responsibly. Having already had his Information Minister, General Đỗ Mậu, circulate a list of topics that were not to be reported on, Thơ had Mậu close down three newspapers for [...] "disloyalty" [...] on the following day.|$|E

[...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E

They also questioned Thơ's activities under Diệm's presidency, accusing him of personally benefiting from corruption under Diệm's land policy. Mậu's ministry had already circulated {{a long list of}} topics which could not be reported. Thơ could no longer tolerate what was being reported about him. He called journalists into his office and assailed them for what he regarded as inaccurate, irresponsible and disloyal reporting. Thơ accused them of lying, and claimed one of the journalists was a communist while another was a drug addict. He said that his administration would [...] "take steps to meet the situation" [...] <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> did not behave responsibly.

2500|$|... 18 February – Leopoldo López {{delivered}} {{a speech in}} Plaza Brión where {{he pointed out that}} its necessary to build [...] "a pacific exit, inside the constitution but in the streets" [...] and assured that [...] "there isn't free media anymore to express themselves and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> stays silent they must go to the streets". He declared that [...] "if his imprisonment allows Venezuela to wake up definitely and for the Venezuelans that want a change, his imprisonment will be worth it." [...] He turned himself to the National Guard at 12:24 P.M., Venezuelan time, and said he was turning himself to a [...] "corrupt justice". After Lopez turned himself in, the opposition protestors blocked the Francisco Fajardo Highway. Hundreds of his supporters gathered outside the Palacio de Justicia, protesting the fact that in their view Lopez will be judged by an unfair and corrupt justice system in a country where [...] "there is no separation of powers". The opposition protestors were attacked outside the Palacio de Justicia by armed pro-government groups who beat them, threw objects at them from the building and tried to steal their cellphones. Amnesty International said the charges appeared to be politically motivated, and called for the release of López in the absence of evidence. Human Rights Watch said [...] "The Venezuelan government has openly embraced the classic tactics of an authoritarian regime, jailing its opponents, muzzling the media, and intimidating civil society", saying that the Maduro government was blaming opposition leaders, including López, for violence. Some students and professors are arrested for allegedly setting fire to a PDVSA oil truck. Student protestors said they were forcibly removed by police from where they were concentrated for seven days in Maracay. Government supporters gather in Plaza Venezuela.|$|E
2500|$|Between November 1945 and May 1946, {{approximately}} ten courts-martial {{were held}} in public at the Red Fort in Delhi. Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British-Indian army, hoped that by holding public trials in the Red Fort, public opinion would turn against the INA <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> reported stories of torture and collaborationsim, helping him settle a {{political as well as}} military question. Those to stand trials were accused variously of murder, torture and [...] "waging war against the King-Emperor". However, the first and most celebrated joint courts-martial– those of Prem Sahgal, Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan– were not the story of torture and murder Auchinleck had hoped to tell the Indian press and people. The accusations against them included alleged murder of their comrades-in-arms in the INA whilst in Burma. Peter Fay highlights in his book The Forgotten Army that the murders alleged were in fact courts-martial of captured deserters the defendents had presided over. If it was accepted that the three were part of a genuine combatant army (as the legal defence team later argued), they had followed due process of written INA law and of the normal process of conduct of war in execution of the sentences. Indians rapidly came to view the soldiers who enlisted as patriots and not enemy-collaborators. Philip Mason, then Secretary of the War Department, later wrote that [...] "in a matter of weeks... in a wave of nationalist emotion, the INA were acclaimed heroes who fought for the freedom of India." [...] The three accused were from the three major religions of India: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Indians felt the INA represented a true, secular, national army when judged against the British-Indian Army, where caste and religious differences were preserved amongst ranks. The opening of the first trial saw violence and a series of riots in a scale later described as [...] "sensational". The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League both made the release of the INA prisoners an important political issue during the campaign for independence in 1945–1946. Lahore in Diwali 1946 remained dark as the traditional earthen lamps lit on Diwali were not lit by families in support of prisoners. In addition to civilian campaigns of non-cooperation and non-violent protest, protest spread to include mutinies within the British-Indian Army and sympathy within the British-Indian forces. Support for the INA crossed communal barriers {{to the extent that it}} was the last major campaign in which the Congress and the Muslim League aligned together; the Congress tricolour and the green flag of the League were flown together at protests.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{although}} {{every country}} {{of the world has}} its own local <b>media,</b> <b>the</b> local <b>media,</b> such as radio, television, newspapers, etc., rarely differ from international media on points of view.
