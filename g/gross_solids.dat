40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Solids {{movement}} in large-particle fluidized beds was studied in an 18 in x 18 in (46 cm x 46 cm) tube-filled, cold fluidized bed test facility. Direct measurement of local solid mass flux in two dimensions at various locations inside {{the bed was}} made possible by a new instrument developed in this study. This instrument can be installed {{as a part of the}} bed internal tube array and hence does not interfere with the solid flow field being measured. The instrument makes use of the magnetic property of solid and requires a bed media consisting entirely of magnetic solid particles. Iron particles with a mean particle diameter of 0. 032 in (0. 8 mm) and a density of 387 lb/ft³ (6200 kg/m³) were used. Experiments were conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with air as the fluidizing gas. Two gas velocities above the minimum fluidization velocity were used. The net local solid movement and the <b>gross</b> <b>solid</b> circulation pattern inside the bed were deduced from the vertical and one horizontal component of the local solid mass fluxes measured at various locations inside the bed. Two specific solid flow regions were found to exist. The net solids {{movement in}} the middle bubbling region of the bed was in the upward direction while adjacent to the bed walls the net solid movement was downward. The net lateral solid movement was not significant in the bubbling region of the bed. However, at the bottom of the bed this movement can be significantly enhanced by means of an uneven gas velocity distribution inside the bed. A theoretical model for the <b>gross</b> <b>solid</b> circulation observed in a freely bubbling fluidized bed is proposed. The theory is based on material and momentum balances of the net solid circulating flow inside the bed with the assumption that the solid particulate phase behaves as an incompressible fluid of low viscosity. The model predictions for the vertical solid mass flux in the bubbling region of the bed show a reasonable agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gross</b> <b>solids</b> are {{typically}} not considered in monitoring {{studies that have}} quantified pollutant removal efficiencies for stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs). Yet these pollutants degrade aquatic habitat, cause visual blight, smother productive sediments, leach harmful pollutants, and can cause unpleasant odors. Gross pollutants generally consist of litter, debris, and coarse sediments. Litter includes human derived trash, such as paper, plastic, Styrofoam, metal, and glass. Debris consists of organic material including leaves, branches, seeds, twigs and grass clippings. Coarse sediments are inorganic breakdown products from soils, pavement or building materials. In response to growing concerns about <b>gross</b> <b>solids</b> in urban areas, manufacturers have developed a number of proprietary products designed to trap and separate this trash from the runoff flow path before discharge. Most of these BMPs are still in their early implementation stages and have not been fully tested in the field.

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} and {{factors contributing to}} normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for <b>gross</b> continence of <b>solid</b> stool. The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of {{the last part of}} the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these {{mechanisms and}} factors may be involved in the cause.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to various European environmental legislative drivers — which include urban wastewater treatment, fresh-water quality standards for protection {{of fish and}} water framework directives — U. K. water companies have embarked on a new asset management plan. Part of this plan requires the treatment of significantly greater amounts of wastewater, either by building new treatment plants or by increasing flows through existing plants or works. At the same time, many sites face additional tighter constraints for effluent discharge. The majority of wastewater is treated in modern, large-capacity activated sludge process (ASP) plants. Water companies have been making increased use of analytical process modeling tools, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), to find capital cost savings, achieve performance improvements and improve energy savings for these plants. A modern wastewater ASP includes several operational stages that may be modeled with CFD. However, using CFD to investigate these unit operations successfully requires some process knowledge. This article illustrates {{a few of the}} processes and explains how they are best addressed with ANSYS CFX software and multiphase modeling techniques. The basic sequence of operations at a wastewater treatment site with an ASP plant includes the following stages: ■ Inlet works with de-gritting and flow balancing ■ Primary settlement ■ Activated sludge treatment in aeration lanes ■ Secondary settlement ■ Tertiary treatment Inlet Works In most U. K. works, the wastewater enters from an upstream combined sewer system. This wastewater is a mixture of rain water and sewage loaded with solid particles of irregular size, shape and density.

40|$|The {{poor quality}} of many {{receiving}} waters has {{been attributed to}} the frequent operation of combined sewer overflows (C. S. O. s). As the existing need for overflow structures is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future it is imperative that these deleterious effects are minimised. The present study investigates the pollution performance of three common overflow structure designs (the stilling pond, the double high side weir and the double low side weir) and aims to institute a novel pollution monitoring methodology for combined sewer overflows. Four sites in the central Sheffield area were monitored for periods from 9 to 13 months (two high-side weirs, one low-side weir and a stilling pond). Each overflow was monitored with continuous flow measurement equipment and bottle samplers to obtain samples of sewage from the storm and dry weather flows. The bottle samples were analysed for suspended solids (SS), ash, BOD, COD, pH, conductivity and ammonia. Mesh bags and frames were also installed to trap the <b>gross</b> <b>solids</b> (solids with a median size> 6 mm) from the inflow and the spill flow. The stilling pond and the high side weirs were found to perform well hydraulically, limiting the flow to treatment to a steady maximum. The low side weir performed unsatisfactorily, hydraulically, as the flow to treatment rose as the incoming flow increased and, for some storm conditions, a hydraulic jump formed towards the downstream end of the chamber. The first foul flush was regularly observed at the stilling pond and low side weir sites. Peak concentrations for SS were found to be 600 times greater than the dry weather flow for the same time of day. The first foul flush was rarely observed at the other sites. For the majority of storms at each site the spill concentrations were of a similar magnitude to the inflow sample concentrations. However for a large minority of SS, BOD and COD samples, the concentrations of the spill samples were significantly less than the inflow samples. t-Tests suggested that at the stilling pond and high side weir sites there is a significant reduction in the spill sample concentrations for the water quality (bottle) samples. Although the load of material spilled during an overflow event was found to be small in comparison to the inflow load, large amounts of material were spilled to the watercourse during storm events at each of the sites investigated. The storm load entering the CSO was found to be considerably influenced by peak intensity of the storm at the stilling pond site and antecedent dry weather period at one of the high side weir sites. At the other sites a number of hydrological factors were found to be influential e. g. duration. It is thought that time of year may also be important factor as this influences the type of rainfall (its duration and intensity). The types of gross solid collected at each site were similar with leaf material and sanitary towels consistently being the major items in terms of total mass. The efficiency of the stilling pond and one of the high side weirs in retaining <b>gross</b> <b>solids</b> in the flow to treatment appeared to be explained by the flow split although for 5 of 14 storms at the stilling pond and 3 of 7 at the high side weir a treatment effect was observed. The treatment factors at the low side weir were noticeably less than those for the other three sites with all being less than unity (average 0. 5). This suggests that the low side weir preferentially discharges gross solid material over the weir. The treatment factors at the other high side weir were low due to inadequate sampling of the spill flow. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sediments in {{combined}} systems (CS) {{significantly increase}} loads emitting via combined sewer overflows. In future prognosticated {{changes in the}} storm water characteristics, decreasing popu-lation or water conservation will probably worsen these effects. Various actions can prevent the formation of large quantities of sediments whose amounts change considerably over time and space within the sewer. Information about the whereabouts of deposit {{can be obtained by}} visual inspection or mathematical modeling. Both approaches require large efforts. Furthermore, presently available deterministic sewer-quality models with sediment transport were found to be over-parameterized and inherit large uncertainties. Mathematical models as the semi-stochastic sediment transport model are still able to efficiently identify areas with risk of sedimentation. This category of models does not use a single parameter set obtained from calibrating the quality model but varies these parameters instead stochastically within a Monte-Carlo Simulation. The investigation aimed (1) to model the amount of mobile sediments that effect the load distribution during wet weather flow and (2) to quantify the areas with risk of sedimentation within a combined sewerage. A detailed field study showed that readily erodible sediments are most important pollutant based process affecting the load distribution during wet weather flow. Based on this finding, a structured hydrological-stochastic sewer quality model was developed. The simplified conceptual model represents the whole sewer system including the pipes with small cross-sections (less than or equal to DN 300) because in small CS the corresponding part amounts to more than 50 % of the total length. The simulations’ results were compared against field data. The results demonstrate validity of the approach. The investigation showed in particular:(1) The simulated total length of sewers with risk of sedimentation of 2 ’ 998 m agrees well with monitoring data of 3 ’ 121 m. (2) The submodel referring to the transport of <b>gross</b> <b>solids</b> effectively reproduce the deposit observed in reaches with intermittent flow.

40|$|Gas-solid {{fluidized}} bed reactors find many {{applications in the}} energy, chemical and biomedical industries because of their high heat and mass transfer. Their design and optimization {{continue to be a}} challenge; the dependence of mixing dynamics on operating conditions and the impact of the reactor scale are poorly understood. This is compounded by severe limitations on diagnostics in their harsh operating environment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will play a pivotal role in advancing this technology since it enables unrestricted access inside the reactor, enhancing fundamental understanding of several coupled phenomena and their interactions at various scales. The thesis is focused on the bubbling fluidization of Geldart B particles (typically 103 <Ar< 105 and 100 <Re< 102) for application to biomass gasification reactors. 3 D CFD simulations are conducted using the Two-Fluid framework, representing the solids phase as a continuum and optimally balancing fidelity and computational needs. To ensure accuracy, critical submodels accounting for unresolved particle-scale interactions (solids stress tensor, particle-gas drag force and particle-wall slip condition) are identified, and computational efficiency gains are achieved through optimal choice of coordinate system, domain discretization and grid resolution. The modeling framework is validated by comparing predictions with experimental measurements spanning a wide range of operating conditions and diagnostic techniques. We performed some of the first fine-grid 3 D simulations of intermediate sized beds (30 - 70 cm diameter) and identified bubbling dynamics and solids circulation as key metrics for characterizing the fluidization hydrodynamics accurately. Towards this end, we developed Multiphase-flow Statistics using 3 D Detection and Tracking Algorithm (MS 3 DATA) to detect and track bubbles using time and spatially resolved data. Our tools are employed to quantify the effect of reactor size on fluidization hydrodynamics. Under similar operating conditions, significantly larger bubbles are observed in small lab-scale beds (~ 10 - 15 cm diameter) because of flow confinement. However, the mechanism for bubble coalescence and growth is consistent across reactor scales: small bubbles are formed near the gas distributor, coalesce and rise laterally towards the bed center forming slugs. The transition to slugging also marks a shift in the dominant solids circulation pattern and is dependent on the bed geometry and excess gas velocity. The analysis conclusively demonstrates that (a) the hydrodynamics are independent of walls only when bubbles are much smaller than reactor dimensions and (b) within the regime of interest, a 50 cm diameter pilot reactor is representative of larger scales. Mixing dynamics are quantified by examining the gas and solids flow-field in and around bubbles. Bubble rise velocity is proportional to the square root of its diameter, while gas flow sufficiently far (~ 30 particle diameters) depends only on the particle properties. Meanwhile, voidage distribution in the vicinity of bubbles results in higher local permeability to gas flow causing (a) preferential bubble pathways, as bubbles are propelled towards areas already frequented by bubbles and (b) gas bypass or throughflow, as low resistance networks are created for interstitial dense-phase gas. Under typical bubbling conditions of Geldart B particles, throughflow almost short circuits through the reactor (residence time is 2 - 3 x shorter than global average) and can reach 30 - 40 % of the total gas flow with detrimental effects on solids mixing and fuel conversion. A predictive model, based on the local bubble-induced micromixing driven by solids upflow around the bubble nose and wake regions and downflow along its sides, has been developed for scaling the <b>gross</b> <b>solids</b> circulation by integrating over the bubble size and spatial distribution. Moreover, reduced models coupling mixing rates (from simulations) and gasification kinetics have been developed and used to analyze thermochemical conversion of biomass. Our CFD approach will be employed for reactive particulate systems in complex reactor geometry, while utilizing discrete element methods to further the fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics-chemical kinetics coupling, and develop submodels for the continuum framework applications. by Akhilesh Bakshi.
