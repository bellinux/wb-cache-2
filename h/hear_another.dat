500|$|On February 23, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled Wrath {{and one day}} later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to <b>hear</b> <b>another</b> band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it." [...] "Wrath" [...] debuted on the Billboard 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.|$|E
500|$|Barney Hoskyns {{describes}} [...] "Heylin's objections [...] {{the academic}} ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained {{some of the}} greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." [...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>another</b> Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{investor}} conference in November 2010 Hasbro confirmed that {{a sequel to}} the 2010 game Transformers: War for Cybertron would be developed. Transformers: Fall of Cybertron was officially announced on October 6, 2011, in an article posted on the gaming magazine Game Informers website. In the article, Game Informer noted that their November issue would contain an exclusive feature on the upcoming game and the cover would include concept art. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira wrote that fans would be excited to <b>hear</b> <b>another</b> original Transformers game from High Moon Studios was being developed, since the [...] based on the film [...] did not meet critical expectations. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar was also pleased to see an original game being developed and said [...] "we're glad [...] developer High Moon Studios is back to what it does best: crafting new/old adventures for the Autobots and Decepticons". High Moon Studios originally announced {{that they would not}} be releasing Fall of Cybertron on the Microsoft Windows platform but changed their plans. The Windows version was completed by Mercenary Technologies, while High Moon Studios handled the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 releases. The game is powered by Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 and utilizes the Havok physics engine.|$|E

500|$|On Phật Đản, {{thousands}} of Buddhists defied {{the ban on}} flag flying. More than 500 people marched across the Perfume River, carrying signs and placards, congregating at the Từ Đàm Pagoda before a 3,000-strong demonstration, calling for religious equality, {{took place in the}} city centre as government security officials surrounded the area with armoured personnel carriers and civil guardsmen. The signs were in both Vietnamese and English to convey the message to western observers. Despite the ban on religious flags, Vatican flags hoisted on the bridge from the Catholic celebration were never taken down. The leading Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang addressed the crowd and exhorted them to rise up against Catholic discrimination against Buddhism. [...] He called the Buddhists to congregate outside the government radio station in the evening for a rally. Tension increased throughout the day with demonstrators chanting and displaying anti-government slogans as the crowd grew. They expected to <b>hear</b> <b>another</b> speech from Thích Trí Quang, but the speech was withdrawn from broadcast by the government censor. The Armed Forces were called in to disperse the discontented crowd. After two explosions shook the ground, the crowd thought that the troops had resorted to using bombs. Major Sy reportedly fired into the air and his men responded by launching grenades into the crowd as fire hoses were unleashed on the demonstrators. His troops fired directly into the crowd. In the end nine were killed and four severely injured. Two of the dead, both children, had been crushed underneath armored personnel carriers. Some people of nine had been mutilated and decapitated.|$|E

2500|$|Dev's electro {{style and}} [...] "sing-talk" [...] vocal style have been {{compared}} to fellow pop singer Kesha. Dev responded to this, saying, [...] "I'm confident enough in what I do that people will see me for who I am ... I get why people compare us but once people see me live they won't connect us as much." [...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to <b>hear</b> <b>another</b> reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} {{supporting}} witnesses, Brehm {{stated that he}} distinctly remembered <b>hearing</b> <b>another</b> separate shot after the shot which wounded the President's head.

5000|$|At {{the same}} Senate <b>hearing</b> <b>another</b> individual, Terry Mayo, also testified.

60|$|He {{was no good}} in discussion, {{not because}} any amount of {{argument}} could shake his faith, but because the mere fact of <b>hearing</b> <b>another</b> voice disconcerted him painfully, confusing his thoughts at once—these thoughts that for so many years, in a mental solitude more barren than a waterless desert, no living voice had ever combatted, commented, or approved.|$|R
60|$|The speaker having covered himself, {{the band}} again formed {{and passed the}} window of Sidonia's hotel, {{followed}} by a stream of idle amateurs, animated by the martial strain, and attracted by the pleasure of <b>hearing</b> <b>another</b> fine performance at the next quarter of the town, where the Baroni family might halt to announce the impending amusements of the evening.|$|R

50|$|At an April 13 <b>hearing,</b> <b>another</b> {{request for}} {{dismissal}} of charges was denied.

Wally stands {{for a moment on}} the edge of the precipice before hurling herself down to her death.|$|R
6000|$|... "At a {{distance}} he <b>hears</b> <b>another,</b> perhaps utterly unknown to him.
