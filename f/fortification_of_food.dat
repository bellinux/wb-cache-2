40|$|Folate has {{received}} international attention regarding {{its role in}} the risk-reduction of birth defects, specifically neural tube defects (NTDs). In 1998, health officials in Canada, like the United States, mandated the addition of folic acid to white flour and select grain products to increase the folate intake of reproductive-aged women. Subsequent to this initiative there has been an increase in blood folate concentrations in Canada and a 50 % reduction in NTDs. Many countries, including Korea, have not mandated folic acid <b>fortification</b> <b>of</b> their <b>food</b> supply. Reasons vary but often include concern over the masking of vitamin B 12 deficiency, a belief that folate intakes among womenare adequate, low priority relative to other domestic issues, and the philosophy that individuals have the right not to consume supplemental folic acid if they so choose. Prior to folic acid <b>fortification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> supply in Canada, the folate intakes of women were low, and their blood folate concentrations while not sufficiently low to produce overt signs of folate deficiency (eg. anemia) were inconsistent with a level known {{to reduce the risk of}} an NTD-affected pregnancy.

Failure to include iron-rich foods in the diet and inappropriate dietary intake coupled with wide variation in bioavailability (based on the presence of iron absorption inhibitors in the diet) are some of the important factors responsible for iron deficiency.
