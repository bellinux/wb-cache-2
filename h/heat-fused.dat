2500|$|Spool {{tension on}} most modern baitcasting reels can be {{adjusted}} with adjustable spool tension, a centrifugal brake, or a magnetic [...] "cast control." [...] This reduces spool overrun during a cast and the resultant line snare, known as backlash, colloquially called a [...] "bird's nest" [...] or [...] "birdie". This backlash {{is a result of}} the angular momentum of the spool and line which is not present with a fixed spool or spinning reel. [...] Each time a lure of a different weight is attached, the cast control must be adjusted for the difference in weight. [...] The bait casting reel design will operate well with a wide variety of fishing lines, ranging from braided multifilament and <b>heat-fused</b> [...] "superlines" [...] to copolymer, fluorocarbon, and nylon monofilaments (see Fishing line). [...] Most bait casting reels can also easily be palmed or thumbed to increase the drag, set the hook, or to accurately halt the lure at a given point in the cast.|$|E
2500|$|Roughly {{half of the}} world's {{polyvinyl}} chloride resin manufactured annually is used for producing pipes for municipal and industrial applications.

Buried PVC pipes in both water and sanitary sewer applications that are [...] in diameter and larger are typically joined by means of a gasket-sealed joint. [...] The most common type of gasket utilized in North America is a metal reinforced elastomer, commonly referred to as a Rieber sealing system. Its light weight, low cost, and low maintenance make it attractive. [...] However, it must be carefully installed and bedded to ensure longitudinal cracking and overbelling does not occur. [...] Additionally, PVC pipes can be fused together using various solvent cements, or <b>heat-fused</b> (butt-fusion process, similar to joining HDPE pipe), creating permanent joints that are virtually impervious to leakage.|$|E
50|$|Thermoplastic Membrane - This {{is similar}} to {{synthetic}} rubber, but the seams are typically <b>heat-fused</b> (welded) to form a continuous membrane. The 'lap' seams can also be fused with solvents instead of heat, and can be {{as strong as the}} rest of the membrane. Other related materials are CPA, CPE, EIP, NBP, PIB, and TPO. Thermoplastic membranes include a reinforcement layer that provides more strength and stability. The most common thermoplastic membranes are PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin).|$|E
50|$|The {{area near}} the head of Austfjord (today called Sondre Igaliku) further north was also an {{important}} hub in Vatnahverfi, presumably due to its close proximity and easy access by foot or boat to Gardar about 15 km to the northwest, where the colony's bishopric and Althing parliament were located. As with Hafgrimsfjord {{there was a small}} church in Austfjord, called Undir Hofdi. A lump of <b>heat-fused</b> clay and glass found in the ruins of the church suggests that it was burnt at some point, as was possibly the case with larger churches in Brattahlid, Gardar, and Herjolfsnes.|$|E
50|$|The {{campus of}} Belmont Abbey has been {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places as an Historic District since 1973. The Abbey Basilica of Mary Help of Christians is the central feature of the campus. Built in the German Gothic Revival {{architectural}} style, the basilica was the largest Catholic church in North Carolina {{at the time of}} its construction. The monks of Belmont Abbey did much of the construction work themselves. The original art glass windows of the Basilica were designed and executed by the Royal Bavarian Establishment of Francis Mayer and Company of Munich, Germany. They were painted then <b>heat-fused,</b> allowing for greater detail than was possible with stained glass. The windows were part of a display that won four gold medals at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1892. The Basilica held cathedral rank from 1910 to 1977. It was elevated to the rank of a Minor Basilica on July 27, 1998.|$|E

50|$|The {{daguerreotype}} {{image is}} formed on a highly polished silver surface. Usually the silver {{is a thin}} layer on a copper substrate, but other metals such as brass {{can be used for}} the substrate and daguerreotypes can also be made on solid silver sheets. A surface of very pure silver is preferable, but sterling (92.5% pure) or US coin (90% pure) or even lower grades of silver are functional. In 19th century practice, the usual stock material, Sheffield plate, was produced by a process sometimes called plating by fusion. A sheet of sterling silver was <b>heat-fused</b> onto the top of a thick copper ingot. When the ingot was repeatedly rolled under pressure to produce thin sheets, the relative thicknesses of the two layers of metal remained constant. The alternative was to electroplate a layer of pure silver onto a bare copper sheet. The two technologies were sometimes combined, the Sheffield plate being given a finishing coat of pure silver by electroplating.|$|E
