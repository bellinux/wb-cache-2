25|$|Several <b>desirable</b> <b>control</b> {{methods are}} {{currently}} ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E

Superior features of PSO method are fast tuning of the parameters, rapid convergence, less computational burden and capability to avoid from local optima.

40|$|Proladin, {{a hormone}} {{indispensable}} for milk secretion, {{has been shown}} to enhance the development and growth of mammary tumors in rodents; however, its importance in human breast cancer is uncertain. Serum prolactin levels are known to fluduate considerably under normal conditions, and lack of precision in the hormone measurements {{may have contributed to the}} largely negative findings in humans to date. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of prolactin measurements in women using stored serum from an ongoing prospedive study of breast cancer. Separate groups of postmenopausal and premenopausal women who donated multiple blood samples at approximately 1 -year intervals were studied. The reliability of a single log proladin determination, as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, was 0. 76 for the postmenopausal women (95 % confidence interval, 0. 66 - 0. 85) and 0. 48 for the premenopausal women (95 % confidence interval, 0. 31 - 0. 62). These findings suggest that a single measurement is sufficient to characterize the serum prolactin level of postmenopausal women for epidemiological research. For premenopausal women, however, multiple samples are <b>desirable.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for phase of the menstrual cycle does not appear to substantially improve the reliability of premenopausal measurements...|$|R
