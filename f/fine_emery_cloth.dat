50|$|Scary sharp is {{a method}} of {{sharpening}} woodworking tools with sandpaper instead of conventional methods of oilstone or waterstone sharpening. The sandpaper referred to here can be any abrasive impregnated sheet used in the various industries to smooth surfaces and examples include glass paper, silicon carbide, <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> etc. The sandpaper is affixed to another hard, flat substrate to create the sharpening surface. Sheet-glass is commonly used, but a machinist's granite surfacing block, marble baking slabs, plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or even jointer out-feed tables will produce satisfactory results. The method of fixation is usually {{a matter of the}} user's preference, and can include plain water (by means of surface tension), sprayed-on adhesive, or by simply using adhesive-backed abrasive paper. This is exactly the same method as that used by materials scientists in preparing polished samples for metallography.|$|R

50|$|A rock-section {{should be}} about one-thousandth of an inch (30 micrometres) in thickness, and is {{relatively}} easy to make. A thin splinter of the rock, about 1 centimetre may be taken; it should be as fresh as possible and free from obvious cracks. By grinding it on a plate of planed steel or cast iron with a little fine carborundum it is soon rendered flat on one side and is then transferred to a sheet of plate glass and smoothed with the very <b>finest</b> <b>emery</b> till all minute pits and roughnesses are removed and the surface is a uniform plane. The rock-chip is then washed, and placed on a copper or iron plate which is heated by a spirit or gas lamp. A microscopic glass slip is also warmed on this plate with a drop of viscous natural Canada balsam on its surface. The more volatile ingredients of the balsam are dispelled by the heat, and when that is accomplished the smooth, dry, warm rock is pressed firmly into contact with the glass plate so that the film of balsam intervening may be as thin as possible and free from air-bubbles. The preparation is allowed to cool and then the rock chip is again ground down as before, first with carborundum and, when it becomes transparent, with <b>fine</b> <b>emery</b> till the desired thickness is obtained. It is then cleaned, again heated with a little more balsam, and covered with a cover glass. The labor of grinding the first surface may be avoided by cutting off a smooth slice with an iron disk armed with crushed diamond powder. A second application of the slitter after the first face is smoothed and cemented to the glass will in expert hands leave a rock-section so thin as to be already transparent. In this way the preparation of a section may require only twenty minutes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the relationships among}} the chemical composition, microstructure and properties (hardness, micro-hardness, wear resistance) of powder additives based on NiCrBSi after their deposition. Tested materials reached a relatively wide range of hardness after deposition, which corresponds to their chemical composition and microstructure. The abrasive wear resistance of materials was tested on an <b>emery</b> <b>cloth.</b> The results indicate that both the hardness and abrasive wear resistance of tested materials depend especially {{on the content of}} carbon and chromium. Microstructural analysis indicates that the structure of tested materials is formed by the Î³-Ni solid solution and intermediate phases based on boron, silicon and carbon. Those mostly form eutectics (three types), or are excluded by precipitation. There was also found a significant effect of chromium, but especially carbon content on the ratio between the solid solution and eutectics in the microstructure of tested materials. These different ratios of solid solution and eutectics were markedly reflected in micro-hardness behaviours in deposited layers. Micro-hardness values confirmed also the presence of carbidic particles in the layers with carbon content higher than 0. 7 wt%...|$|R

The whole mixture is then poured into a funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off and the ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with <b>fine</b> <b>emery</b> and spirits of wine. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to study the influence of surface roughness on transitions between the subcritical, critical supercritical and postcritical regimes around isolated circular cylinders in cross-flow. The experiments were performed in an open-jet wind tunnel, which was modified to obtain satisfactorily bidimensional conditions, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 2. 6 Ã— 10 ^ 4 to 2. 8 Ã— 10 ^ 5. The cylinders were covered with different types of standard commercial <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> and the estimated relative roughness varied from 1. 0 Ã— 10 ^- 3 to 12 Ã— 10 ^- 3. The signal from a hot-wire probe placed near the cylinder was analysed in order to ascertain the presence of vortex shedding and to obtain the Strouhal number. The mean pressure distribution around most of the cylinders were also measured, and then the drag coefficients were obtained by integration. The boundaries between the various flow regimes {{as a function of the}} degree of roughness and of the Reynolds number were tentatively established, assuming the critical regime to be characterised by the absence of regular vortex shedding, and the postcritical one by Reynolds-number independence. The results confirmed the striking influence of roughness on the flow regime; in particular, the critical regime can be impressively reduced, and it may even disappear in the case of highly roughened cylinders. The boundaries between the various regimes, as well as the supercritical and postcritical drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers, seem to be a function of both the size and the type of surface roughness. This is confirmation, therefore, that it is not possible to characterise the flow regime only by means of a Reynolds number based on the size of the roughness. Finally, it was demonstrated that strong supercritical and postcritical vortex shedding can take place from highly, but uniformly, roughened circular cylinders...|$|R

High purity ingredients; Bi 2 O 3 (99 %), Dy 2 O 3 (99.9 %), V 2 O 5 (98.5 %) were taken in a suitable stoichiometry to synthesize all samples. The compositions were mixed thoroughly using mortar and pestle, first in an air atmosphere for 1 Â h and then in methanol for 2 Â h so as to prepare good homogeneous fine powder. Then the fine powders were calcined in a high purity alumina crucible at an optimized temperature of 700 Â Â°C for 3 Â h in an air atmosphere.

40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} in order to study {{the influence of the}} thickness of the boundary layer developing over the lateral surface of an axisymmetric blunt-body upon its base pressure and near-wake flow features. Three different boundary layer thicknesses have been obtained by wrapping strips of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> on the smooth model at a Reynolds number Re= 550000, at which the boundary layer over the lateral surface becomes turbulent before reaching the base contour. Pressure measurements show that the suctions on the base - and thus the pressure drag of the model - are reduced by increasing the boundary layer thickness. This phenomenon can be connected with a reduction of the curvature of the streamlines at the separation point and with a corresponding increase of the length of the mean recirculation region behind the body. The results of the frequency analysis on the pressures acting on the model (obtained from pressure taps) and on the velocity fluctuations (measured through hot-wire anemometry) show a dominating peak, whose frequency decreases by increasing the boundary layer thickness. In non-dimensional terms, a Strouhal number based on the wake width and the velocity defect at a suitable reference cross-section is found to remain almost constant for the different cases. Moreover, a second dominating frequency, connected with the fluctuations of the mean recirculation region, is found in the spectra of the pressure signals around the base centre and in the ones of the velocity signals in the near-wake centreline. Also the Strouhal number associated with this frequency, approximately equal to one third of the previous one, decreases by increasing the boundary layer thickness. In order to better understand the dynamics of the fluid structures present {{in the wake of the}} body, statistical and time-frequency analyses (using the wavelet and Hilbert transforms) are carried out: the detected peak is related to the presence of coherent vortical structures (hairpin vortices) downstream of the main recirculation region behind the body. The hairpin vortices keep a planar symmetry, due to the presence of the faired strut that supports the model...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{paper is}} one of a series {{describing}} work aimed at comparing and eval-uating various standard methods for the mechanical testing of laminated composites. The work is based on test methods specified by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the Composites Research Advisory Group (CRAG). Previous papers [1, 2] describe the use of these methods for testing carbon fibre and glass fibre reinforced plastics composites respectively. The current paper describes the extension of the earlier work to cover "Kevlar " fibre reinforced plastics (KFRP). Tests were made in tension, compression and flexure modes; the standard tests used here evaluated the strength and stiffness of the laminates studied. It was found that although the recommendations of the standards by the three institutes are broadly similar a number of substantial differences arose in the results. 1.

40|$|Up to now zinc-PANI {{batteries}} has {{not been}} commercialized from few main reasons. First reason is degradation process of PANI at potentials more positive than ~ 0. 5 V [1, 2], and second is zinc passivation, which is possibly related {{to the formation of}} the solid phases ZnCl 2 Â· 3 NH 4 Cl and ZnCl 2 Â· 2 NH 4 Cl on the anode surface [3]. On the other hand, in chloride containing electrolytes Zn electrodes form dendrites during chargeâ€“discharge cycles [5]. It results in decreased coulombic efficiency of batteries and charge life. Main reason for that are sort circuit provoked by penetration of dendrites through separator to cathode or formation of the anodic slime. It is well known that some organic anions can form complexes with the metal ions, that results much better quality of the metal deposits and suppress dendrite formation [7]. Probably, the best choice will be oxalic anions, due to the small ionic radius, good PANI doping-dedoping characteristics, etc [8]. Unfortunately, zinc oxalate is an insoluble salt. In this paper we have investigated behavior of zinc and PANI electrodes in chloride containing electrolytes with addition of citrate anions, which at pH~ 5 that can form an soluble zinc citrate [ZnCit] â€“ complex.
