5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine.

He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E

When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

Never had he been so delighted as when, the very evening of their captivity, the musk-oxen, evincing no particular fear of him, began to dig with sharp hoofs into the snow for moss. And they found moss, and ate it, which solved Jones's greatest problem. He had hardly dared to think how to feed them, and here they were picking sustenance out of the frozen snow.|$|R

25|$|Upon its inception, the Indian Army {{inherited}} the British Army's organisational structure, {{which is still}} maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations.

Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{the first}} State of Origin match was played in Australia. This pitted teams {{representative}} of Queensland and New South Wales against each other. Although matches {{between the two}} had taken place for many years, the origin concept (borrowed from Australian rules football) meant {{that for the first}} time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing <b>greater</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are now some of the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.|$|R
