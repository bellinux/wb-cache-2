5|$|Apart from <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> and deliberate, {{targeted}} persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable}} to disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors. Human presence alone can cause the birds to accidentally displace or destroy their eggs, leave hatchlings exposed to predators and adverse weather, or even abandon their colonies completely.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{suffering}} badly from urbanisation, housing development, mining development, {{and expansion of}} agricultural lands. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the grass and overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Forest fires and weeds also contribute to <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Florida panther {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} mammals on earth. About 50 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats to the panther include <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> from human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning.|$|E
50|$|In lower altitudes {{the species}} is {{threatened}} by continuous <b>habitat</b> <b>destructions.</b>|$|R

40|$|The wild flora of Romania {{includes}} {{a lot of}} species presenting decorative value, some of them being already taken in cultivation and other could represent new and important horticultural resources in the future. Numerous species under this category are rare and vulnerable because of their very small growing areas, <b>habitats</b> <b>destruction</b> or collection in commercial uses. The paper presents 31 species from this categories cultivated in “Anastasie Fatu” Botanic Garden of Iaşi. For each species, the biological and ecological particularities {{as well as the}} frequency, endemic character and national, European or global sozological category, are presented...|$|R
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, and skins are {{valuable}} items sold in markets. Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction,</b> entanglement in fishing gear, and watercraft collisions. Steller's sea cow went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.|$|E
5|$|The sarus crane is {{classified}} as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats include <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species. The effects of inbreeding in the Australian population {{may need to be}} studied.|$|E
5|$|The western quoll or chuditch (D. geoffroii) is {{restricted}} to the Jarrah Forest and the central and southern Australian Wheatbelt. The western quoll {{is believed to have}} once occupied 70% of Australia, but because of cane toads, predators, <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction,</b> and poison baiting, it is now less abundant.|$|E

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction.</b> Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Urban sprawl and <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> have {{adversely}} affected Gila monster numbers. In 1952, {{they became the}} first venomous animal to be given legal protection. Gila monsters are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. In 1963, the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo to successfully breed Gila monsters in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Coke's {{hartebeest}} {{is listed}} as Least Concern. This species has been greatly affected by <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction,</b> and about 42,000 Coke's hartebeest occur today in Mara, Serengeti National Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania and Tsavo East National Park in Kenya. The population is decreasing, and 70% of the population lives in protected areas.|$|E
50|$|With this setback, {{the unity}} of the tanuki finally fails and they break up into smaller groups, each {{following}} a different strategy. One group led by Gonta takes the route of eco-terrorism, holding off workers until they are wiped out in a pitched battle with the police. Another group desperately attempts to gain media attention through television appearances to plead their case against the <b>habitat's</b> <b>destruction.</b> One of the elders becomes senile and starts a Buddhist dancing cult among the tanuki who are unable to transform, eventually sailing away with them in a ship that takes them to their deaths, while the other elder investigates joining the human world as the last of the transforming kitsune (foxes) have already done.|$|R
40|$|Protected Areas {{owned and}} managed by private actors are {{expected}} to have a relevant role in nature conservation policy as an additional tool to public-run protected sites. By reducing natural <b>habitats</b> <b>destruction</b> and degradation, well designed and well governed private protected areas (PPAs) can have a key role in tackling two intertwined global threats: biodiversity loss and climate change. In this article we will present PPAs diffusion in Europe basing on data collected from the European Common Database on Nationally Designated Areas. In addition, an assessment framework will be proposed, with the purpose of contributing to a broader understanding of PPAs potentialities and pitfalls. The main challenges for PPAs effectiveness deal with their geographical distribution and their ability to provide strong and stable legal structures for private protection, assuring adequate and inclusive governance...|$|R
50|$|It is {{threatened}} by <b>habitat</b> loss, <b>destruction</b> of its native environment, in particular spawning locations, is leading {{to a decline in}} the number of this species. As with a great variety of Australian frog species, chytridiomycosis poses great threats to the future of this species, with some locales experiencing 28% infection rate.|$|R
5|$|Despite many {{sightings}} and {{a seemingly}} large and diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths caused by humans result from: <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction,</b> farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction,</b> capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is {{the main reason for}} the decline of population.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback sea turtle, are critically endangered. Threats to these species include <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
50|$|Threats to {{this rare}} species include <b>habitat</b> damage and <b>destruction</b> by feral pigs and {{introduced}} plant species. Plants {{may be lost}} in floods, hurricanes, and landslides.|$|R
5000|$|William the Conqueror, a great {{lover of}} hunting, {{established}} {{the system of}} forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest <b>habitat</b> from <b>destruction.</b> In the year of his death, 1087, a poem, [...] "The Rime of King William", inserted in the Peterborough Chronicle, expresses English indignation at the forest laws.|$|R
50|$|There {{appear to}} be no major or {{widespread}} threats to the narrow-nosed Planigale species. Localised threats and population declines occur {{in the form of}} <b>habitat</b> conversion or <b>destruction,</b> particularly for agricultural use.|$|R
5|$|The {{worldwide}} {{population size}} and trends in population numbers {{have not been}} determined, but is it believed that the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not threatened. The species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species despite <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction.</b> It is patchily distributed, but its range {{is large enough to}} sustain it at a Least Concern status.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, there seems to be little <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> in Gabon and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction.</b> A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
50|$|Threats to {{the plant}} include <b>habitat</b> {{degradation}} and <b>destruction</b> by feral pigs and goats and non-native plants such as Ageratina riparia, Erigeron karvinskianus, Grevillea robusta, Melinis minutiflora, Rubus argutus, and Schinus terebinthifolius.|$|R
50|$|From an applied Anthropological approach, the {{biological}} and sociocultural aspects of this ecologically prominent palm species were considered. The {{study found that the}} density of the Manicaria palm was highest in wet, swampy habitat with lower density at all life stages within drier substrate. Thus, this palm thrives in a very specific <b>habitat,</b> and <b>destruction</b> of that <b>habitat</b> by commercial agricultural drainage of wetlands can impact the population negatively.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{identify}} and locate some species related to habitats from Pricop-Huta-Certeze and Upper Tisa Natura 2000 Protected Areas (PHCTS) and {{to determine if they}} are vulnerable to risks induced by maximum flow phases. In the first chapter are mentioned few references about the morphometric parameters of the hydrographic networks within the study area, as well as some references related to the maximum flow phases frequency. After the second chapter, where methods and databases used in the study are described, we proceed to the identification of the areas that are covered by water during flood, as well as determining the risk level related to these areas. The GIS modeling reveals small extent of the flood high risk for natural environment related to protected areas and greater extent for the anthropic environment. The last chapter refers to several species of fish and batrachia, as well as to those amphibious mammals identified in the study area that are vulnerable to floods (high turbidity effect, reduction of dissolved oxygen quantity, <b>habitats</b> <b>destruction</b> etc.) ...|$|R
5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill has not been seen since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of <b>habitat</b> <b>destruction</b> and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E
40|$|The <b>habitats</b> <b>destruction</b> {{linked to}} {{fragmentation}} causes serious consequences for vegetation in general, especially considering the Northeast Atlantic Forest. The Northeastern Swamps of Altitudes are areas with microclimates dissociating from extensions {{where they are}} inserted. Knowledge of the natural regeneration potential {{is the key to}} understanding the dynamics of vegetation. The study aimed to evaluate the recruitment and mortality of Anadenanthera colubrina regenerating occurring in Open Rain Forest fragments. In a population of A.  colubrina, ten plots with 10 m x 10 m were established, near matrices plants. All specimens with 1 m height or lower were numbered and monitored for 9 months. The stem diameter of the taxon showed continuous growth. The monthly average increment in diameter was at first 1. 8 mm and at the end 2. 3 mm, and the average stem increment in height was 20 cm at the first month  and 25. 9 cm at the last month evaluate. The mortality rate reached 50 %. Environmental and anthropogenic factors and seed predation contribute to mortality of regenerating individuals...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are seven}} major {{anthropogenic}} threats to biodiversity: <b>habitat</b> fragmentation, <b>destruction,</b> degradation (including pollution), overexploitation of species for human consumption, disease increases, introduction of invasive species, and global climate change. These {{activities such as}} agricultural expansion, reckless industrialisation and urbanisation, altered the ecosystems and distribution of species. Land use change {{has led to the}} degradation, fragmentation and <b>destruction</b> of <b>habitats,</b> therefore triggered the species movement and loss of biodiversity and species extinctions worldwide.|$|R
