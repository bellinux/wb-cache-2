30|$|A {{spectrophotometric}} assay {{based on the}} color reaction between <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) and 4 -[4 -(dipropylamino)phenylazo]-benzenesulfonic acid (propyl orange) {{was used for the}} determination of DDAC as a wood preservative. The assay was carried out using a propyl orange solution at pH 2.9. The visible absorbance spectrum of propyl orange showed an absorbance maximum at 510 nm, which decreased continuously with increasing DDAC concentration from 0 to 20 ppm. A linear correlation was observed at a DDAC concentration lower than 8 ppm. To apply this assay method to determine DDAC retention in treated wood, the influence of wood extractives on the assay was investigated. Wood extractives from sapwood and heartwood of Japanese cedar, Hinoki cypress, Japanese larch, and Western hemlock showed no influence on DDAC determination except in the case of heartwood from Japanese cedar and Hinoki cypress, which gave apparent DDAC concentrations higher than the actual values. However, it was also found that absorbance measurement at 477 nm solved this overestimation and gave precise values. It was concluded that this assay is a viable alternative to the current methods for DDAC determination.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} dermal {{absorption}} kinetics of <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) was studied after single and multiple exposure. In addition, {{the influence of}} biocidal formulations on the absorption of DDAC was investigated. Following dermal exposure to DDAC in aqueous solution, less than 0. 5 % of the applied dose reached the receptor fluid after 48 h. The apparent permeability coefficient (Kp) was 5 ± 1 cm/h × 10 - 6 for concentrations 11 mg/mL). However, the amount of DDAC reaching the receptor fluid remained low (< 1 % over a 48 h period). Selected biocidal formulations tended to reduce DDAC skin absorption. The degree of reduction appeared to be correlated {{to the amount of}} aldehydes present. Based on the comparison of the distribution of DDAC in full-thickness skin and epidermal membranes, we conclude that approximately one-third of the DDAC measured in the full-thickness membranes resides in the dermis.

40|$|While the {{heartwood}} of many wood species exhibits excellent {{resistance to}} fungal and insect attack, this resistance is sometimes diminished in second-growth material {{of the same}} species. The reasons for the reduced durability are unclear, but they may reflect {{a combination of both}} higher proportions of sapwood as well as reduced levels of heartwood extractives. Second growth timbers are often faster grown and this accelerated growth may affect the production of toxic extractives present in the heartwood. Reduced durability may affect the reputation, quality, and values of the final products. One approach for maintaining the quality of naturally durable second-growth timbers is to supplementarily treat the wood with low concentrations of preservatives.

ADBAC and DDAC exhibited similar MIC behaviors from 0. 4 ppm to 1. 8 ppm over an inoculum range of 1 × 105 to 1 × 109 CFU/ml at 35 °C. For ADBAC and DDAC, an increased rapidity of killing against S. aureus (final concentration, 2 × 109 CFU/ml) {{was observed at}} 35 °C compared to 25 °C. Concentration exponents (η) for killing were < 2. 5 for both agents, and temperature influenced the η value. Examination of leakage and kill data suggested that a single leakage marker was not indicative of cell death. ADBAC and DDAC possessed Langmuir (L 4) and high-affinity (H 3 / 4) uptake isotherms, respectively. ADBAC molecules formed a single monolayer of coverage of cells {{at the end of}} primary uptake, and DDAC formed a double monolayer. Rapid cell leakage occurred at bactericidal concentrations, with total depletion of the intracellular potassium and 260 -nm-absorbing pools released in this strict order.

40|$|Background There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the availability of commercial sporicidal formulations. Any comparison of sporicidal data from the literature is hampered by the number of different standard tests available and the use of diverse test conditions including bacterial strains and endospore preparation. Aim To evaluate the effect of sporicidal standard tests on the apparent activity of eight biocides against Clostridium difficile and Bacillus subtilis. Methods The activity of eight biocidal formulations including two oxidizing agents, two aldehydes, three <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) and amine formulations, and sodium hypochlorite were evaluated using four standard sporicidal tests (BS EN 14347, BS EN 13704, ASTM E 2197 - 11, and AOAC MB- 15 - 03) against B. subtilis (ACTC 19659) and C. difficile (NCTC 11209) spores. Findings C. difficile spores were more susceptible to the sporicides than were B. subtilis spores, regardless of the method used. There were differences in sporicidal activity between methods at 5 min but not at 60 min exposure. DDAC and amine-based products were not sporicidal when neutralized appropriately. Neutralization validation was confirmed for these biocides using the reporting format described in the BS EN standard tests, although the raw data appear to indicate that neutralization failed. Conclusion The different methods, whether based on suspension or carrier tests, produced similar sporicidal inactivation data. This study suggests that detailed neutralization validation data should be reported to ensure that neutralization of active spores is effective. Failure to do so may lead to erroneous sporicidal claims...|$|E

After treatment with 2 % Steranios added to the washer, less than 1 micro-organism/ml liquid was found in the following units: 83 % of the colonoscopes, 83 % of the oesophagogastroduodenoscopes, 83 % of the main channels of the retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopes and 75 % of the auxiliary channels of the latter instruments. In 14 % of the colonoscopes, 42 % of the gastroduodenoscopes, 42 % of the main and 50 % of auxiliary channels in the retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopes there were no signs of microbial growth in the wash liquid. The results obtained indicated that this protocol allowed adequate disinfection of the endoscope channels, structurally {{the most difficult part of}} the instrument to disinfect. Emphasis is given to the degree by which instrument contamination can increase during overnight storage, suggesting that endoscopes need to be submitted to further disinfection after overnight storage. Moreover, the water flowing into the washers can also cause instrument recontamination, particularly during the final rinses. Therefore, to better safeguard the health of patients undergoing endoscopy, special care must be taken to maintain the filters and disinfect the washers themselves, no matter how effective the disinfection protocol used may be.

The outbreak involved 43 patients (10 infected and 33 colonized). DesignWe performed environmental analysis to detect multiresistant E. cloacae for comparison with clinical isolates (genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST as well as ESBL-typing) and determined the MICs of the quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (ADBAC) and <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC). A bleach-based cleaning-disinfection program was implemented in December 2012 after mechanical removal of the biofilm in all sinks. ResultsWe have detected 17 ESBL-producing E. cloacae in patients sink drains, shower drains and medical sink drains. Sequencing of the bla genes performed on 60 strains recovered from patients and environment (n= 43 clinical and n= 17 environmental) revealed that bla CTX-M 15 was predominant (37 isolates) followed by bla CTX-M 9 plus bla SHV- 12 (20 isolates). We observed a great diversity among the isolates: 14 pulsotypes (11 STs) in clinical isolates and 9 pulsotypes (7 STs) in environmental isolates. Six pulsotypes were identical between clinical and environmental isolates. MICs of the quaternary ammonium compounds widely used for disinfection were very high in clinical and environmental isolates. Immediately after the implementation of the disinfection program we noticed a substantial fall in cases number. Our findings demonstrate the role of drains as important reservoir of ESBL-producing E. cloacae and highlight the necessity to settle drains accessible to achieve correct cleaning as well as to use disinfectant with proved activity against nosocomial pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Ballast water-mediated {{transfer}} of aquatic invasive species {{is considered a}} major threat to marine biodiversity, marine industry and human health. A ballast water treatment is needed to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) ballast water discharge regulations. <b>Didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) was tested for its applicability as a ballast water treatment method. The treatment of the marine phytoplankton species Tetraselmis suecica, Isochrysis galbana and Chaetoceros calcitrans showed that at 2. 5 µL L- 1 DDAC was able to inactivate photosystem II (PSII) efficiency and disintegrate the cells after 5 days of dark incubation. The treatment of natural marine plankton communities with 2. 5 µL L- 1 DDAC did not sufficiently decrease zooplankton abundance to comply with the IMO D- 2 standard. Bivalve larvae showed the highest resistance to DDAC. PSII efficiency was inactivated within 5 days but phytoplankton cells remained intact. Regrowth occurred within 2 days of incubation in the light. However, untreated phytoplankton exposed to residual DDAC showed delayed cell growth and reduced PSII efficiency, indicating residual DDAC toxicity. Natural marine plankton communities treated with 5 µL L- 1 DDAC showed sufficient disinfection of zooplankton and inactivation of PSII efficiency. Phytoplankton regrowth was not detected after 9 days of light incubation. Bacteria were initially reduced due to the DDAC treatment but regrowth was observed within 5 days of dark incubation. Residual DDAC remained too high after 5 days to be safely discharged. Two neutralization cycles of 50 mg L- 1 bentonite were needed to inactivate residual DDAC upon discharge.

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of quality controls in food business and during official food surveillance, <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) residues {{in excess of the}} currently applicable MRL of 0. 01 mg/kg were detected in food. DDAC is a quaternary ammonium compound belonging to the group of cationic surfactants. It is used in disinfectants and detergents. DDAC is both a biocide and a pesticide active substance. In addition, DDAC is contained in products used as plant strengtheners. The available data indicate “background” levels of DDAC above the currently applicable default MRL for most commodities. Based on the available data the cause can not always be clearly identified. It is noticed, that for citrus fruit and large tropical fruit, e. g. banana and mango, occasionally especially high residues were reported. It is likely that these fruits received post-harvest treatments with DDAC. Very high residues were also observed for fresh herbs. These residues can be the result of the use of a plant strengthener, which has meanwhile been withdrawn from the market. Disinfection of planting pots or equipment might also have been a source. DDAC residues in milk and ice cream might be due to disinfection of equipment. Based on German and EU consumption data, the BfR estimated the dietary intake of DDAC residues from contaminated food. Neither the ARfD nor the ADI are exceeded. The BfR comes to the conclusion that neither an acute nor a chronic risk for consumers is likely. The BfR considers it as reasonable to raise the MRLs for DDAC to an adequate extent, if the changes are reviewed as soon as more information becomes available from national product authorizations for biocides containing DDAC. Furthermore it is recommended to establish clear guidance on adequate cleaning/washing procedures to be followed after disinfection of equipment that gets in contact with food...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{extensive}} presence of some toxic {{quaternary ammonium compound}} residues in foodstuffs arriving into the EU during 2012, the Food Authority Control of Geneva decided to implement a monitoring plan to investigate {{the presence of these}} contaminants in food: a method based on quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed for analyzing <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and four benzalkonium chloride homologue residues in fruits and vegetables. An in-house method validation, based on the SANCO guidelines (Document SANCO No. 12571 / 2013), was conducted using three independent series in orange, lettuce, and avocado composite samples spiked at three levels (10, 100, 500 μg/kg). Trueness and precision were calculated by pooling all results at each concentration level to account for the variability among fruits and vegetables. To avoidmatrix effects on quantitative results, five quantification strategies were investigated: (i) solvent calibration, (ii) matrix-matched calibration prepared on samples and (iii) on sample extract aliquots, and (iv) standard addition prepared on samples and (v) on sample extract aliquots. Due to the nonlinear instrumental response for the large concentration range investigated, a quadratic calibration model was mandatory for all approaches. Solvent calibration gave very poor recoveries due to the high signal suppression caused by matrix effects. Smaller biases were observed for matrix-matched calibrations; however, these results exhibited relatively low precision. Both of the standard addition methods compensated for matrix effects and provided accurate analytical results. Due to the ease of its implementation, the matrix standard addition method, where analytes are added to sample extract aliquots, was preferred over the classical standard addition in samples. Nonlinear extrapolations appeared to be particularly effective in obtaining good results for both standard addition methods when the calibration curve was convex or very slightly concave. The resulting validated method was used to monitor 108 fruit and vegetable commercial samples in May 2013...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This study aims {{to assess}} the {{susceptibility}} of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates to the antiseptics and disinfectants commonly used, and to the non-approved product. Methods This is a prospective study carried out from February to August 2015, in the Bacteriology department of Mohammed V Military Teaching hospital of Rabat on A. baumannii isolates collected from colonized and/or infected patients and environmental samples. The antiseptics and disinfectants susceptibility testing was assessed using the micromethod validated in our department. The antiseptics and disinfectants studied were: 70 % ethyl alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and a commercial product which was presented as a hospital disinfectant (non-registered product). Results Povidone-iodine, 0. 5 % chlorhexidine digluconate, 70 % ethyl alcohol and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride in combination with N- (3 -aminopropyl) -N-dodecylpropane- 1, 3 -diamine were effective against all the 81 A. baumannii isolates tested, and their logarithmic reduction[*]≥[*] 5 were observed in 100 % of the isolates in their undiluted form. The strains isolated from patients were more resistant than environmental strains: at a dilution of ½ for 70 % ethyl alcohol (37. 77 % vs 11. 11 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 007) and at a dilution of 1 / 10 (100 % vs 69. 44 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) for povidone iodine. The non-registered product was ineffective with a resistance rate of 96. 29 % at a dilution of 1 / 50, 45. 67 % at a dilution of 1 / 10 and 13. 58 % in its purest form. Conclusion Our study revealed {{the effectiveness of the}} main disinfectants and antiseptics used in Morocco; three antiseptics tested were effective in their purest form against the 81 A. baumannii isolates. Regarding disinfectants, our results showed an efficacy of didecyl dimethyl ammonium at the recommended use concentration and in its purest form. This study emphasizes the need for using disinfectants and antiseptics in dilutions recommended by the manufacturer because the insufficient dilutions of these products are not effective. Our findings also demonstrated an inefficiency of the non-registered product against A. baumanii isolates. However, the non-registered products should be prohibited...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 While the {{heartwood}} of many wood species exhibits excellent {{resistance to}} fungal and insect attack, this resistance is sometimes diminished in second-growth material {{of the same}} species. The reasons for the reduced durability are unclear, but they may reflect {{a combination of both}} higher proportions of sapwood as well as reduced levels of heartwood extractives. Second growth timbers are often faster grown and this accelerated growth may affect the production of toxic extractives present in the heartwood. Reduced durability may affect the reputation, quality, and values of the final products. One approach for maintaining the quality of naturally durable second-growth timbers is to supplementarily treat the wood with low concentrations of preservatives. In this research, we evaluated the ability of two commercially-available and environmental-friendly preservatives to protect both the sapwood and heartwood of teak, western red cedar, and coastal redwood. Cubes of these timbers and southern pine, a decay susceptible control, were vacuum-pressure treated with varying retentions of <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC), and 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl- 4 -isothiazolin- 3 -one (DCOI), or alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ). Preservatives performance was assessed first in a leaching test. Preservative concentrations in the wood changed little after leaching. Durability improvement was assessed by exposing treated cubes to two decay fungi (Trametes versicolor and Postia placenta) in a soil block test. The results suggested that DCOI (0. 6 kg/m 3) and DDAC (4 kg/m 3) improved sapwood durability of teak, redwood, and western red cedar. While the performance of all treated heartwood was better than the performance of the untreated samples, these differences were too small to delineate differences. These results provided weak evidence that supplemental treatment may enhance heartwood durability. Finally, we evaluated possible interactions between heartwood extractives and DDAC and DCOI, using a bioassay with Trametes versicolor and Postia placenta on agar medium. Sawdust of teak, coastal redwood and western red cedar were extracted with solvents of various polarities and impregnated on filter paper disks. The disks were placed on Petri dish surfaces previously inoculated with fungal suspensions. Western red cedar and teak extractives inhibited growth of the fungi, while coastal redwood extractives had no antifungal activity. Combinations of these extractives and chemical preservatives were no more efficient than the individual chemical. The results suggest that supplemental treatments do not synergistically interact with the heartwood extractives...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{environmental}} concerns associated with currently used wood preservatives {{have seen a}} trend {{in the development of}} biocides that include inorganic-organic binary mixtures. One such mixture is the ammoniacal copper quaternary ammonium system (ACQ) which contains copper as the primary biocide and <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DDAC) as the co-biocide. In view of experience in agriculture and horticulture, where similar changes from inorganic to organic formulations resulted in failure through the development of tolerance to the organic compounds in target organisms, the present investigation set out to determine if a similar fate awaits these binary wood preservatives which are exposed continuously {{to a wide range of}} microorganisms in soil. Soil fungi tolerant of DDAC, copper and a combination of both were isolated from liquid medium inoculated with soil and from treated blocks of Pinus radiata sapwood which had been buried in soil for 26 weeks. Matric potentials of soil and blocks were determined and treated blocks were buried in soil to give two moisture contents. More species of fungi were isolated from blocks at the higher moisture content than at the lower one. All were Hyphomycetes and included species of Verticillium, Paecilomyces and Gliocladium. Growth of selected tolerant isolates, measured as extension of colony diameters on PDA, was not sensitive to pH. Variation in growth rates among isolates was not related to tolerance of DDAC. Isolates of Verticillium were the most tolerant. Toxic thresholds of DDAC and copper to selected soil isolates and two wood-decay fungi were determined in liquid media. The fungi varied widely in their responses. Species of soil fungi were more tolerant of these chemicals than were wood-decay species. V. lecanii was the most tolerant of DDAC and was able to grow in medium containing 250 ppm DDAC, while the brown-rot fungus, Antrodia vaillantii was able to tolerate only 2. 5 ppm. V. lecanii was also much more copper tolerant than A. vaillantii and grew in medium containing 12000 ppm elemental copper. Growth of V. lecanii, measured as biomass, was not affected by test concentrations of DDAC. Bioassays in liquid medium showed that the fungus was able to reduce the concentration or activity of DDAC to levels permitting growth of other more sensitive isolates, including wood-decay fungi. None of the soil isolates examined was able to utilise DDAC as a sole source of carbon. Growth rate and biomass production were not affected by 500 ppm copper but at 3000 ppm reduction of both was observed. Inductive coupling plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy analyses showed that V. lecanii reduced the concentration of soluble copper in the growth media. Combinations of DDAC and copper were much more effective against V. lecanii than either component alone and in certain ratios these combinations were synergistic. The amount of copper required to control V. lecanii was substantially less when it was combined with DDAC which could have economic as well as environmental benefits.
