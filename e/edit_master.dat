50|$|The second {{option for}} video editing {{was to use}} two tape machines, one playing back the {{original}} tapes, and the other recording that playback. The original tapes were pre rolled, manually cued to a few seconds {{prior to the start}} of a shot on the player, while the recorder was set to record. Each machine was rolled forward simultaneously, and a punch in recording, similar to punch in / out of early audio multitrack recordings was made at the appropriate moment. Beyond not being very precise, recorders of this era cost much more than a house, making this process an expensive use of the machines. This technique of re-recording from source to <b>edit</b> <b>master</b> came to be known as linear video editing.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between camera stocks and print stocks involves {{a difference in}} the recording process. When the work print or <b>edit</b> <b>master</b> has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.|$|E

50|$|That {{innovation}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} research conducted by CMX, a joint venture of the CBS and Memorex corporations. The intent was to create a much less haphazard method of editing video directly that had all of the creative control of traditional film editing. The result, the CMX 600, accomplished this goal with a two part process. Camera master tapes were dubbed as black and white analog video to very large computer memory discs. The editor could access any shot exactly, and quickly edit a precise black and white, low quality version of the program. More importantly, re-editing was trivial, as no cuts were actually performed. The shots were simply accessed and played in sequence from the disc in real time. The computer kept track of all the numbers in this offline stage of the process, and when the editor was satisfied, output them as an Edit decision list (EDL). This EDL was used in the final stage of the process, the online edit. To make it work, special computer to video tape recorder (VTR) edit interfaces had to be developed, called I-Squareds. Under the control of a computer reading back the EDL and communications protocols, these I-Squareds took control and shuttled the broadcast quality VTRs exactly to the points necessary to record and <b>edit</b> <b>master</b> with exact edits from the source tapes.|$|E
50|$|Betacam was {{initially}} introduced as a camera line {{along with a}} video cassette player. The first cameras were the BVP-3, which utilized three saticon tubes, and the BVP1, which used a single tri-stripe Trinicon tube. Both these cameras could be operated standalone, or with their docking companion VTR, the BVV-1 (quickly superseded by the BVV-1A), to form the BVW-1 (BVW-1A) integrated camcorder. Those decks were record-only. The only transport controls on the deck were Eject and Rewind. The docked camera's VTR button started and paused the tape recorder. Later the Betacam SP docking decks had full transport controls (except a Record button) but tapes could not be played back except in the camera's viewfinder in black-and-white only. Sony then {{came out with the}} Play Adapter, a separate portable unit that connected via a multi-pin cable and had a composite video out jack for color playback. At first color playback required the studio source deck, the BVW-10, which could not record, only play back. It was primarily designed as a feeder deck for A/B roll edit systems, usually for editing to a one-inch Type C or three-quarter-inch U-matic cassette <b>edit</b> <b>master</b> tape. There was also the BVW-20 field playback deck, which was a portable unit with DC power and a handle, that was used to verify color playback of tapes in the field. Unlike the BVW-10, it did not have a built in Time Base Corrector, or TBC.|$|E

Can {{some of the issues}} that emerge be useful in understanding the emergence of modern cities? Emergence of Archaic Urban Centers Urban centers can be classified based upon: Size (size of population area covered, density). Location (coastal, riverine, valley floor, and mountain top) Function (market, religious, administrative, defensive, trade) Position in a decision making hierarchy. Form or morphology (concentric, sector, multiple nuclei. City Morphologies Express the overall function and structure of an urban area. Majority of models are taken from modern cities. Used as a vehicle to understand ancient cities. Concentric zone city model. The city center is in area I, surrounded by a factory district and retrogressing neighborhoods in areas IIa and IIb. Areas III, IV, and V are worker residences, middle class residences, and commuter residences respectively (Marcus, 1983 : 199).
