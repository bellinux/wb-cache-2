25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined <b>in</b> <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|Most bite mark {{analysis}} studies use porcine skin (pigskin), {{because it}} {{is comparable to the}} skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks. Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity. Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig suggest using a G-clamp on an articulator <b>in</b> <b>future</b> <b>studies</b> to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin. Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.|$|E

Oliver Markley of SRI (now SRI International) was hired in 1978 to move the program into a more applied and professional direction. The program moved to the University of Houston in 2007 and renamed the degree to Foresight. The program has remained focused on preparing professional futurists and providing high-quality foresight training for individuals and organizations in business, government, education, and non-profits. In 1976, the M.A. Program in Public Policy <b>in</b> Alternative <b>Futures</b> at the University of Hawaii at Manoa was established. The Hawaii program locates <b>futures</b> <b>studies</b> within a pedagogical space defined by neo-Marxism, critical political economic theory, and literary criticism. In the years following the foundation of these two programs, single courses <b>in</b> <b>Futures</b> <b>Studies</b> at all levels of education have proliferated, but complete programs occur only rarely.

5000|$|As {{the plural}} term “futures” suggests, {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} assumptions <b>in</b> <b>futures</b> <b>studies</b> is that the future is plural not singular. That is, the future consists not of one inevitable future that is to be “predicted,” but rather of multiple alternative futures of varying likelihood which may be derived and described, and about which it is impossible to say with certainty which one will occur. The primary effort <b>in</b> <b>futures</b> <b>studies,</b> then, is to identify and describe alternative <b>futures</b> <b>in</b> order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects. The exercise of identifying alternative futures includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plural term [...] "futures" [...] <b>in</b> <b>futures</b> <b>studies</b> denotes both the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied, as well as the tenet that the future is many.|$|R
