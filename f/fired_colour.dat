50|$|The <b>fired</b> <b>colour</b> of tired clay bricks is {{influenced}} by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around 1300 C. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as London stock brick and Cambridgeshire White. Brick tinting may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.|$|E
40|$|Kelantan state, {{regarded}} as the cradle of Malay culture is not only known for her unique cultural heritage, but also a land blessed with both metallic and non-metallic minerals. These include enormous clay deposits discovered in six (6) districts with estimated total reserve of 29. 4 million tonnes of ball clay and 51. 5 million tonnes of mottled clay. Hence, this paper investigates the physiochemical and mineralogical properties of the clay deposits. This was achieved by reviewing existing literatures and reports at the Mineral and Geoscience Department, Malaysia. The properties investigated were green and fired clay colour, plasticity, green strength, dry and fired shrinkage, porosity, chemical and mineral composition. The properties of the clay revealed that they have geographical IP potential; particularly, the predominantly off-white <b>fired</b> <b>colour</b> of the ball clay at temperature range of 900 - 11000 C can secure an identity for Kelantan ceramics in the local, national or international market. Based on these properties, the ball clay is applicable for table ware, earthenware and local tile production while the mottled clay has a potential use for vitrified clay pipe, local tile and brick production...|$|E

Some of the physical properties investigated include plasticity index, linear shrinkage and <b>firing</b> characteristics (<b>firing</b> <b>colour,</b> shrinkage percentage, and water absorption capacity).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{ceramics}} that were found during the field season excavation of May 2012 at the pre-Columbian site Aguas Buenas, Nicaragua, AD 400 - 1400. Aguas Buenas is situated in the Chontales province, Central Nicaragua, where {{there is not much}} archaeological research done. Linguistic and ethno historical research shows that the province was a cultural complex area in pre-Columbian times. Aguas Buenas is the largest known site in this province and so far only studies in surveys. The aim of the thesis is trying to say something about the identity of the people who build the site and regional interaction. During the field season of 2012 pottery was the most found material. The ceramics were studied using a modal analysis. The following modes were analysed: pot shape, lip shape, diameter of the pot, <b>firing</b> <b>colour,</b> colour, slip, decoration, and surface finishing. These results are compared with previous studies from Chontales and the Pacific region of Nicaragua...|$|R
