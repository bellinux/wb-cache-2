5|$|Winchelsey and the barons {{joined in}} {{demanding}} reforms from the king at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, but Winchelsey's support of Boniface VIII's {{claim to be}} the protector of Scotland, broke the alliance. One of the reasons which led the archbishop to ally with the barons was his hostility to Edward's adviser, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. The king took no action against Winchelsey until the Gascon and former royal clerk Bertrand de <b>Got</b> <b>was</b> named Pope Clement V in 1305. Edward then sent two envoys– Langton and Henry Lacy– to the pope, to press his claim that Winchelsey was plotting against him. Clement suspended the archbishop on 12 February 1306. Winchelsey left England and went to the papal court at Bordeaux, where he stayed until Edward's death in July 1307. Only Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham supported the archbishop.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of the {{national}} championship game was tightly contested, with neither team leading by more than six points. At halftime, the score was tied at 31. Wisconsin scored first in the second half, and slowly built the lead as high as nine points. However, Duke fought back, and tied the score at 54 with 7 minutes to go. Duke took the lead {{for the first time in}} the second half with 5:30 remaining, but the game remained tight. With 3:30 remaining, Duke held a one-point lead, when Jahlil Okafor re-entered the game after sitting most of the second half in foul trouble. He scored on back to back possessions, giving Duke a 63–58 lead. After that, the closest Wisconsin <b>got</b> <b>was</b> 66–63 with 45 seconds left. Duke hit two foul shots and Wisconsin did not score again for a 68–63 final margin. The win gave Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski his fifth title, putting him in second place all-time for Division I Men's Basketball Titles.|$|E
5000|$|In BrE, {{have got}} or have {{can be used}} for {{possession}} and have got to and have to {{can be used for}} the modal of necessity. The forms that include <b>got</b> <b>are</b> usually used in informal contexts and the forms without got in contexts that are more formal. In American speech the form without <b>got</b> <b>is</b> used more than in the UK, although the form with <b>got</b> <b>is</b> often used for emphasis. Colloquial AmE informally uses got as a verb for these meanings—for example, I got two cars, I got to go.|$|R

While on leave, he was also able to make contact with his brother Norman, who was serving as a military policeman in Beirut. Completing his tour with No.3 Squadron, Arthur was repatriated to Australia with his new bride in March 1942. Their ship journeyed to Melbourne via Bombay and Colombo, where it picked up many refugees following the recent fall of Singapore. The couple eventually had four children.|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty.

However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know that you could be attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E

He explained that, [...] "the first time we did it, all we <b>got</b> <b>was</b> a big square hole [...] but we didn't want it to look like Bugs Bunny with his ears sticking out, either".

[...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars.

I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of Hill's {{impressive}} climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge, Fontainebleau, and Buoux. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing [...] "wildly acrobatic climbs" [...] with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried sport climbing in France {{for the first time}} that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia '86, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the Rock Master annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a [...] "disputed ruling" [...] but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was [...] "disorienting" [...] because she did not understand the language, the [...] "format" [...] or the [...] "judging" [...] nor did the organizers of the competition. [...] "There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response I <b>got</b> <b>was,</b> 'If the women climb without their tops, then we'll pay them the same.'" [...] However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with [...] "other strong women". In one interview, Hill said that [...] "if there wasn't a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic." [...] Destivelle became Hill's main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s.|$|E
