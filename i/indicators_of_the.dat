5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{information}} about Lōʻihi comes from dives made {{in response to the}} 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.|$|E

5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

25|$|Disparities {{in housing}} explain {{variations}} in the conversion of income into human capabilities over differing social climates. Put more simply; income does not always translate to desirable outcomes like healthcare, education, and happiness. The quality of one's housing is one factor that determines if such capabilities are readily available to an individual. The economist and philosopher Amartya Sen reasons that a person's available freedoms, or capabilities, are significant <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind of life one values or has reason to value. As economic equality varies between economic systems, historical periods, societies so do the housing inequality.|$|E
25|$|All {{things being}} equal, {{at any given}} time, if the {{maturity}} of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a higher CDS spread is considered more likely to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening. However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison. Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers {{to be the best}} <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.|$|E
