40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} traffic routing in telephone networks. At present di mens i oni ng and traffi c routi ng are determi ned {{once a year}} {{in order to meet}} some predefi ned grade of servi ce requirements. For technological reasons, i. e. electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>centres,</b> call routing is now defined according to some fixed static procedure. In order to provide protection against important di sturbances, the network has then to be overdimensioned at the planning stage. The emergence of stored program control networks consisting of <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> inter-connected by common channel signalling links is making possible a new strategy- adaptive traffic routing-, which allows real-time reaction to changes of the network state due to overloads or failures. Several adaptive traffic routing algo-ri thms are therefore descri bed and compared on a testbed network in order to improve network performances...|$|R
50|$|The {{attempts}} {{to replace the}} electromechanical switching matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division switching systems used electromechanical switching networks with SPC.

The two types of space division <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> systems are using electromechanical switching network and the other using <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> network.

40|$|Abstract- We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} optical network designs using relatively few switch nodes at which wavelength conversion and electronic regeneration is possible. A simple heuristic for placing the fewest such nodes to reach a given blocking probability {{is based on the}} ranked frequency of shortest-path routes transiting each node. This strategy is found to be efficient in designing a “translucent ” optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement that performs very close in blocking to that of an “opaque ” optical network. In addition, we apply a new 2 -D Dijkstra’s algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in the resultant translucent optical network. Simulation results indicate that a translucent optical network with sparse <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> placement based on the heuristic has much lower blocking than a fully transparent optical network when the constraint of the maximum transparent distance before regeneration is also considered. Moreover by placing the switches according to the heuristic, lightpath blocking can approach that of a fully opaque network with significantly fewer <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> in total. In our results, lightpath blocking as low as the fully opaque network case was obtained with <b>electronic</b> <b>switches</b> selectively placed at approximately 1 node in 3 on average. The heuristic also performs well against random searching for an effective subset of <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> nodes and performs better than a prior optima...|$|R

In such a switch architecture, there is a switch stage which consists of an optical switch module and an <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> module. Optical signals passing through the switch stage can be switched either by the optical switch module or the <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> module.
