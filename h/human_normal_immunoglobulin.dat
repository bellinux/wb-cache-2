40|$|The focal form {{of mixed}} tick-borne encephalitis-Borrelia {{infection}} (MTBEBI) {{is characterized by}} a nervous system lesion with the development of permanent neurological disorders and a possible fatal outcome. Uniform approaches to treating MTBEBI have not been currently elaborated.  Obviously, adequate treatment of the mixed infection requires a comprehensive approach and simultaneous action on tick-borne encephalitis and tick-borne borreliosis. Its promising treatment is immunocorrection with <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> that contains a wide spectrum of antibodies and exerts an immunomodulatory effect. Objective: to evaluate the efficiency of combination (etiotropic and pathogenetic) therapy with <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> for the focal form of MTBEBI. Patients and methods.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which capsular polysaccharides inhibit phagocytosis is not clearly understood. We investigated the association between a negative surface charge and inhibition of phagocytosis by the capsular polysaccharide of Cryptococcus neoformans. A two-polymer aqueous-phase system containing phosphate ions {{was used to assess}} surface charge. Opsonins such as normal bovine serum and <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G reduced the surface charge on non-encapsulated cryptococci and simultaneously enhanced phagocytosis.

F (ab′) 2 fragments of <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G neither enhanced phagocytosis nor altered the surface charge of non-encapsulated cryptococci. Addition of purified cryptococcal polysaccharide to non-encapsulated cells inhibited phagocytosis of the yeast and induced a strong negative charge at the yeast surface.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study has}} shown that {{intravenous}} <b>normal</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (IVIG), when included into combined therapy of acute epiglottitis, exerts positive effect upon clinical course {{of the disease and}} contributes to normalisation of immune status. Due to IVIG therapy, an increase in IgA and sIgA concentrations is observed in laryngopharynx secretions. Amounts and affinity of serum antibodies to common bacterial antigenic determinant are increased in blood, as well as opsonizing properties of blood serum. Moreover, a higher phagocytic and bactericidal activity of neutrophils is observed with such treatment.

40|$|Recently, {{naturally}} occurring antibodies to IFN-alpha {{were discovered in}} a few systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cancer patients; however, in most patients monitored for anti-IFN antibodies before treatment, no antibodies were found. In an attempt to explain the 'IFN-blocking effect' that we observed in all serum samples we investigated 200 sera from healthy blood donors. We isolated the globulin fraction, and used rabbit anti-human IgG and IgM columns, protein A columns and T-gel affinity chromatography to isolate human IgG and IgM. All sample fractions were tested in a biological IFN neutralization assay {{by means of a}} sensitive MTT-assay. We found that normal human serum contained autoantibodies to crude human leucocyte IFN, native human fibroblast IFN, recombinant human leucocyte IFN-alpha 2 b and recombinant human IFN-gamma, and that these {{naturally occurring}} antibodies were biologically active immunoglobulins of IgG and IgM type. These anti-IFN antibodies were also present in purified <b>human</b> <b>normal</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> pools.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{develop a}} {{rational}} practice policy for prophylaxis against hepatitis A for travellers to high risk areas. DESIGN [...] 18 Month prospective study of consecutive patients who requested prophylaxis against hepatitis A. SETTING [...] Inner city general practice. SUBJECTS [...] 104 Patients aged 15 - 61 (mean 30) assessed for {{risk factors for}} hepatitis A and put into groups depending on predictions from the risk factors of their immunity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS [...] All patients were screened for antibody to hepatitis A virus. Of 52 patients with no risk factors 47 had no antibody and were thus susceptible to hepatitis A. All 27 patients with major risk factors (having been brought up in an endemic area or {{with a history of}} jaundice) were immune. Of 25 patients with minor risk factors (a history of previous travel in high risk areas, drug abuse, having lived in a squat or travelled rough, or having lived with someone who had jaundice) 12 were immune (p less than 0. 001, chi 2 test).

40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} a review of {{different}} management strategies for the hematological manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the strategies include immunosuppressive drugs, some noval therapies and B-cell depletion for refractory thrombocytopenia in patients with SLE and in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome associated with SLE. The researcher questions {{the validity of the}} current classic treatment modes and the article explores the relationships between SLE hematological manifestations and the level of morbidity and mortality burden and focuses on the pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches and management strategies of these manifestations. The researcher focuses on hematological abnormalities because they are the commonest among most manifestations in SLE seen in Anemia, leucopenias and thrombocytopenia. They commonly result from an immune mediated bone marrow failure, excessive peripheral cells destruction or certain drugs and infections. There is also an association between anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) and SLE referred to as secondary APS or SLE-APS. Furthermore, it was recently found that mycophenolatemofetil acts as corticosteroids and as cyclophosphamide sparing agent. Although there is no specific therapy for cytopenias in SLE, corticosteroids remain the mainstay in the treatment of these patients along with less used other conventional treatment options such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and <b>human</b> <b>normal</b> <b>immunoglobulin.</b> There are other novel therapies such as thrombopoietin receptor agonists in thrombocytopenia and the use of autologous hematopoitic stem cells transplantation in refractory SLE-APS that are under review.

Randomised controlled trials have shown that high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is superior to placebo in improving muscle strength and disability, but many patients require periodic infusions to maintain long-term improvement. This observational, multicentre, retrospective study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of <b>human</b> <b>normal</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (Ig VENA) at high intravenous infusion rates in 20 MMN patients (14 male, 6 female). Thirty days after the first infusion, there was an improvement of at least 1 point in two muscles compared to baseline on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and of 1 point in the ONLS (Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale) scale in 15 patients (75 %) and 10 patients (50 %), respectively; 45 % improved on both scales. At 6 months, 100 % of 12 patients had improved on the MRC and 79 % of 14 patients had improved on the ONLS scale; 83 % improved on both scales.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of vaccine when time since exposure is prolonged (more than 1 week from onset of illness {{in the index}} case) is unknown, but {{is likely to be}} significantly lower than <b>human</b> <b>normal</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (HNIG). We estimated the number of additional secondary cases that may occur through giving vaccine instead of HNIG to contacts of cases of hepatitis A who are identified more than 1 week after onset in the index case. This was calculated for different levels of vaccine efficacy, assuming HNIG efficacy to be 80 – 90 %. The number of households that need to be treated to prevent one secondary case was calculated using estimates of secondary attack ratios (AR). If more than 1 week has elapsed from onset of illness in the index case, for an average household size of 2 · 3 people, a vaccine {{efficacy of}} 50 % and an AR of 10 – 25 %, 8 – 26 households would need to be treated with vaccine before one additional secondary case would be observed. As UK public health professionals manage around one hepatitis A case per month, it would take from 8 months to over 2 years for them to observe one additional case amongst contacts using vaccine rather than HNIG. It is unlikely that an average practitioner would notice if vaccine were 30 % less effective than HNIG.

40|$|Secondary {{thrombotic}} microangiopathies {{are associated}} with several underlying conditions, with most of them being resolved after the treatment of background disease. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare microangiopathy presenting with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurological deficits, occurring most often in various autoimmune diseases due to inhibition of ADAMTS 13 by autoantibodies, {{as well as in}} pregnant women with or without an autoimmune substrate. In this article, we report two newly diagnosed TTP cases, who have not been published so far. The first is a 27 -year-old woman with a history of polyarticular rheumatoid factor negative juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who presented with thrombocytopenia, anemia, schistocytes on blood smear, headache, and active arthritis.
