5000|$|In condemning Bouch's Southesk viaduct for {{defective}} foundations after rigorous testing, Colonel Yolland (the {{head of the}} Railway Inspectorate) {{had also}} stated his opinion that [...] "piers constructed of cast-iron columns of the dimensions used in this viaduct should not in future be sanctioned by the Board of Trade.". Marindin's report noted that [...] " [...] This disaster furnishes a very convincing proof of the unreliability of small cast-iron columns when used for the piers of viaducts in positions where {{they are likely to}} be exposed to any blow or sudden shock [...] " [...] but drew a slightly different conclusion: that [...] "it would be far better in future to avoid any such mode of construction.". Consequently, Marindin stopped well short of requiring any reconstruction of the viaduct to use only wrought-iron columns: [...] "I do not, however, consider that the reconstruction of this viaduct need be objected to provided due care is taken, either by the erection of timber ice fenders or by the substitution of wrought iron rakers of sufficient strength to withstand the blows of the floating <b>ice,</b> to <b>guard</b> the cast iron bearing columns from any such danger…. And it is worthy of consideration whether it would not be better to increase the width of the spans at the centre of the channel, so as to permit the ice to pass more freely than it does at present." ...|$|R

[...] This continued {{for the next two}} weeks, taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea. [...] Further delays then slowed progress {{after the turn of the}} year, before a lengthy run south during 7–10 January 1915 brought them close to the [...] <b>ice</b> walls which <b>guarded</b> the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land. This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904, during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. On 15 January Endurance came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place. [...] However, Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing, [...] "except under pressure of necessity"—a decision he would later regret. On 17 January the ship reached a latitude of 76°27′S, where land was faintly discernible. Shackleton named it Caird Coast, after his principal backer.

5000|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt took {{a strong}} {{personal}} interest in Greenland's fate. On 9 April 1941, {{the anniversary of the}} German occupation, the Danish envoy Kauffmann, against the instructions of his government, signed an executive agreement with Secretary of State Cordell Hull, allowing the presence of American troops and making Greenland a de facto U.S. protectorate. The cryolite mine in Ivigtut was a unique asset that made it possible for Greenland to manage fairly well economically during the war. The United States supplied the island and sent patrol boats to survey the east coast of Greenland although this activity was limited by seasonal <b>ice.</b> The Coast <b>Guard,</b> in coordination with Eske Brun, created the Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol, consisting of 15 men, many of them former hunters in the area. Their task was to patrol the coast to discover any German activity. However, in 1941 there was no such landing, although the Norwegian resupply trawler [...] was encountered in September. Among its otherwise innocuous crew and passengers was a civilian Norwegian who intended to provide weather reports for German contacts in Norway. This ship was seized and brought to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
2500|$|On 8 September, Ice Boat No. 3, {{along with}} the other two ice boats, participated in a naval parade in honor of the Grand Army of the Republic. Ice Boat No. 3, skippered by Captain Henry E. Melville, {{superintendent}} of the city ice boats, embarked guests from Pier 3, South Wharves at 10:30 am. While leaving the Chestnut Street dock to join the parade, No. 3 collided with the steamboat John A. Warner, striking the latter [...] "about fifteen feet from her stern, cutting through her plank sheer and clear into her deck." [...] Declining to stop and inquire after damages, the ice boat continued up the river, where she suffered a second collision, this time with the passenger-cargo steamboat Major Reybold which had just reversed out of dock, damaging the <b>ice</b> boat's starboard <b>guard</b> and Major Reybolds stem. Again failing to stop, No. 3 continued on to the parade starting point at Fort Mifflin. After the parade was over, the guests were returned by the ice boat to Chestnut St. wharf about 4:15 pm, the vessel then continuing on to her usual berth at the House of Correction dock, arriving 6:15 pm. In a subsequent court case, the owners of Major Reybold sued for $1,425 in damages.|$|R

Zenobia orders Rafi to attack Melanthius {{and is about to}} hurt Dione with a knife, but he is attacked by Kassim and is killed falling down the temple stairs. Momentarily overcome with grief, Zenobia cradles her son while Sinbad and Melanthius investigate how to get Kassim into the column of light {{at the top of the}} shrine which will break the spell. Having come to her senses again and seeing Kassim restored to human form, Zenobia transfers her spirit into the Smilodon. Breaking free of its icy prison, the giant cat attacks the group but the troglodyte then enters the scene and engages the Smilodon in combat. Initially gaining the upper hand and even slamming the beast to the ground, the Smilodon disarms the troglodyte of its spear and pins it to the wall, inflicting more damage before killing it via biting the neck. Sinbad and his men fight against the Smilodon but overpowered by its speed and Maroof is killed. The Smilodon then attacks Sinbad who uses the troglodyte's spear to jab it in the chest, killing the Smilodon and Zenobia. With the spell on Kassim is broken and Zenobia dead, and the adventurers flee the temple as it collapses and buried in snow and ice.|$|R
2500|$|Jaime {{takes the}} fight to the Reach, using the time-warping qualities of the Bleed to attack three of their {{machines}} at once. When this fails, Jaime attacks the Reach's flagship, but the Reach use their weapons to attack his home. Jaime's emotional outburst at this attack allows the Reach {{to shut down the}} scarab and remove it from Jaime, who is thrown into a holding cell while the scarab is taken for examination. However, the scarab transfers its knowledge into Jaime before removal, allowing the young hero to break free. Meanwhile, Jaime's family, having escaped the attack, are protected from further Reach assault by Peacemaker, the Posse, Traci Thirteen, La Dama and later Guy Gardner, Fire and <b>Ice.</b> Attacking several <b>guards</b> and taking their armor, Jaime heads for the engine, forcing the Reach to shut it down which reveals their ship. Once captured and brought to the bridge, Jaime shouts [...] "Khaji Da!". He then reveals that, during the time spent with him, the scarab has gained a personality of its own and fully detached itself from the Reach hive-mind. Claiming Khaji Da (the combined utterance of Khaji, the codeword for Infiltrator and Da, its own serial number) as its name, the scarab sides with Reyes against the Reach. As the battle continues the Reach Negotiator unleashes a doomsday device on Earth in retaliation for his defeat. Jaime and the scarab agree to sacrifice themselves to stop the superweapon. At the last moment, Booster Gold appears and saves them both. The bond with the scarab stronger than ever, Jaime wonders if other scarabs will gain a personality due to Khaji Da talking to them about individuality.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to test the mechanical response of varying quality <b>ice</b> hockey shin <b>guards</b> under appropriate impact conditions. Junior shin guards (n = 5) and adult shin guards (n = 14) were analyzed independently. The results of the junior experiment revealed that many shin guards included in the experiment sustained some degree of material damage. However, even in a damaged state, variations in mechanical response to impact conditions did exist between the shin guards. The results of the adult experiment revealed that some shin guards used in the experiment sustained some degree of material damage. Significant interaction effects (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) of shin guard and impact energy level were revealed for all ANOVAs performed that included two or three impact energy levels. For the ANOVAs performed including only one impact energy level, significant main effects (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) of shin guard were revealed. Similarly to the junior experiment, not only did adult shin guards vary from one another in their mechanical responses to the impact conditions, variations in mechanical responses also existed between the tibia and knee locations of any one shin guard. Softer or more compliant shin guards, as characterized by lower loading rate values, did tend to reduce peak force, and increase time to peak force. As a result, more compliant shin guards transmitted less of an impulse and therefore absorbed more energy in the process. These findings suggest that more compliant shin guards can offer a degree of injury prevention for athletes. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of experimental design limitations.
