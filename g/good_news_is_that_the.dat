2500|$|The {{hydrologist}} Peter Gleick comments: [...] "Few rational observers {{deny the}} need for boundaries to freshwater use. More controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them. Another way to describe these boundaries {{is the concept of}} peak water. Three different ideas are useful. 'Peak renewable' water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed. Many of the world’s major rivers are already approaching this threshold—when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources. 'Peak nonrenewable' limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates, such as in fossil groundwater basins of the Great Plains, Libya, India, northern China and parts of California’s Central Valley. 'Peak ecological' water is the idea that for any hydrological system, increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes. Although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately, we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred [...] The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> potential for savings, without hurting human health or economic productivity, is vast. Improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector. More food can be grown with less water (and less water contamination) by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers, along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture. Conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling, and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water, such as photovoltaics and wind." ...|$|E

Moving Hearts have become a purely {{instrumental}} band, and this new set {{is very much a}} reworking of their 1985 instrumental album, The Storm, but now performed with even more confidence and attack. The aim, it seems, is to mix Irish traditional influences with a dash of jazz and rock, and the result is a pomp-folk hybrid style that would be ideal for an Irish-flavoured Hollywood epic." ...|$|E

The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show still has rock-solid character dynamics to fall back on, whether that involves Kara's new friendship with Mon-El, the Alex/Maggie partnership or J'onn's efforts to bond with his fellow Martian survivor." ...|$|E

50|$|The Bruins {{tied the}} Carolina Hurricanes in {{points for the}} regular season at 88. However, Carolina had two more wins than the Bruins, leaving the Bruins in the 9th {{position}} in the conference, narrowly missing the playoffs. Boston was without starting goaltender Byron Dafoe {{for much of the}} season, and the Bruins had to use five goaltenders throughout the season. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bruins saw some of their young core mature further, as Joe Thornton set a then-career high in goals with 37, and Jason Allison once again broke the 30-goal plateau.|$|E
50|$|The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Martians seem friendly.

Kit's long-standing fascination with all things Martian {{unexpectedly}} enmeshes him in a terrible, age-old conflict—turning him into both a possible key to its solution, and a tool that in the wrong hands shortly threatens the whole human race.|$|E

5000|$|The Diaries {{represent}} a remarkable and unprecedented statement {{by a former}} leader of a major political party. In the book, Latham is scathing about Australia's political system: It takes committed people ... and turns them into one-dimensional robots ... The only <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public is on to them. The electorate has worked out the artificiality of it all. They can see through the spin doctors, the publicity stunts, the polling and the tricks of marginal-seat campaigning. This is why people now talk about politics with a cool anger.

5000|$|Esteller {{works on}} the field of epigenetics in health and disease. Starting from {{identical}} genetic sequences, changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation can produce organisms with different features and distinct susceptibility to sickness. An example is monozygotic twins. To have a complete picture {{of what is going on}} with the epigenetic tapestry of our cells, Esteller has advocated the development of a comprehensive Human Epigenome Project (HEP) to map all the epigenetic marks in our genetic material. This could have a huge impact in cancer patients, because we already know that malignant cells have a profound disregulation of DNA methylation and histone modification patterns.

5000|$|The {{original}} slogan {{chosen for}} the Italian campaign reads: [...] "The bad <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God does not exist. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you don't need it". On 16 January 2009 IGPDecaux, the company holding licenses for ads on public transport in Genoa, refused to give authorization to the atheist bus campaign {{on the grounds that}} it may [...] "offend the moral, civic and religious convictions of the public". Antonio Catricalà, the then head of the Italian National Authority for Fair Trading and Competition, announced that the Authority filed a case against the Atheist Bus initiative because of the potentially [...] "dangerous and mendacious nature" [...] of the ads. As a reaction, the UAAR launched a new campaign in Genoa with a different slogan to comply with the advertising authority's rules: [...] "The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> millions of atheists in Italy.

5000|$|AllMusic {{rated the}} album with 3 stars; in his review, Alex Henderson noted: [...] "Wilson's musical {{personality}} {{is very much}} in evidence -- and his personality is that of an arranger/bandleader, not a hotshot soloist. Wilson prefers to leave the soloing to other people, which is something he has long had in common with Duke Ellington". In JazzTimes Ira Gitler wrote: [...] "Hats off to the all-star band, but especially Wilson for the intersectional sonic vibrancy and overall dynamics he gave them to work with". On All About Jazz Russell Moon noted: [...] "There is good and bad news here. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album is terrific. Many jazz fans will be introduced to Wilson's talent through this album, and will seek more. No doubt Gerald Wilson will be in demand because of this album. The bad news is that the New Sound of New York isn't as good as the old sound of Los Angeles to this listener's ears... So give Gerald Wilson full marks for the courage to take on some of his best work and give it a new visage".|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote, [...] "The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kids will {{probably}} love it, {{and the bad}} news is that parents will be disappointed if they're hoping for another Pixar groundbreaker. Unlike such brightly original films as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, WALL-E, and Up, this one finds Pixar poaching on traditional territory of Disney." [...] He said that the film did have an uplifting message about improving communication between mothers and daughters, [...] "although transforming your mother into a bear is a rather extreme first step". Peter Debruge of Variety gave a positive review of the film, writing that the film [...] "offers a tougher, more self-reliant heroine for an era in which princes aren't so charming, set in a sumptuously detailed Scottish environment, where her spirit blazes bright as her fiery red hair". Debruge said that [...] "adding a female director, Brenda Chapman, to its creative boys' club, the studio Pixar has fashioned a resonant tribute to mother-daughter relationships that packs a level of poignancy on par with such beloved male-bonding classics as Finding Nemo".|$|E

Jay is not able to release him from the hanging bar resulting he hangs upside down for almost 10 hours. He is found in the morning by the downstair neighbour Hans Rimmer and taken into hospital. He is paralyzed as from his hips to his toes and even his penis is affected. He barely can spreak due to damage on his adam's apple. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> doctors claim this is only temporary and all of this will recover over time. When Devon hears about the news, he visits the Callboys. During a phone call to Jay, Devon suggests he will do his hair. Devon designs a hair decoration by using the brake cables and some other attributes from Jay's motorcycle. Jay is happy with the decoration but it is the root cause of his dead not much later. Whilst taking the elevator a part of the brake cable get stuck between the doors resulting he is crushed between the downgoing elevator and the walls.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the nonrecognition {{provision}} are {{set forth}} in part III of subchapter O (Sec. 1031-1045) of the Internal Revenue Code. There are two common examples of such basis mechanisms. First, the gift basis provision in §1015 provides that the gift recipient {{is to take the}} donor’s basis. A second, similar, mechanism exists in §1041, requiring the recipient of marital property in a divorce settlement to take the basis of the transferring spouse. The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recipient in both cases has received a “free” gift. The bad news is that since the Internal Revenue Code requires the recipient to take the donor’s basis, the formula for gain (i.e. Gain = amount received - adjusted basis) will use the lower basis amount resulting in higher gain. Therefore, the taxpayer will likely incur the same (higher) tax liability that the donor would have paid if they had kept the property for themselves. Alternatively, a more favorable rule to taxpayers would have allowed the taxpayer to take the fair market value {{at the time of the}} gift as the basis. This amount would likely be higher. When used in the gain formula, the higher basis would result in lower gain and, therefore, a lower tax liability.|$|E

The <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ringleader’s formula of rounding up superstar talent for an album jammed with potential singles still works, unless you think everything on 2011 radio is trash and that big money ruined hip-hop." [...] Adam Fleischer of XXL gave the album an XL, saying [...] "Though the content of We The Best Forever is what we’ve come to expect from a DJ Khaled offering—grandiose odes to the grind and getting yours—that he understands how to create those better than most is what makes a DJ Khaled track, and album, worthwhile." ...|$|E
