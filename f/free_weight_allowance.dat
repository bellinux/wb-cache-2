50|$|Walking - The {{spectacle}} of a multi-legged robot {{walking across the}} arena into combat is a big audience favorite. Robot combat rules typically have given walking robots an additional <b>weight</b> <b>allowance</b> to offset their slower speed, {{the complexity of the}} mechanism, and to encourage their construction. What the event organizers had in mind was something like the spider-legged robot Mechadon, but what most often was produced were simple rule-shaving propulsion systems that attempted to save as much of the extra <b>weight</b> <b>allowance</b> as possible for additional weaponry. Attempts at more restrictive definitions of “Walking” have effectively eliminated walking robots from competition. BattleBots heavyweight champion Son of Whyachi used a controversial cam-driven “Shufflebot” propulsion system, which was promptly declared ineligible for additional <b>weight</b> <b>allowance</b> at subsequent competitions.|$|R

Felipe Arantes also missed weight for his bout against Érik Pérez, coming in two pounds over the bantamweight <b>weight</b> <b>allowance.</b> He was fined 20 percent of his purse.|$|R

50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>weights</b> are {{recommended}} over machine weights {{for almost all}} athletes. When one uses <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> (barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, rubber tubing, etc.), the resistance can be moved in a manner more suited to the sports skill’s intramuscular pattern. With <b>free</b> <b>weights,</b> the athlete must guide and control the movement throughout the execution. In the process, balance and stability are developed because the entire body participates in every exercise, especially when relatively heavy weights are used.|$|R
40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>weights</b> are {{generally}} preferred over machines by practitioners of strength training because they involve incorporation of greater muscle mass {{because of the}} greater stabilization that is required. Using <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> may therefore allow one to gain more muscle mass and strength with chronic training; however, {{this has not been}} thoroughly addressed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effect of training with <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> or machines on muscle mass, testosterone and cortisol concentrations, and strength. Fifteen males and twenty-one females aged 22 ± 3 y with previous weight training experience trained using only <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> or only machines for eight weeks. Hormone concentrations were assessed via saliva samples pre and post workout at the beginning, mid-way, and end of the study. Muscle thickness, lean tissue mass, and strength were measured at the beginning and the end of the study.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of Army soldiers are sufficiently overweight to exceed the maximum <b>weight</b> <b>allowances</b> defined by the Army weight control program (AR 600 - 9). Also, the body weights of {{a substantial number of}} soldiers approach the maximum <b>weight</b> <b>allowances.</b> These soldiers should not gain additional weight if they are to meet Army <b>weight</b> <b>allowances.</b> The conventional approach to this overweight problem is assigning soldiers to remedial physical training and mandatory referral for nutrition counseling by a health care provider. An alternative to this conventional approach is to target the entire population of soldiers (population-based intervention) to promote weight loss in overweight soldiers and weight gain prevention in soldiers who are approaching overweight status. To accomplish this objective, the Healthy Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Training Headquarters (H. E. A. L. T. H.) program was developed. This article describes the rationale for developing the program, the components of the program, and the utilization promotion strategies of the program. The H. E. A. L. T. H. program includes two primary components: (1) a Web site tailored to the standards established in Field Manual 21 - 20, Physical Fitness Training, Army physical fitness test, and AR 600 - 9, the army weight control program, and (2) a health promotion program designed to promote awareness of the H. E. A. L. T. H. Web site and to facilitate use of the Web site by soldiers and their family members. The Web site is equipped with personalized planning tools and progress tracking over time related to fitness, caloric intake, and lifestyle behavior change goals. The health promotion program includes media advertisements and “ground roots” efforts to facilitate use by soldiers...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} importance of the ideal female body and gender stereotypes amongst a group of female <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> users in a fitness facility in Scotland. Utilising principles of ethnography, information was initially gathered through working as a participant-as-observer to identify different female <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> users within the facility. From this, as well as using a gatekeeper and snowball sampling, twenty women took part in one-to-one interviews. Different groups of women were interviewed including: those training in the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas to aid their sporting performance, for health or aesthetic reasons and those preparing for physique competitions. Interviews focused on the women’s use of the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas, perceptions of their own bodies and their opinions on the ideal female body as well as their interpretations of the concepts femininity, masculinity and muscularity. The unique narrative of each woman was critically analysed with reference to social construction feminism. Whilst interviews were the main data collection technique for this research, participant observation and informal conversations within the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas also informed the findings of this study. The motivations behind women taking part in weight training are presented. Interviewees’ definitions of the ideal female body are explored and the significance of this body is discussed. Factors influencing the women’s definitions of the ideal body are also examined. The impact of social media on participants’ use of the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas is analysed. The women’s perceptions of the terms masculinity, femininity and muscularity are considered alongside how these perceptions affected their training within the <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> areas...|$|R

40|$|Explosive upper-body movements, {{with which}} the load is not thrown (non-ballistic), may {{comprise}} a phase during which forces are produced {{in opposition to the}} motion of the load. Thirty men completed three test sessions (<b>free</b> <b>weight,</b> ballistic, and pneumatic), each consisting of a one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) and four explosive repetitions of a bench press at six loads (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 % 1 -RM). The end of the lifting phase for the non-ballistic conditions (<b>free</b> <b>weight</b> and pneumatic) was defined by: the point of peak barbell displacement and {{the point at which the}} vertical force became negative (positive work). When analysed by peak displacement, the ballistic condition elicited significantly greater mean velocity, force, and power at loads of 15 - 60 % 1 -RM compared with the <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> condition. When the period of negative work was removed, the mean <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> velocity, force, and power at loads below 60 % 1 -RM increased. Consequently, the only differences between the <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> and ballistic conditions were found at loads of 15 % and 30 % 1 -RM. Including a period of negative work may underestimate all kinematic and kinetic variables dependent on the time to, or position of, the end of the lifting phase, for non-ballistic efforts...|$|R
