5|$|About 1558, {{according}} to a <b>date</b> <b>on</b> a fireplace, Bess of Hardwick and her third husband, Sir John's son Sir William St Loe, added a north east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses. Sir William St Loe was a soldier, politician and courtier. His official positions included Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Chief Butler of England and Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may have been {{as a result of}} poisoning by his younger brother. All his property was left Bess, to the detriment of his daughters and brother. When Bess died in 1608 the house was left to her son Charles Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|After Vietnam, the Army {{retained}} the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{as a quick}} deploying contingency brigade. However, with the ending of conscription following America's disengagement from Vietnam, many of the Army's formations had to be rebuilt for the volunteer force. One of these was the 101st Airborne Division, which had also been redeployed to Fort Campbell. It was decided that the 173rd {{would be used to}} help rebuild the division, which had been converted into an airmobile formation during the Vietnam War. The brigade was inactivated on 14 January 1972 at the fort, and its assets were used to form the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, a parachute component within the airmobile 101st. The 3rd Brigade went off jump status on 1 April 1974, the same <b>date</b> <b>on</b> which the Airmobile Badge (Air Assault Badge as of 4 October 1974) was introduced.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, probably on the 20th, as that was the <b>date</b> <b>on</b> which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain <b>date</b> <b>on</b> which Australia became independent, arguing that the distinction is more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's {{body was}} {{originally}} {{buried in the}} portico {{of what is now}} St Augustine's, Canterbury, but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the Norman Conquest the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted. After the Conquest, his shrine in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus. King Henry I of England granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day fair around the <b>date</b> <b>on</b> which Augustine's relics were translated to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.|$|E
