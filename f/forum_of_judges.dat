25|$|McGruder’s {{second term}} (2112–2116) was {{initially}} successful, despite {{the mental health}} problems which she had acquired during the interval, but her mental impairment became worse over time. She suspended the Council of Five (as noted above) in favour <b>of</b> calling <b>forums</b> <b>of</b> senior <b>judges</b> if and when needed. Among several misguided policies was a controversial scheme to use robot judges to alleviate a serious shortage <b>of</b> human <b>judges,</b> continually trying to force the scheme through even though the robots repeatedly malfunctioned and killed people. After a robot attempted to kill her, she was eventually persuaded to resign again. An Interim Council <b>of</b> three <b>judges</b> ruled briefly until a new chief judge was elected.|$|R

50|$|Recently {{one more}} {{slightly}} smaller exedra was found {{south on the}} wall bordering the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan. meaning that in sake of symmetry {{there must have been}} other exedra demolished {{to make room for the}} <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Nerva, rising the number to 4 and not 2 exedras. This completely changes the layout for the south part <b>of</b> the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Augustus, meaning that it is much more similar to the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan and a new theory for this southern part <b>of</b> the <b>forum</b> suggests that in fact there was a basilica between the 2 new exedras (like in the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Trajan).

40|$|Forum {{shopping}} is problematic {{because it may}} lead to forum selling. For diverse motives, including prestige, local benefits, or re-election, some judges {{want to hear more}} cases. When plaintiffs have wide choice <b>of</b> <b>forum,</b> such <b>judges</b> have incentives to make the law more pro-plaintiff, because plaintiffs choose the court. While only a few judges may be motivated to attract more cases, their actions can have large effects, because their courts will attract a disproportionate share of cases. For example, judges in the Eastern District of Texas have distorted the rules and practices relating to case assignment, joinder, discovery, transfer, and summary judgment in order to attract patent plaintiffs to their district. As a result of their efforts, {{more than a quarter of}} all patent infringement suits were filed in the Eastern District of Texas in 2014. Consideration <b>of</b> <b>forum</b> selling helps explain constitutional constraints on personal jurisdiction. Without constitutional limits on jurisdiction, some courts are likely to be biased in favor of plaintiffs in order to attract litigation. This article explores forum selling through five case studies: patent litigation and the Eastern District of Texas and elsewhere, class actions and mass torts in “magnet jurisdictions” such as Madison County, Illinois, bankruptcy and the District of Delaware, ICANN domain name arbitration, and common law judging in early modern England...|$|R

The fact that this structure is not mentioned as having a civil function has prevented it from being classified as a true Forum.
