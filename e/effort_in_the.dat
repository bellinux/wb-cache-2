5|$|After {{considerable}} construction <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of wet weather, the airbase {{was completed}} and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab {{was surrounded by}} mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, {{there was no such}} problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{reached the}} last stage of its {{operational}} evolution during 1967 and 1968.

5|$|As of 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{continued}} the reform agenda covering oversight, integrity, and ethics which {{had previously been}} launched in response to investigation of the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. The Programme responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilians and was the largest, most complex and most ambitious relief <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the United Nations. With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international environmental governance, a unified gender organization, and ‘Delivering as One’ at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities.|$|E

In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} relationships that extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Loxton {{played in}} the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. With pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening Test, Loxton opened the bowling and took 2/22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119. He made only 17 with the bat and took 0/7, again opening in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire; Brown scored a century in a drawn match.|$|E

5|$|By 1828, Brazil {{could no}} longer sustain the war <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south and in April relinquished Cisplatina, which became the {{independent}} nation of Uruguay. Marques de Sousa was sent to Montevideo to serve under field marshal (present-day divisional general) Manuel Jorge Rodrigues, who commanded a Brazilian force temporarily stationed in the new country. On 29 March 1829, Marques de Sousa was made brevet (acting) major, and, on 28 August 1830, he was placed {{in command of the}} 6th company of 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry. Stationed in Rio Grande do Sul, the unit had previously been commanded by his father and his paternal grandfather.|$|E
5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war <b>effort.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy is {{a science}} fiction and fantasy media {{franchise}} created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and developed and owned by Square Enix (formerly Square). The franchise centers {{on a series of}} fantasy and science fantasy role-playing video games (RPGs). The eponymous first game in the series, published in 1987, was conceived by Sakaguchi as his last-ditch <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game industry; the title was a success and spawned sequels. The video game series has since branched into other genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm. The franchise has also branched out into other media, including CGI films, anime, manga, and novels.|$|E

The <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which they suffered further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June. They were subsequently moved back to Torokina.|$|E

5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two world wars and began to suffer a sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods of considerable political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
