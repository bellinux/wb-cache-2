25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the <b>heavy</b> <b>thinking,</b> Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E
60|$|But {{during the}} last few minutes Richard had been doing some <b>heavy</b> <b>thinking,</b> and the {{conclusion}} of it all was that he had better get out as soon as possible. He had nothing in common with such a crowd, and to remain might place him in an awkward if not dangerous position.|$|E
50|$|The {{series is}} {{centered}} around the adventures of Flint Hammerhead, a boy from the prehistoric era who was resurrected from his fossil prison and became a Time Detective, although his competency as a detective is dubious. Much like Inspector Gadget, much of the <b>heavy</b> <b>thinking</b> is done by Flint's friends Sarah and Tony Goodman who accompany him on his adventures. Flint, however, pulled his weight in battle when he would fight {{with the aid of}} his father Rocky Hammerhead whose partial resurrection left him a sentient, talking rock with a face. Rocky, fashioned into a hammer for Flint, served Flint as both sturdy weapon and adviser, the latter {{both in and out of}} battle. Flint's job as a Time Detective was to go back in time and convince time-shifters, cute, collectible creatures to ally with him to protect the timeline.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{certainly}} is a great improvement on the chair business, to which I have devoted myself with such energy that I've broken the backs of two partners and dislocated {{the arm of the}} old rocker. I took an occasional turn with that <b>heavy</b> party, <b>thinking</b> it good practice in case I ever happen to dance with stout ladies." [...] And Mac nodded toward Annabel, pounding gaily with Mr. Tokio, whose yellow countenance beamed as his beady eyes rested on his plump fiancée.|$|R
60|$|His wife {{pretended not}} to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all {{the time they were}} on the water. Matte heard nothing more as he sat and rowed the <b>heavy</b> boat, while <b>thinking</b> of his cracked pipe and the fine tobacco. Then they {{returned}} to the island, and soon after went to bed.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many studies done {{on the effect of}} {{positive}} emotion on the cognitive mind and there is speculation that positive mood can affect our minds in good or bad ways. Generally, positive mood has been found to enhance creative problem solving and flexible yet careful thinking. Some studies have stated that positive moods let people think creatively, freely, and be more imaginative. Positive mood can also help individuals in situations in which <b>heavy</b> <b>thinking</b> and brainstorming is involved. In one experiment, individuals who were induced with a positive mood enhanced performance on the Remote Associates Task (RAT), a cognitive task that requires creative problem solving. Moreover, the study also suggests that being in a positive mood broadens or expands the breadth of attentional selection such that information that may be useful to the task at hand becomes more accessible for use. Consequently, greater accessibility of relevant information facilitates successful problem solving. Positive mood also facilitates resistance to temptations, especially with regards to unhealthy food choices.|$|E
50|$|First, in Thanh Hóa province, {{there was}} a {{fisherman}} named Lê Thận, who {{was not related to}} Lê Lợi in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something <b>heavy.</b> <b>Thinking</b> of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and {{not knowing what to do}} with it, put it in the corner of his house.|$|E

5000|$|Species 8472 possess {{incredible}} {{strength and}} stamina {{as demonstrated in}} the episode [...] "Prey", when a single member of Species 8472 is attacked by a Hirogen hunting party with <b>heavy</b> weapons. <b>Thinking</b> it dead, they {{take it back to}} their ship, only to discover otherwise after the alien injures the Alpha Hirogen and decapitates his subordinate. When the alien makes its way across Voyagers hull, it tears through a bulkhead {{to gain access to the}} ship. Though the alien is badly injured, it eventually heals itself, regenerating wounded flesh, and appears capable of surviving and recovering from significant injury. Members of Species 8472 exclusively attack with their claws and raw strength; they never use a hand-held weapon, instead allowing their superior immune system to be used in an offensive role.|$|R
25|$|Jefferson {{claimed to}} have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide {{and a copy of}} Don Quixote. Linguistics played a {{significant}} role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language. He collected and understood a number of American Indian vocabularies and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian languages during their Expedition. When Jefferson removed from Washington after his presidency, he packed 50 Native American vocabulary lists in a chest and transported them on a river boat back to Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the <b>heavy</b> chest, <b>thinking</b> it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief discovered it was only filled with papers. Subsequently, 30 years of collecting were lost, with only a few fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.|$|R

In 2012, just four years after the release of Suicide Season, the album was inducted into Rocksound's Hall Of Fame. Crediting it as a significant influence on the works of Asking Alexandria, The Ghost Inside and While She Sleeps and even credited it as an influence on metalcore contemporaries Architects and The Devil Wears Prada. With clear influence noted on Architects' Hollow Crown in their incorporation of keyboards and programming, and The Devil Wears Prada's Dead Throne for its more experimental and opinion-dividing sound.|$|R
50|$|It {{was split}} into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh Hóa province, there was a {{fisherman}} named Lê Thận, who {{was not related to}} Lê Lợi in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something <b>heavy.</b> <b>Thinking</b> of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited.

Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and {{not knowing what to do}} with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, Lê Thận joined the rebel army of Lê Lợi, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited Lê Thận's home. Lê Thận's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of Lê Lợi, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. Lê Lợi held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thuận Thiên (Will of Heaven). With Lê Thận's endorsement, Lê Lợi took the blade with him.|$|E
6000|$|So Herminia gave way. Sadly {{against her}} will she gave way. One morning in early March, she absented herself from {{her place in the}} class-room without even taking leave of her beloved schoolgirls, whom she had tried so hard unobtrusively to train up towards a {{rational}} understanding of the universe around them, and sat down to write a final letter of farewell to poor straight-laced kind-hearted Miss Smith-Waters. She sat down to it with a sigh; for Miss Smith-Waters, though her outlook upon the cosmos was through one narrow chink, was a good soul up to her lights, and had been really fond and proud of Herminia. She had rather shown her off, indeed, as a social trump card to the hesitating parent,--"This is our second mistress, Miss Barton; you know her father, perhaps; such an excellent man, the Dean of Dunwich." [...] And now, Herminia sat down with a <b>heavy</b> heart, <b>thinking</b> to herself what a stab of pain the avowal she had to make would send throbbing through that gentle old breast, and how absolutely incapable dear Miss Smith-Waters could be of ever appreciating the conscientious reasons which had led her, Iphigenia-like, to her self-imposed sacrifice.|$|R
60|$|It was May-day. The sweet, caressing {{note of the}} thrush {{mingled with}} {{the music of the}} water, the dogwood and the wild plum were in festal array; but my heart was <b>heavy</b> with <b>thinking</b> of a great man who had cheapened himself. At length I came out upon a {{clearing}} where fifteen log houses marked the grant of the Federal government to Clark's regiment. Perched on a tree-dotted knoll above the last spasm of the waters in their two-mile race for peace, was a two-storied log house with a little, square porch in front of the door. As I rounded {{the corner of the house}} and came in sight of the porch I halted--by no will of my own--at the sight of a figure sunken in a wooden chair. It was that of my old Colonel. His hands were folded in front of him, his eyes were fixed but dimly on the forests of the Kentucky shore across the water; his hair, uncared for, fell on the shoulders of his faded blue coat, and the stained buff waistcoat was unbuttoned. For he still wore unconsciously the colors of the army of the American Republic.|$|R
5000|$|At 0645, lookouts on Taffy 3 ships spotted {{bursts of}} antiaircraft fire blossoming in the {{northern}} sky, as Center Force gunners opened fire on an American anti-submarine patrol plane. Moments later, Taffy 3 made both radar and visual contact with the approaching Japanese warships. Shortly before 0700, Kurita's guns opened fire on the hapless [...] "baby flattops" [...] and their comparatively tiny but incredibly courageous escorts. For more than two hours, Taffy 3's ships and planes—aided by aircraft from sister escort-carrier groups to the south—fought back with torpedoes, guns, bombs, and consummate seamanship. Then, at 0311, Kurita—shaken {{by the loss of}} three <b>heavy</b> cruisers and <b>thinking</b> that he had been fighting TF 38—ordered his remaining warships to break off the action.|$|R
5000|$|The song is a {{collaborative}} effort between Björk and LFO's Mark Bell, who was credited {{for the majority of}} the album's co-production. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Björk wrote the song in a Nord Lead synthesizer. The final version was a result of Björk and Bell's improvised jam sessions in Málaga, Spain, where the album was recorded. Björk recalls: [...] "That was me and Mark having a laugh in Spain. It was a hot day like this. We got a little amp outside and a keyboard and I just did all these really punk things, just really <b>thinking</b> <b>heavy</b> metal. Most of the tracks I wrote before Mark started on them, so they're more like song-songs, and then Mark would work on beats and arrangements with me afterwards." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{pleasant}} old {{garden on}} {{the borders of}} the lovely lake, with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and <b>heavy</b> eyes, <b>thinking</b> of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen before, the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing...|$|R
40|$|To {{get right}} to the point, let’s look beyond the {{statement}} that “the root cause of the current paralysis lies in the fundamental conceptions and perceptions which govern global society today. ” (1) It is perfectly correct that there are many bad ideas in high places, caused by obsolete <b>thinking,</b> <b>heavy</b> lobbying of special interests, and “lack of political will ” (a polite phrasing for an ill-informed electorate). But this is a symptom, and not the cause of our “intensifying problems ” and widespread political inadequacy, if not paralysis. Rather, the root cause of our problems is an obsolete, industrial-era structuring for the production and distribution of knowledge. (2) In short, massive infoglut, incoherence, and wasted knowledge. There is, in fact, no shortage of ideas, strategies, agendas, solutions, and new paradigms, as concerns the interrelated problems of employment, security, climate change, pollution, education, poverty, inequality, globalization, scarce resources, aging but growing populations, and the ever-growing proliferation of technologies that alleviate and/or aggravate these problems.

50|$|On March 24, the Japanese {{launched}} an all-out {{assault on the}} Chinese, throwing in all of their remaining planes, tanks, and infantry. The Chinese responded with mortar attacks and machine-gun fire, plus their own planes to combat the Japanese planes. The losses on both sides were <b>heavy,</b> with experts <b>thinking</b> that both sides suffered the most casualties on that day. The Japanese {{had a number of}} advantages, including tanks, superior training, and superior weapons. However, the Chinese greatly outnumbered the Japanese, due to the Chinese general, Zhu Xiang, rushing in troops at the last moment. At the end of the day, the Chinese lines held, and the Japanese attack had been repelled. After reevaluating the situation, Japanese tacticians concluded that they could not afford to suffer any more losses from what was considered to be an inconclusive battle about the trivial matter of a Chinese headquarters, and on 1 April, they began to withdraw. In haste, the Japanese left behind many of their weapons and wounded troops. They would soon be captured by the Chinese. By 19 April the withdrawal was complete, and both sides now occupied their original positions.|$|R
40|$|Back in {{the early}} 1970 s, there was a popular riddle {{entitled}} “The Boy with Two Fathers”. The content was as follows: A boy and his father are in a terrible car accident and are rushed to an emergency room. The trauma surgeon takes {{one look at the}} boy and says “Oh my God! I cannot work on this boy—he is my son!” How is this possible? I remember hearing this {{for the first time and}} sitting around doing some <b>heavy</b> and outlandish <b>thinking.</b> “One father is adoptive, the second biological. ” “One father is a sperm donor… ” etc. The simple answer, of course, is that the surgeon is the boy’s mother! In the 70 s, I never came up with the right answer on my own; neither did any of my male or female friends. If one tries this riddle on today’s students, they get the answer immediately and won’t even see it as a conundrum. All are imbued with a world-view countenancing female surgeons—we were not. Since Kant, we have come to realize that we are not mere dart boards on which perceptions impinge; that we as knowers contribute significantly to what we know—that we need a conceptual framework to order, organize and categorize the rapidly changing data provided b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Media multitasking, the {{concurrent}} {{use of multiple}} media forms, {{has been shown to}} be related to greater self-reported impulsivity and less self-control. These measures are both hallmarks of the need for immediate gratification which has been associated with fast, intuitive 2 ̆ 018 system- 12 ̆ 019 decision making, as opposed to more deliberate and effortful 2 ̆ 018 system- 22 ̆ 019 decision making. In Study 1, we used the Cognitive Reflection Task (CRT) to examine whether individuals who engage heavily in media multitasking differ from those who are light media multitaskers in their degree of system- 1 versus system- 2 thinking. In Study 2 we examined whether heavy and light media multitaskers differ in delay of gratification, using the delay discounting measure which estimates the preference for smaller immediate rewards, relative to larger delayed rewards in a hypothetical monetary choice task. We found that heavy media multitaskers were more likely than light media multitaskers to endorse intuitive, but wrong, decisions on the CRT indicating a greater reliance on 2 ̆ 018 system- 12 ̆ 019 <b>thinking.</b> <b>Heavy</b> media multitaskers were also willing to settle for less money immediately relative to light media multitaskers who were more willing to wait for the larger delayed reward. These results suggest that heavy media multitaskers have a reactive decision-making style that promotes current desires (money, ease of processing) at the expense of accuracy and future rewards. These findings highlight the potential for heavy media multitaskers to be at risk for problematic behaviors associated with delay discounting 2 ̆ 013 behaviors such as substance abuse, overeating, problematic gambling, and poor financial management...|$|R
5000|$|Heavy Duty (voiced by Keith Ferguson) - Corporal Hershel Dalton is the estranged {{cousin of}} Roadblock. Flint {{recruits}} Dalton {{to bring in}} Roadblock in exchange for membership into his Falcons team and says to Flint, [...] "Call me Heavy Duty." [...] It's revealed that Heavy Duty doesn't like Roadblock because of something that went wrong in the past. That's why Heavy Duty moved away from his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi and moved away {{to go to college}} and later live in Idaho. While on the hunt for his cousin, Heavy Duty manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and Heavy Duty handcuffs himself to Roadblock. He drags Roadblock into his vehicle which leads them into a car chase until Major Bludd blows up the bridge. Due to Major Bludd firing his laser onto the car as it was sinking, Heavy Duty loses the keys to his handcuffs. But manages to pull himself and Roadblock out of the river, however they end up in the swamp while evading alligators. Luckily, Roadblock was able to fight off the alligator by wrestling it much to the surprise of Heavy Duty. Major Bludd then attacks them in a swamp boat as Roadblock saves Heavy Duty from a large snake. After a brief fight, Roadblock and Heavy Duty try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them. While Major Bludd prepares a trap for the others, Roadblock and Heavy Duty work to get out of the handcuffs. At the same time, Heavy Duty realizes that his cousin was telling the truth when Bludd confirms that he's freelancing with Cobra. The same alligator attacks them, but Snake Eyes rescues them and scares the alligator away. Roadblock and Heavy Duty then join the other Joes in fighting off Major Bludd and the Baroness who shows up unexpectedly. After the fight, Roadblock and Heavy Duty return to their grandma's house where she revealed that their grandpa had given his inheritance to both of them, making Heavy Duty animosity towards his cousin to end. After Ripcord <b>thinking</b> <b>Heavy</b> Duty's name meant did a lot of tours of duty, it was revealed that Hershel had been nicknamed by Grandma Hinton stating when he was a baby, he could fill a diaper so fast. When Heavy Duty wonders how he's going to explain all of this to Flint, Roadblock tells him that he'll think of something.|$|R
