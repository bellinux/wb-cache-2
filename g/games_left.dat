5|$|The Indians {{lost their}} first game 5–3 against the Tigers on October 1, {{giving them a}} one-game lead with two <b>games</b> <b>left</b> to play. As a result, {{speculation}} arose {{about the possibility of}} a three-way tie.|$|E
5|$|After the 1982 season, Perkins became {{head coach}} of the University of Alabama and the Giants hired Parcells to replace him. In the coming years this change proved crucial to the Giants and Taylor. Leading up to the 1983 season, Taylor engaged in a {{training}} camp holdout that lasted three weeks and ended when he came back to the team under his old contract with three <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the preseason.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath's {{final game}} of January was a 3–1 defeat of Burton Swifts in the Birmingham Cup. They went into February with a three-point lead over Darwen, each club having only four League <b>games</b> <b>left</b> to play. Sheffield United, in third place, eight points behind with five games in hand, were the only other team with a chance of {{overtaking}} them for the divisional title.|$|E
5|$|A year later, the Red Sox {{entered the}} final {{series of the}} season at Yankee Stadium needing only one win over the Yankees {{to advance to the}} World Series. The Red Sox found {{themselves}} up by one game with two <b>games</b> <b>left</b> against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The Sox lost 5–3 {{on the last day of}} the season after falling 5–4 the previous day, resulting in the Yankees winning their 16th American League pennant. The Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series for their 12th World Championship.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3 of the 2005 season, both Pennington and {{backup quarterback}} Jay Fiedler were injured against the Jaguars. With both quarterbacks {{out for the}} season, third-string quarterback Brooks Bollinger started; the 41-year-old Testaverde was brought out of {{retirement}} to serve as his backup. Bollinger played badly in a loss in week four, and Testaverde became the starter. Testaverde had little success, and Bollinger did not fare better when he was re-inserted. Running back Curtis Martin chose to have arthroscopic surgery on his knee with four <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the season. The Jets finished 4–12.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, the Devils hired former Montreal Canadiens {{head coach}} Claude Julien to replace Lamoriello behind the bench. However, {{in the last}} week of the 2006–07 Devils season, with just three <b>games</b> <b>left,</b> Julien was fired, and Lamoriello once again reprised his {{coaching}} role. The Devils went on to win their seventh Atlantic Division title and earn the second seed in the Eastern Conference after finishing ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins by two points. They then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in the first round, but fell to the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in five. The conclusion of the series marked the end of the Devils' time at the Continental Airlines Arena.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League <b>games</b> <b>left</b> {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to steer clear of the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|Plante was the Canadiens' {{number one}} goaltender at the {{beginning}} of the 1954–55 NHL season. On March 13, 1955, with only four <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, Maurice Richard, for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was witness to the riot that followed. It began at the Forum by angry hockey game spectators and spread along Montreal's Ste. Catherine Street, causing injuries to police and fans and extensive damage to businesses and property. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the finals.|$|E

5|$|The pennant race {{continued}} {{between the}} three teams throughout the entire season. On September 25, after playing 147 games, with seven <b>games</b> <b>left</b> to play, all three teams had a record of 91–56. After each team played four more games, the Indians were up two games, meaning the Yankees and Red Sox had to win their games on September 30 {{to stay in the}} pennant race. They did, and the month of October opened up with both teams 1.5 games behind the Indians. The Indians' last series was a three-game stand against the Tigers, while the Red Sox and Yankees had a two-game series against each other.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E
5|$|Back in the League, Hollis took Charsley's {{place in}} goal, as {{customary}} in the latter's absence. The heavy ground did not suit the visitors, Grimsby Town, and the Small Heath forwards' hard-working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three. The following week, the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking ironplate-workers. Around 1,500 spectators watched a match between tinplate- and ironplate-workers' elevens, {{followed by a}} second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter, whose poor health prevented him playing, and the recently retired Small Heath forward Eddy Stanley, who led his team to a 9–3 victory. Small Heath went into March with a four-point lead over Darwen, each club having only two League <b>games</b> <b>left</b> to play, but the former's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United, in third place, ten points behind with five games in hand, were the only team still able to overhaul them.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} game of the 2014–15 season, the 7th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his {{shoulder}} ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41. With 27 <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field. The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the 4th worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four <b>games</b> <b>left</b> to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them {{at the beginning of}} March. They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it {{was announced}} that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began the}} 1975–76 Football League {{campaign}} losing 2–0 to Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Liverpool's form {{picked up in}} the second half of the season. Only one point dropped in nine late season <b>games</b> <b>left</b> them a point behind QPR going into their final match. QPR had already finished their games. Wolverhampton Wanderers were a goal up at half-time but Liverpool won 3–1 to win the League title. Liverpool exited early in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, Club Brugge scored two early goals at Anfield before Ray Kennedy, Case and a Keegan penalty fought back for a 3-2 first leg lead. Keegan's equaliser in Belgium was enough for a 4-3 aggregate win and a second Liverpool winning of that trophy.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2001–02 season, {{the club}} {{announced}} that captain Saku Koivu {{had been diagnosed}} with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and would miss the entire season. Koivu managed to return with three <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in the regular season, and along with goaltender Jose Theodore, who would win the Hart Trophy that year, led the Canadiens into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four seasons. The eighth-seeded Canadiens upset the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, and Koivu led the team in playoff scoring with 10points in 12games. In recognition of his tenacity in returning from cancer treatment, the league voted Koivu as the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner for dedication and perseverance. However, in the second round of the playoffs, the team was defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in six games. The Canadiens finished fourth in the Northeast Division in the 2002-03 season, missing the playoffs by six points. After the Habs finished with a record of 18–19–5–4 in the first 48 games of the 2002–03 season, the team replaced Therrien with Claude Julien.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez hit {{a two-run}} {{home run in}} his first Iowa home game at Principal Park on June 30, 2014. Cubs {{prospects}} Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez credited Ramirez for his help with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after {{the loss of his}} uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain as to what Ramirez would do next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.|$|E
5|$|With two <b>games</b> <b>left</b> in {{the regular}} season, the Webfoots held a one-game lead over Washington, {{with a pair of}} {{contests}} scheduled in Seattle against the Huskies. Oregon required one victory to clinch the Northern Division championship. On March 3, the Webfoots defeated Washington in {{the first game of the}} series 39–26; Gale led the team in scoring with 11 points, as the team won despite missing 53 of their 67 field goal attempts. Anet suffered a dislocated finger and was held out of the second game against Washington, which took place the following day. The Webfoots claimed a two-point win, their fourth of the season over Washington. Of the Huskies' five losses in 1938–39, all but one was against the Webfoots. By the end of the regular season, Oregon had won the PCC North Division with a 14–2 conference record, and had a 24–5 record overall.|$|E
