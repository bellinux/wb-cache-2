Descriptions of these data sets, called metadata, are seen as an important component to facilitate their access (Shah & Sheth, 1998). Most organizations have utilized some form of local or international metadata standard. To represent the diversity of the available metadata standards, a generic metadata standard is used to identify the common features from a sample of three metadata standards. The three standards are: Australia New Zealand Land Information Committee (ANZLIC) metadata standard; Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM); and Dublin Core (DC) metadata standard. These standards are presented using hierarchical <b>Directory</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Trees</b> (DITs) {{associated with}} the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). LDAP DITs are accessed using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) which is an approach of particular interest to the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) ...|$|R

5000|$|Today, most LDAP deployments, and in {{particular}} Active Directory deployments, are not interconnected into a single global naming space, and do not use national country codes {{as the basis for}} naming. Instead, these deployments follow a directory structure which at the top level mirrors that of the Domain Name System, as described by RFC 2247. For example, the entry for an organization with domain name [...] "example.com" [...] would have a distinguished name of [...] "dc=example, dc=com", and all entries in that organization's <b>directory</b> <b>information</b> <b>tree</b> would contain that distinguished name suffix.|$|E
50|$|A {{limitation}} of the original <b>directory</b> <b>information</b> <b>tree</b> structure was the assumption that applications searching for an entry in a particular organization would navigate the directory tree by first browsing to the particular country where that organization was based, then to the region where that organization was based, then locate the entry for the organization itself, and then search within that organization for the entry in question. The desire to support searching more broadly for an individual person when all the particulars of that person's location or organization were not known led to experiments in directory deployment and interconnection, such as the Common Indexing Protocol.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{concept of}} X.500 {{is that there}} is a single <b>Directory</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Tree</b> (DIT), a {{hierarchical}} organization of entries which are distributed across one or more servers, called Directory System Agents (DSA). An entry consists of a set of attributes, each attribute with one or more values. Each entry has a unique Distinguished Name, formed by combining its Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), one or more attributes of the entry itself, and the RDNs of each of the superior entries up to the root of the DIT. As LDAP implements a very similar data model to that of X.500, there is further description of the data model in the article on LDAP.|$|E

This evolved into the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol standard schema in [...] One of the most widely deployed white pages schemas used in LDAPfor representing individuals in an organizational context is inetOrgPerson, defined in , although versions of Active Directory require a different object class, User. Many large organizations havealso defined their own white pages schemas for their employees or customers, as part of their Identity management architecture. Converting between data bases and directories using different schemas is often thefunction of a Metadirectory, and data interchange standards such as Common Indexing Protocol.|$|E

40|$|Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the predomi-nant Internet {{directory}} {{access protocol}} and hence so is its use in the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This paper presents the design and implementation of LDAP component matching which enhances flexibility and security of the LDAP directory service when it {{is used for the}} PKI certificate repositories. The component match-ing together with the prerequisite ASN. 1 awareness enables match-ing against arbitrary components of certificates and enables match-ing of composite values at the abstraction layer of the underlying ASN. 1 type definition. This allows searching for certificates with matching components without the need of providing syntax spe-cific parsing and matching routines (flexibility), without the need of extracting the certificate components and storing them into sepa-rate attributes which become searchable but mutable (security), and without the need of restructuring <b>Directory</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Tree</b> (DIT) to support multiple certificates per subject (manageability and per-formance). In this paper, we describe the architecture, key data structures, and the proposed methods of enhancing interoperability and performance of our component matching implementation in the OpenLDAP open source directory software suite. We also propose the use of component matching in on-line certificate validation and in Web services security. Through performance evaluation of the OpenLDAP component matching, we show that our LDAP compo-nent matching implementation exhibits the same or higher perfor-mance compared to the previous approaches...|$|E
40|$|LDAPv 2 Client vs. the Index Mesh This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. It {{does not}} specify an Internet {{standard}} of any kind. Discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvement are requested. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1999). All Rights Reserved. LDAPv 2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 [1] have no notion on referral. The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, {{as defined by the}} Common Indexing Protocol [2], heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible way of doing this. 1. Background During the development of the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP), one of the underlying assumptions was that the interaction between clients and the Index Mesh Servers [1] would heavily depend on the passing of referrals. Protocols like LDAPv 2 [2] that lack this functionality need to compensate for it by some means. The way chosen in this memo is to add more intelligence into the client. There are two reasons behind this decision. First, this is not a major enhancement that is needed and secondly, that the intelligence when dealing with the Index Mesh, with or the knowledge about referrals, eventually has to go into the client. 2. The clients view of the Index Mesh If a LDAPv 2 client {{is going to be able}} to interact with the Index Mesh, the Mesh has to appear as something that is understandable to the client. Basically, this consists of representing the index servers and their contained indexes in a defined <b>directory</b> <b>information</b> <b>tree</b> (DIT) [3, 4] structure and a set of object classes and attribute types that have been proven to be useful in this context...|$|E
