50|$|In the {{treatment}} of sickle-cell disease, <b>hydroxycarbamide</b> increases the concentration of fetal hemoglobin. The precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, {{but it appears that}} <b>hydroxycarbamide</b> increases nitric oxide levels, causing soluble guanylyl cyclase activation with a resultant rise in cyclic GMP, and the activation of gamma globin gene expression and subsequent gamma chain synthesis necessary for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production (which does not polymerize and deform red blood cells like the mutated HbS, responsible for sickle cell disease). Adult red cells containing more than 1% HbF are termed F cells. These cells are progeny of a small pool of immature committed erythroid precursors (BFU-e) that retain the ability to produce HbF. Hydroxyurea also suppresses the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow which has a mild immunosuppressive effect particularly at vascular sites where sickle cells have occluded blood flow.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression, fevers, loss of appetite, {{psychiatric}} problems, shortness of breath, and headaches. There is also concern that {{it increases the}} risk of later cancers. Use during pregnancy is typically harmful to the baby. <b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> is in the antineoplastic family of medications. It is believed to work by blocking the making of DNA.|$|E
50|$|Non-biologic {{systemic}} treatments {{frequently used}} for psoriasis include methotrexate, ciclosporin, <b>hydroxycarbamide,</b> fumarates such as dimethyl fumarate, and retinoids. Methotrexate and ciclosporin are drugs that suppress the immune system; retinoids are synthetic forms of vitamin A. These agents are also regarded as first-line treatments for psoriatic erythroderma. Oral corticosteroids {{should not be}} used, for they can severely flare psoriasis upon their discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|The one known {{curative}} treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, but this approach involves significant risks.Other treatment options are largely supportive, {{and do not}} alter {{the course of the}} disorder (with the possible exception of ruxolitinib, as discussed below). These options may include regular folic acid, allopurinol or blood transfusions. Dexamethasone, alpha-interferon and hydroxyurea (also known as <b>hydroxycarbamide)</b> may play a role.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all those}} {{affected}} will require treatment at presentation. People are usually split up into {{low and high}} risk for bleeding/blood clotting groups (based on their age, their medical history, their blood counts and their lifestyles), low risk individuals are usually treated with aspirin, whereas those at high risk are given <b>hydroxycarbamide</b> and/or other treatments that reduce platelet count (such as interferon-α and anagrelide).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> and {{anagrelide}} are contraindicated {{during pregnancy}} and nursing. Essential thrombocytosis {{can be linked}} with a three-fold increase in risk of miscarriage. Throughout pregnancy, close monitoring of the mother and fetus is recommended. Low-dose low molecular weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin) may be used. For life-threatening complications, the platelet count can be reduced rapidly using platelet apheresis, a procedure that removes platelets from the blood and returns the remainder to the patient.|$|E

Alternate treatments used to treat corticosteroid resistant disease or for use as corticosteroid-sparing substitutes include interferon-α or its analog, Peginterferon alfa-2a, Mepolizumab (an antibody directed against IL-5), Ciclosporin (an Immunosuppressive drug), imatinib (an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases; numerous tyrosine kinase cell signaling proteins are responsible for the growth and proliferation of eosinophils {see clonal eosinophilia}), methotrexate and <b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> (both are chemotherapy and immunosuppressant drugs), and Alemtuzumab (a antibody that binds to the CD52 antigen on mature lymphocytes thereby marking them for destruction by the body).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the cost utility of imatinib compared with interferon (IFN) -alpha or <b>hydroxycarbamide</b> (hydroxyurea) for first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Design and Setting: A cost-utility (Markov) model within {{the setting of}} the UK NHS and viewed from a health system perspective was adopted. Transition probabilities and relative risks were estimated from published literature. Costs of drug treatment, outpatient care, bone marrow biopsies, radiography, blood transfusions and inpatient care were obtained from the British National Formulary and local hospital databases. Costs (Lstg, year 2001 - 03 values) were discounted at 6 %. Quality-of-life (QOL) data were obtained from the published literature and discounted at 1. 5 %. The main outcome measure was cost per QALY gained. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses were performed along with probabilistic (stochastic) analysis. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, was Lstg 26 _ 180 per QALY gained (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from Lstg 19 _ 449 to Lstg 51 _ 870) and compared with <b>hydroxycarbamide</b> was Lstg 86 _ 934 per QALY (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from Lstg 69 _ 701 to Lstg 147 _ 095) [Lstg 1 = $US 1. 691 = _ 1. 535 as at 31 December 2002]. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 50 % of the ICERs for imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, fell below a threshold of approximately Lstg 31 _ 000 per QALY gained. Fifty percent of ICERs for imatinib, compared with <b>hydroxycarbamide,</b> fell below approximately Lstg 95 _ 000 per QALY gained.

40|$|International audienceEssential thrombocythaemia (ET) is an {{acquired}} myeloproliferative disorder with a prolonged clinical course and a near-normal life expectancy. Therapy is stratified according to risk of thrombohaemorrhagic events. In high-risk patients, platelet reduction is generally recommended. In intermediate-risk patients, therapy {{should be considered}} depending on the severity of associated risk factors, especially cardiovascular. In low-risk patients, a watch-and-wait approach is appropriate. <b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> is generally first-line therapy. Concerns for possible leukemogenicity make anagrelide or interferon-α possible choices in younger patients {{and those who are}} resistant or intolerant to <b>hydroxycarbamide.</b> Each pharmacotherapy is associated with specific long-term risks and benefits. The potential risk of major bleeding is the main drawback of aspirin. <b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> is an established, effective drug for ET, but it may increase the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and may give mucocutaneous ulcers. Anagrelide is a licensed treatment that also reduces platelet counts and is generally well tolerated, with evidence that some common side effects diminish over time. Anagrelide can have cardiac effects due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase III and therefore requires cautious use in patients with cardiac insufficiency. There is no evidence of leukaemogenicity with anagrelide or interferon-α therapy. Interferon-α is the only treatment suitable for use during pregnancy, although it is not licensed in ET. While it is effective for platelet reduction, the use of interferon-α is restricted by psychiatric side effects.

40|$|Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a {{myeloproliferative}} neoplasm {{characterized by}} an increase in blood platelets and dominated by a predisposition to vascular events. Cutaneous manifestations can complicate its course. itching has been the most common symptom reported; however, the percentage has ranged from 3 % to 46 %, depending on the survey. Erythromelalgia is found in 6 % of cases, and livedo reticularis, minor bleeding, acrocyanosis, and Raynaud's phenomenon are rare manifestations. It is important to recognize and treat these events, because they can affect patients' quality of life and could worsen the prognosis. In addition to skin involvement as a possible sign of ET, the treatment of ET can be associated with cutaneous complications. <b>Hydroxycarbamide,</b> interferon-alfa, and anagrelide can induce different skin lesions. <b>Hydroxycarbamide</b> has been associated with major complications, including painful leg ulcers and actinic keratoses.
