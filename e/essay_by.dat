5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding <b>essay</b> <b>by</b> Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E

5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an <b>essay</b> <b>by</b> E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a throwback to the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an <b>essay</b> <b>by</b> literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an <b>essay</b> <b>by</b> Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E
