5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton {{had to settle for}} the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which he was able to acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E

50|$|He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 17 November 1581, and was {{admitted}} {{a student of}} the Inner Temple in 1583. Subsequently he was collector of customs at Exmouth. He succeeded his father on 27 June 1597, and in July of that year <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> at his own cost {{to take part in the}} Islands Voyage under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. He was High Sheriff of Devon in 1600, and was knighted in the same year.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Hedge & Bayard {{became one}} of the firms under {{contract}} with the Continental Congress to supply the Continental Army. John himself <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> sent <b>out</b> as <b>a</b> privateer. But, in the fall of 1777, the British occupied Philadelphia. Bayard moved his family to a farm at Plymouth, and took to the field with his regiment. They fought at the Battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Princeton. John was cited by General Washington for his gallant leadership in the Battle of Princeton.|$|R
60|$|On {{his arrival}} in England, therefore, Captain Phips {{solicited}} the king to let him have another vessel and send him back again to the West Indies. But King James, who had probably expected that the Rose Algier would return laden with gold, refused to have anything {{more to do with}} the affair. Phips might never have been able to renew the search if the Duke of Albemarle and some other noblemen had not lent their assistance. They <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> and gave the command to Captain Phips. He sailed from England, and arrived safely at Porto de la Plata, where he took an adze and assisted his men to build a large boat.|$|R

60|$|Awakened now to {{the danger}} that menaced the {{establishment}} at Astoria, and {{aware of the importance}} of protecting this foothold of American commerce and empire on the shores of the Pacific, the government determined to send the frigate Adams, Captain Crane, upon this service. On hearing of this determination, Mr. Astor immediately proceeded to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> called the Enterprise, to sail in company with the Adams, freighted with additional supplies and reinforcements for Astoria.|$|E
60|$|It happened, {{being in}} company with some merchants and {{planters}} of my acquaintance, and talking {{of those things}} very earnestly, three of them came to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy, {{they told me that}} they had a mind to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question was whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should have my equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the stock.|$|E

50|$|Again, Stucley was acquitted, and the {{authorities}} released him in October 1569. He had been suspected of proposing {{an invasion of}} Ireland to King Philip II of Spain, and soon after his release he offered his services to Fénelon, the French ambassador in London. He returned to Ireland in 1570, where he <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> at Waterford and made a great show of his piety, proceeding {{through the streets of}} the city on his knees as he offered himself up to God. He then sailed from Waterford on 17 April, supposedly for London, but his real destination was Vimeiro, northwest of Lisbon. He had 28 men on board, but only the sole Italian knew their course, and the rest fell into despair when they arrived in Portugal after a five-day voyage.|$|R

60|$|Wealth now accumulating on me, and {{uncommon}} success crowning my prosperous labours, I {{might have}} rested happy in that middle state of life {{my father had}} so often recommended, yet nothing would content me, such was my evil genius, but I must leave this happy station, for a foolish ambition in rising; and thus, once more, I cast myself into the greatest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into. Having lived four years in Brazil, I had net only learned the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvadore; to whom, once, by way of discourse, having given account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea and the manner of trading there for mere trifles, by which we furnish our plantations with Negroes, they gave such attention to what I said, that three of them came one morning to me, and told me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me to secrecy (it being an infringement on {{the powers of the}} Kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> to go to Guinea, in order to stock the plantation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly sold, they would divide among them: and if I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part, I should have ah equal share of the Negroes, without providing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in another condition. But I, born to be my own destroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accepted the offer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good friend the captain, as my universal heir; but obliged him to dispose of my effects as directed, one half of the produce to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.|$|E
5|$|In November 1811, Emerald {{sailed to}} Portsmouth and was laid up in ordinary. <b>Fitted</b> <b>out</b> as <b>a</b> {{receiving}} <b>ship</b> in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.|$|R
50|$|Excommunicated and ejected, Blair, {{along with}} others, <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> {{intending}} {{to go to}} New England in 1635. But the weather proved so bad that they were beaten back, and, returning to Scotland, he lived partly in that country and partly in England. Orders were issued in England for his apprehension in 1637, but he escaped to Scotland, and preached for some time in Ayr. He was invited to go to France as chaplain to the regiment of Colonel Patrick Hepburn of Waughton, but after embarking at Leith he was threatened by a soldier whom he had reproved for swearing, and went ashore again. He also petitioned the privy council 'for liberty to preach the gospel,' and received an appointment at Burntisland in April 1638. He was nominated to St. Andrews in the same year, and was admitted there on 8 October 1639.|$|R

6000|$|As {{the boys}} were still uneasy as to the opinion Francis Vere might form of their {{continued}} stay in England, they wrote to him, their letter being inclosed in one from the earl; but the reply set their minds at rest -- [...] "By all means stay in England," [...] Captain Vere wrote, [...] "since there is nothing doing here of any note or consequence, nor likely to be.

Unfortunately we are soldiers and must obey orders; but as you are as yet only volunteers, free to act as you choose, it would be foolish in the extreme for you to come over to this dull place while there is so much going on in England.
