25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is <b>flocculated</b> and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E

At the flask level, K 2 HPO 4, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, and aeration variables positively affected the Pestan production, DCW (dry cell weight), apparent viscosity, and <b>flocculating</b> activity response.

40|$|Bioflocculants are <b>flocculating</b> {{substances}} {{produced by}} microorganisms during growth and have recently received considerable attention from researchers; {{due to their}} biodegradability, non-toxicity and lack of secondary pollution from degradation intermediates. This study evaluated the efficiency of bioflocculant produced by Bacillus sp. AEMREG 4 isolated from Tyhume River. The bacterial identification was through 16 S rDNA sequencing; nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank as Bacillus sp. AEMREG 4 with an Accession number KP 406729. The optimum culture conditions for bioflocculant production were an inoculum size of 4 % (v/v) and starch as well as yeast extract as sole carbon and nitrogen sources respectively. The addition of CaCl 2 enhanced the <b>flocculating</b> activity, at {{a wide range of}} pH 4 - 10 and the highest <b>flocculating</b> activity was reached at an initial pH 8 (80 %). A bioflocculant yield of 0. 78 g was recovered from 1 L of culture broth. The optimum <b>flocculating</b> activity of 78 % was reached at the lowest bioflocculant dosage of 0. 1 mg/ml and the presence of divalent cations (Ca 2 +, Mn 2 + and Mg 2 +) as well as a trivalent cation (Al 3 +) enhanced <b>flocculating</b> activity. The purified bioflocculant retained more than 70 % <b>flocculating</b> activity when subjected to heating at 100 °C for 1 h and maximum <b>flocculating</b> activity of 83 % was achieved at both acidic and basic pH values of 3 and 10 respectively. Chemical analysis showed that the bioflocculant is predominantly polysaccharide. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and methoxyl groups as the functional moieties and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of the purified bioflocculant showed its morphological structure as rod-shaped which contributes to its high <b>flocculating</b> efficiency.

40|$|In recent years, several novel cation-independent bioflocculants {{have been}} reported, which {{can avoid the}} {{secondary}} contamination caused by addition of cations. However, compared with cation-dependent bioflocculants, the <b>flocculating</b> mechanism of cation-independent bioflocculants is largely unknown. In this study, a cation-independent bioflocculant MBF-W 6 produced by Chryseobacterium daeguense W 6 {{was used as a}} model to investigate the <b>flocculating</b> mechanism. The results showed that the major <b>flocculating</b> component of MBF-W 6 is a complex of proteins and polysaccharides.

These results are consistent with the fact that MBF-W 6 is a cation-independent bioflocculant. Further scanning electron microscopic observation showed that MBF-W 6 induced flocs formed tight packed structure, suggesting that the kaolin clay particles maybe directly attached and bridged by bioflocculant MBF-W 6. In addition, we also found out that Fe 3 + ions inhibit the <b>flocculating</b> activity of MBF-W 6 by affecting –COO− and –NH groups.

30|$|Polysaccharide bioflocculant {{generally}} has {{the advantages of}} high <b>flocculating</b> activity and good thermal stability. However, the <b>flocculating</b> activity of polysaccharide bioflocculant rapidly declines in late fermentation stages. Many polysaccharide bioflocculant-producing strains, including Virgibacillus sp. (Cosa et al. 2011), Bacillus firmus (Salehizadeh and Shojaosadati 2002) and Enterobacter aerogenes (Lu et al. 2005), behave in this manner. Intracellular or extracellular glucoside hydrolase partially or completely hydrolyses the polysaccharide chain (Meng et al. 2015), which could affect the active components of flocculant and result in a decline of <b>flocculating</b> activity. β-Glucosidase was probably a related enzyme that caused {{the loss of the}} <b>flocculating</b> activity because of the hydrolysis of the non-reduced end of the cello-oligosaccharide involved in flocculation or because of the relief of substrate inhibition of other cellulases. However, the activity of β-glucosidase was maintained at a low level when sucrose was replaced as the carbon source by glucose. At the same time, the <b>flocculating</b> activity increased continuously in the late stages, instead of decreasing. The result showed that β-glucosidase might be inhibited by glucose in the medium without significantly affecting polysaccharide flocculant activity. This phenomenon was also reported in the transformation of cellulose into glucose (Tokuda et al. 2009). As the glucose concentration in product increased, the activity of β-glucosidase was inhibited, resulting in reduced cellulose degradation. We therefore inferred that β-glucosidase was involved in the degradation of polysaccharide bioflocculant.|$|R
