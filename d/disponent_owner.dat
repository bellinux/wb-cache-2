Objašnjavaju se razlozi donošenja i formuliranja pojedinih propisa te predlažu rješenja de lege ferenda Članak daje uporedni prikaz hrvatskih propisa i sudske prakse s onima engleske i američke te se zalaže za harmonizaciju hrvatskog pomorskog prava s pravima pomorskopravno razvijenih zemalja. The article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the development of Croatian maritime law in the areas related to liability for death and personal injury of crew, such as: (i) entities liable on the ship’s side (Who is liable?); (ii) jurisdiction (Where to sue?); (iii) basis of liability (On what ground may a crewmember claim?); (iv) direct action (May a crewmember sue the liability insurer?); and (v) mediation and arbitration (How to efficiently resolve disputes?). The Croatian Maritime Code (CMC) provides that operator (<b>disponent</b> <b>owner),</b> ship’s manager, company under ISM Code and employer are jointly and severally liable for the crew claims. The article suggests that the ship owner should be added to the list. CMC provides that Croatian courts shall have jurisdiction for crewmember claims if the claimant has domicile in Croatia. The article argues that general principles contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters should be applied combined with a forum non conveniens provision for cases where non EU countries are involved. CMC provides that the ship operator (and others) are liable for crew claims if they are at fault, or if the death or injury is caused by a hazardous thing or activity, or by a lack of safety measures at work, when they are strictly liable under provisions of the general law on liability for hazardous things or activities. The article suggests that the ship operator (and others) are liable for the fault of their employees as well, and that strict liability is imposed independently of the general law with defence of contributory negligence of the claimant...|$|E

40|$|The Commercial Court’s recent {{decision}} in Progress Bulk Carriers Ltd v Tube City IMS LLC (The Cenk Kaptanoglu) {{is an interesting}} example of economic duress founded (in part) on a lawful threat. The claimants in this case were the <b>disponent</b> <b>owners</b> of the vessel Cenk Kaptanoglu. On 2 April 2009, they chartered the vessel to the respondent-charterers for the carriage of shredded scrap but delivered the vessel to a third party shortly thereafter. This constituted a repudiatory breach of the charterparty, which was not accepted by the charterers {{even though there was}} then no realistic chance of the Cenk Kaptanoglu’s fulfilling the charter. Conceding their error, the owners promised to provide an alternative vessel and compensate the charterers for their loss. A substitute vessel (the Agia) was subsequently identified, but by that time it was clear that a delay in shipment could not be avoided. The charterers then sought, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a discount on the freight as a condition for accepting the Agia and the late shipment. On 28 April 2009, the owners made a “take it or leave it” offer, requiring the charterers to accept the Agia at a $ 2 per metric ton discount and waive all claims connected to the owners’ repudiatory breach. The charterers eventually agreed under protest...|$|R
