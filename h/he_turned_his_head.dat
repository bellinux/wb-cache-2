500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
2500|$|Kuti {{does not}} {{remember}} when Margaryan returned, but {{early in the}} morning he felt that someone had turned on the light. He thought it was Gurgen returning to the room, but after hearing some muffled sounds, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away from the wall and saw Safarov standing by Margaryan's bed with a long axe in his hands: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid picturesâ€”many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced up}} at her, and their eyes met, nor could <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hist!" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> aside slightly, in a {{listening}} attitude, {{while his}} comrades suddenly ceased their noisy laugh.|$|R
60|$|Wolf's trot {{broke into}} a run. Wider and wider were the leaps he made. Not once did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>his</b> wolf's brush {{standing}} out straight behind him. He cut sharply across {{the curve of the}} trail and was gone.|$|R
2500|$|Within {{one second}} of each other, President Kennedy, Governor Connally, and Mrs. Kennedy all turned {{abruptly}} from looking to their left to looking to their right, between Zapruder film frames 155 and 169. Connally, like the President, was a World War II military veteran but unlike him, a longtime hunter. Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not see the President, so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired. The doctor who operated on Connally measured his head {{at the time he was}} hit as turned 27 degrees left of center. After Connally was hit he shouted, [...] "Oh, no, no, no. My God. They're going to kill us all!" ...|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} {{suddenly}} immovable. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very slightly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at me for a moment reflectively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, den, sah," [...] said Grandison, [...] "p'raps 'twas akerns; but, anyway, afore {{he was out}} ob de woods he see a big, ole bar a-comin' {{straight}} 'long to him. De 'possum he ain't got no time ter climb a tree an' git out on de leetlest end ob a long limb, an' so he lay hese'f flat down on de groun' an' make b'lieve he's dead.

60|$|Coulthurst {{sat with}} a big hand clenched {{on the table and}} a grim look in his face when Sewell left him, nor did <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> until Grace, who came softly out of the inner room, sat down close by him.|$|R
50|$|The depicts Absalon as a {{military}} commander, mounted on a rearing horse, wearing a mail and helmet, holding an axe in his right hand. The statue faces Christiansborg Palace on Slotsholmen, where Absalon's bishop's castle once stood, but <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the right, looking {{in the direction of}} Copenhagen City Hall.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{touched his}} arm almost imperiously as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and the hickory-nut cracked {{into a wide}} smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} fixedly at the speaker {{for a few}} moments without answering.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> {{and rode}} slowly back to Bou Saada.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{arranging}} his reflections betwixt {{speech and}} thought, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> up the path.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had not <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at {{the opening}} or closing of the door, but {{presently}} another sound broke the silence. It was a woman's sob, and as <b>he</b> slowly <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> a tall, graceful figure moved forward out of the shadows, and he heard his name softly murmured.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned forward}} and looked at him. Unwillingly <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to meet her gaze.|$|E
60|$|After he {{had taken}} some half-dozen spoonfuls <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on the pillow and fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{toward the}} little orchestra, which {{was playing a}} low and tremulous waltz tune.|$|E
5000|$|The Mirror Stage {{has also}} a {{significant}} symbolic dimension. The Symbolic order {{is present in the}} figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as <b>his</b> own, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> toward this adult who represents the big Other, as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, [...] "L'angoisse", 1962-1963) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next one}} {{has no such}} courage. Collapsed altogether, he has nothing more to say for himself or his creed. Giotto hangs the cloak upon him, in Ghirlandajo's fashion, as from a peg, but with ludicrous narrowness of fold. Literally, he is a 'shut-up' Magus--closed like a fan. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> away, hopelessly. And the last Magus shows nothing but his back, disappearing through the door.|$|R
60|$|Already <b>he</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slowly {{round to}} watch that fast disappearing three-decker, gleaming golden now in the distant haze.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{from the}} light and {{presently}} Kit, hearing him breathe quietly, went out on deck.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{towards her}} and {{regarded}} her critically, as though making some test of her sincerity.|$|E
60|$|The {{familiar}} {{curtain rings}} awakened Benham. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over, stared {{for a moment}} and then remembered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will consider, then,' said Mr. Raunham, sensibly moved. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>head,</b> bade them a warm adieu, {{and left}} the door.|$|R
60|$|Two {{hours later}} they saw, from their hiding place, Nicholson ride {{out from the}} lane. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> horse's <b>head</b> in their direction.|$|R
5000|$|Joel's [...] "sleepy eyed" [...] persona was {{reportedly}} {{the result of}} Hodgson staying up all night working non-stop on the pilot, which was kept after the pilot was shot because the crew and other performers thought it was funny. Off-camera, Hodgson wears eyeglasses, which were occasionally seen when <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in profile during scenes in the theater, but was very frequently seen in the Kickstarter videos and other promotional appearances.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} there came a crash of steel from the left, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at {{the sound}} of the biscuit tin and watched her put out the {{precious}} discs.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He {{had been}} {{standing}} {{with his back to}} the window, and Zoe had been facing it.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> would <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and watch}} the child away, and say to Florence, 'We don't want any others, do we? Kiss me, Floy.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the framing}} story, when the Joker asks if anyone else {{wanted to tell}} their anecdote, Killer Croc slams his fist on the table, {{demanding}} <b>his</b> <b>turn.</b> <b>He</b> states that he threw a rock at Batman during a battle in a quarry. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> waiting {{for some sort of}} appreciation, but the other villains stare {{at him for a moment}} and continue telling their stories, while Croc mutters, [...] "It was a big rock." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Martha at the door. I saw her haggard, {{listening}} face distinctly. My dread was lest <b>he</b> should <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and see her}} too.|$|R
