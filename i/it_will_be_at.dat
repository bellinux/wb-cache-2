25|$|Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele {{initiated}} a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B.subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, B.subg. Isostylis {{has been set}} aside. If maintained at all in Mast and Thiele's forthcoming arrangement, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a lesser rank than subgenus.|$|E
25|$|Compliance - this is {{a measure}} of the amount in angle or {{distance}} that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.|$|E

25|$|In {{preparation}} for the event, municipal authorities {{on both sides of}} the border met to discuss the long-term economic impact of the event, and how to capitalize efficiently on the large number of tourists expected at the Falls when it was held. The event was expected to bring in millions of dollars in tourist revenue {{on both sides of the}} border. The Niagara Parks Commission has stated <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least twenty years before another major stunt is approved.|$|E
25|$|A sonar {{target is}} small {{relative}} to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, {{the power of the}} reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000W/m2 signal at 1m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2signal. At 100m the signal will be 1W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10m2 target, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> 0.001W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001W/m2 until 300m. Any 10m2 target between 100 and 300m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).|$|E

2500|$|The {{explosion}} and resulting fire caused a full plant shutdown, reducing Western Australia's {{supply of energy}} by up to 35%. Apache's managing director, Tim Wall, said, [...] "It's pretty easy {{to say there is}} a lot of damage here and we are looking at alternatives to try to get gas to market as soon as possible but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least several months before we have partial sales." [...] He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational. [...] Approximately 80-90% of the island's gas is used by industrial customers, with small amounts provided to Synergy, the state's largest electricity retailer.|$|E
