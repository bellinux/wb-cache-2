40|$|Externally {{pressurized}} gas-lubricated bearings {{with multiple}} <b>orifice</b> <b>feed</b> are investigated. An analytical treatment is developed for a semi-cylindrical bearing with 9 orifices {{and for a}} cylindrical journal bearing with 192 radial and 24 axial orifices. Experiments are described on models of the two bearing configurations with specially designed fixtures which incorporate pneumatic loading and means for determining pressure profiles, gas flow and gap height. The correlation between theory and experiment is satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Note:Bubble size {{distributions}} play {{an important}} role in heat and mass transfer operations and reactions in fluidized beds. Knowledge of bubble formation is necessary to provide a boundary condition for the bubble interaction model developed in this department. In the present experiments, the frequency of bubble formation at a single orifice in fluidized beds and in aqueous sugar solution has been measured by a low pressure transducer and by analysis of cine-films. The regularity of bubble formation has been studied by recording frequency spectra with a wave analyzer. Four different orifice sizes have been used (0. 16 cm - 0. 63 cm) with orifice flow rates varying, 3 from 20 - 110 cm Is. The volume of the chamber <b>feeding</b> the <b>orifice</b> has also been varied between 50 cm - 4800 cm [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A hydraulic shaker applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high speed coupling with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with <b>feed</b> <b>orifices</b> located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger operating clearances and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates. For most applications, a compromise of bearing performance parameters will be desired. The test results and comparisons presented will aid in sizing orifice diameters for future hybrid thrust bearing designs...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principle}} {{consists of a}} continuous phase fluid (focusing or sheath fluid) flanking or surrounding the dispersed phase (focused or core fluid), so as to give rise to droplet or bubble break-off {{in the vicinity of}} an orifice through which both fluids are extruded. The principle may be extended to two or more coaxial fluids; gases and liquids may be combined; and, depending of the geometry of the <b>feed</b> tube and <b>orifices,</b> the flow pattern may be cylindrical or planar. Both cylindrical and planar flow focusing have led to a variety of developments (see also the works of Peter Walzal).|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} turbomachinery often experiences severe {{dynamic loads}} that produce large amplitude rotor motions. Well-engineered squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide adequate damping to ameliorate rotor vibrations {{and to ensure}} system reliability. Open ends SFDs are prone to air ingestion during large amplitude rotor whirl motions and high excitation frequencies, all the while demanding of a significant flowrate, an undesirable operating feature. Piston ring (PR) end seals are commonly installed in SFDs in aircraft engines to amplify the available damping while reducing the demand of oil flowrate and also to avoid air ingestion. This dissertation investigates experimentally the dynamic forced performance of a SFD with a short land length (L/D= 0. 2), nominal clearance 0. 254 mm and lubricant supplied via three <b>orifice</b> <b>feed</b> holes (?= 2. 5 mm). There are two configurations, one has its ends open to ambient while the other has sealed ends with PRs. The dynamic load tests are of three types (single frequency, sine-sweep frequency dynamic loads and impact loads). Single frequency dynamic load tests reveal that the piston ring end seals effectively reduce leakage through {{the ends of the}} film land; thus the sealed SFD provides 11 - 13 times more damping coefficient and eleven times more added mass coefficients than those provided by an open ends SFD configuration. Further tests of two PR sealed ends SFDs (one with a seal flow conductance = 0. 56 LPM/bar, and the other with = 0. 89 LPM/bar) operated at a supply pressure Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg, show that small differences on their damping and added mass coefficients are within the measurement uncertainty range. The second pair of piston rings (Cave-S 2 >Cave-S 1) has a larger slit gap than the first pair, hence providing a lesser flow resistance. The effect of lubricant supply pressure on the sealed ends SFD force coefficients is also quantified experimentally by increasing the lubricant supply pressure by a factor of four (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg?Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg). For the sealed ends SFD with Cave-S 1 and Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg, both the damping and added mass coefficients show a ~ 20 % increase compared to those coefficients from the damper supplied with a low oil feed pressure (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg). Further experiments with the sine-sweep frequency dynamic load tests aim to validate the SFD force coefficients identified from a single-frequency dynamic load. The estimated SFD damping and inertia force coefficients from a sine-sweep frequency load tests with a low time rate of change in sine-sweep excitation frequency ?= 6. 5 Hz/s agree with the coefficients obtained from a single-frequency dynamic load over the same test conditions while substantially reducing the time of data collection. Furthermore, single impact load tests are performed to quantify their effect on the response of an elastically supported open ends SFD and sealed ends SFD. Test system transient responses due to a single impact show the peak amplitude of motion (ZMAX) is proportional to the magnitude of applied load (FMAX). The identified system damping ratio (?) is proportional to the peak dynamic displacement as a linear system shows. The dissertation discloses the full detail of the test dampers geometry and the experimental results which will provide a design reference to the practitioners...|$|R
