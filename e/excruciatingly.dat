25|$|The cornea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} tissues of the body, as it is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibres via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve by way of 70–80 long ciliary nerves. Research suggests the density of pain receptors in the cornea is 300-600 times greater than skin and 20-40 times greater than dental pulp, making any injury to the structure <b>excruciatingly</b> painful.|$|E
25|$|Hemipepsis ustulata {{and fellow}} members of its tribe of Pepsini {{tarantula}} hawks {{are well known}} for the aposematic coloration. They range from shiny black to blue-black with bright yellow, orange, or red wings – classic warning colors warning experienced predators to stay away and keeping naïve predators wary. Tarantula hawks also emit an aposematic odor, which deters predators. Such a foul odor, associated with an <b>excruciatingly</b> painful sting, makes a strong impression on predators, keeping them away.|$|E
25|$|The <b>excruciatingly</b> taxing touring {{commitments}} that followed took the band {{as far as}} South America, but understandably left them physically and creatively exhausted. The band began to fall apart around this time. Founding member Roberto Fioretti left the band after the recording of the album as he wanted {{to spend more time}} with his family and was replaced by Andreas Herz, who never played any official release. In 1994, Reil left as well, leaving Petrozza the sole original band member. Reil was replaced by Joe Cangelosi. Herz left in 1995 and was replaced by Christian Giesler. To make matters worse, their contract with Epic was dropped. Now on G.U.N. Records, the new lineup put out the album Cause for Conflict that year. The result was their most modern album at that time, the sound on this album had influences from Pantera and Machine Head, a slight return to a harsher sound than on the previous album.|$|E

[...] Michael Tanner's view was similar.|$|E

500|$|Radiohead found touring {{stressful}} {{and took}} a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be <b>excruciatingly</b> boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E
500|$|Slaughterhouse-Five {{received}} generally positive reviews, with Michael Crichton {{writing in}} The New Republic, [...] "he {{writes about the}} most <b>excruciatingly</b> painful things. His novels have attacked our deepest fears of automation and the bomb, our deepest political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists." [...] The book went immediately {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list. Vonnegut's earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of Slaughterhouse-Five resonated with a generation marked by the Vietnam War. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed for an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.|$|E

The Washington Posts Richard Harrington wrote that [...] "There's no shortage of soaring, dynamic rockers on 'The Open Door,' including 'Sweet Sacrifice,'" [...] among others.

500|$|Dorian Lynskey of Blender wrote, [...] "Although a few tracks retain Felt Mountains eerie beauty, Black Cherrys {{natural habitat}} is less supper club than strip club, and Goldfrapp sound right at home." [...] Andy Hermann of PopMatters viewed Black Cherry as [...] "a weird, edgy album, {{the work of}} two doggedly {{maverick}} talents chasing their muses wherever they take them". Wes May of About.com dubbed it a [...] "rare electronica album of warmth and depth" [...] and {{found it to be}} [...] "the ultimate chillout pleasure". Drowned in Sound's Gen Williams expressed that the album's [...] "crystalline, neon-edged beauty, its pulsing army of beats and Alison's lush, lethargically versatile vocals, swinging between sultry and seraphic throughout, make it—for now at least—a largely satisfying record that indicates imminent and deserved success for Goldfrapp." [...] In a mixed review, Heather Phares of AllMusic commended Goldfrapp for their [...] "artistic risk-taking", but felt that the album [...] "sounds unbalanced, swinging between delicate, deceptively icy ballads and heavier, dance-inspired numbers without finding much of a happy medium between them." [...] Michael Idov of Pitchfork criticised the duo's switch to electro music, while describing Black Cherry as [...] "a soundtrack to <b>excruciatingly</b> banal seduction".|$|E
500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and <b>excruciatingly</b> bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1989, Chahi was {{impressed}} by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of Dragon's Lair had and thought that {{it would be possible to}} use vector outlines to create a similar effect using much less computer storage. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in C, he turned to assembly language. He wrote a polygon routine for the Motorola 68000 on an Atari ST to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a frame rate of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as [...] "a major turning point in the creation of the game" [...] and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work. He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's genlock capabilities to create rotoscoped animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called [...] "pixigons") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on Deluxe Paint artwork, the process of creating them was <b>excruciatingly</b> slow, and he returned to using bitmapped images.|$|E
500|$|Raimi and {{the studio}} clashed {{several times during}} production. The first {{disagreement}} between the director and the executives stemmed from the latter's insistence on casting a [...] "Hollywood" [...] actor in the lead role instead of Raimi's long-time collaborator and friend Campbell. In his 2002 autobiography If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor, Campbell commented about {{how difficult it was}} working with more established producers; [...] "jumping into the big time meant dealing with the <b>excruciatingly</b> specific and alternately vague demands of a studio,... Hollywood executives took an interest in everything." [...] Campbell was surprised that he had to audition for the lead role, as {{he did not have to}} test for The Evil Dead. [...] Campbell and his photographer friend Mike Ditz used a 16 mm film camera and shot a scene to show to the producers. Upon viewing it, the producers asserted that [...] "Campbell will not star in this film". [...] In retaliation, Raimi lengthened a supporting role and gave it to Campbell: the character of Renaldo [...] "The Heel". This allowed for Campbell to be present through the production.|$|E
500|$|In Nappalli, the {{appellant}} {{was dismissed}} from an educational institution for {{his refusal to}} participate in the aforementioned acts. Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15. However, the Court held that since [...] "religion" [...] in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to [...] "a citizen's faith in a personal God" [...] and does not include [...] "a system of belief in one's own country", the acts in question were not religious practices. Hence, the appellant's rights had not been contravened. The Court took the view that [...] "the appellant's interpretation of the pledge and anthem ceremony as a religious ceremony was a distortion of secular fact into religious belief". If the appellant's interpretation was correct, this would result in Article 15(1) losing operative effect, for [...] "ow can the same Constitution guarantee religious freedom if, by asking citizens to pledge their allegiance to country, it is (as the appellant suggests) coercing participation in a religious ceremony? This <b>excruciatingly</b> absurd interpretation cannot have been what was envisaged by the authors of the Constitution." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2006, Yankovic {{began working}} on the album's parodies. During these sessions, three parodies were recorded; the first of these, [...] "Canadian Idiot", is a play on [...] "American Idiot" [...] by Green Day. It is a satirical {{commentary}} on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians. The song is ironic, and Yankovic has stated that the song's anger is a joke and that he loves Canada. Next, Yankovic {{began working on}} [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru", a parody of R. Kelly's [...] "Trapped in the Closet". Yankovic was inspired to pen the spoof after hearing the [...] "brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous" [...] original. Efforts to make the parody more convoluted than the original were first considered but then abandoned by Yankovic; he eventually reasoned, however, {{that he could make}} his version [...] "a little more stupid". Thus, the song is an <b>excruciatingly</b> detailed narrative about a couple getting hamburgers at the drive-thru, which was [...] "the most banal thing [...] could think of at the time." [...] Because the song was three times the length of a normal song, legally, Yankovic would have been required to pay thrice the statutory rate for royalties. This in turn would have forced Yankovic to remove one of his parodies from the album. However, R. Kelly allowed Yankovic to only pay the royalty rate for one song. To round out the first session, Yankovic recorded [...] "Confessions Part III", a play on [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] by Usher. The song purports to be a continuation of the Usher songs [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II", focusing on trivial, silly, strange, and disturbing confessions; Yankovic explained that, [...] "After hearing Usher do , I couldn’t help but think that maybe he’d left a few things out, that there were a few confessions he had yet to make." ...|$|E
500|$|Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized {{accounts}} of the book's creation in two articles, [...] "How Orlo Got His Book" [...] in The New York Times Book Review and [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language" [...] in the Chicago Tribune, both published on November 17, 1957. In [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a [...] "distinguished schoolbook publisher" [...] {{to write a book}} for young children about [...] "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below". The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, [...] "you can't use the word scaling. You can't use the word peaks. You can't use Everest. You can't use 60. You can't use degrees. You can't..." [...] Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. In [...] "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the [...] "three <b>excruciatingly</b> painful weeks" [...] in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, [...] "queen" [...] was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter [...] "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter [...] "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.|$|E

2500|$|The Temple Institute {{has created}} a life-sized menorah, {{designed}} by goldsmith Chaim Odem, intended {{for use in a}} future Third Temple.

[...] The menorah is made of one talent (interpreted as 45kg) of 24 karat pure gold, hammered out of a single block of solid gold, with decorations based on the depiction of the original in the Arch of Titus and the Temple Institute's interpretation of the relevant religious texts.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} disliked the film. Michael Carter of The Breeze {{summed up the}} film as [...] "all right", though denouncing its {{reliance}} on [...] "cheap jump scares and an even cheaper 'found footage' style". David Stratton of the Australian television series At the Movies said that [...] "it was extremely unthrilling, very obvious, very clichéd. We've seen it all before." [...] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called it [...] "an <b>excruciatingly</b> tedious YouTube gag cleverly marketed to go viral". Bill Gibron of PopMatters listed the film as the second worst horror film of all time, writing that it lacked [...] "anything remotely redeeming for the seasoned fright fan", and was [...] "a waste of time in both concept and execution".|$|E
2500|$|A more mixed review from Karina Longworth of The Village Voice said: [...] "We get {{a fairly}} typical Hollywood {{flattening}} of history, with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail, giving the film {{two out of}} four stars, said: [...] "Typically, this sort of film is an earnest tear-jerker with moments of levity. Instead, {{what we have here}} is a raucous rib-tickler with occasional pauses for a little dramatic relief." [...] Referring to the film as a [...] "big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum", The New York Times noted that [...] "save for Ms. Davis's, however, the performances are almost all overly broad, sometimes <b>excruciatingly</b> so, characterized by loud laughs, bugging eyes and pumping limbs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Institute on Medicine as a Profession and the {{non-profit}} organization Open Society Foundations reviewed public records into the medical professions alleging {{complicity in the}} abuse of prisoners suspected of terrorism who were held in U.S. custody during the years after 9/11."

Medical professionals were sometimes used at black sites to monitor detainee health. Whether or not the physicians were compelled is an open question.|$|E
2500|$|Each of the {{different}} means of crossing the border had its own complications. Only aircraft of the three Western Allies were allowed to fly to or from West Berlin; civilian traffic was principally served by Air France, British European Airways (later British Airways) and Pan Am. River traffic was hugely important {{to the survival of}} West Berlin, conveying around five million tons of cargo a year to the city, but was subjected to numerous inspections and petty restrictions by the East German authorities. Rail traffic was <b>excruciatingly</b> slow; locomotives and train crews had to be changed at the border, the East German Transport Police (Trapos) carried out inspections using sniffer dogs to uncover stowaways, passports and visas had to be processed at border stations and the condition of the track was so poor that trains were limited to a maximum speed of [...] Road crossings were fairly straightforward but slow because of the extensive border formalities and inspections. Drivers were required to stay on designated transit routes across East Germany.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1888, Barnett {{returned}} to London. [...] She appeared as Mrs Shelton in Cellier's Doris at the Lyric Theatre, which was succeeded {{at the same}} theatre by The Red Hussar by Henry Pottinger Stephens and Edward Solomon. [...] Barnett was announced beforehand as a cast member for the new piece, {{but she did not}} appear. [...] The following year, she toured the British provinces as Martha in Auguste van Biene's production of the Gaiety burlesque Faust up to Date, in which The Era found her [...] "inimitable". [...] This tour lasted for more than a year, taking in all four countries of the United Kingdom. The company followed this with a production of Carmen up to Data, in which Barnett played Micaela. She finally {{returned to}} London in 1894 to create another of Gilbert's formidable older women, Dame Hecla Cortlandt in Gilbert and Osmond Carr's His Excellency.

2500|$|Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone {{dubbed the}} song [...] "saucy". Nicholas Fonseca of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] an [...] "angry-goth anthem". Brendan Butler of Cinema Blend called [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] the [...] "most-friendly radio [...] " [...] {{and noted that}} they could be the {{breakout}} hits from The Open Door {{due to the fact that}} they are the album's only two songs that [...] "don't <b>excruciatingly</b> wane after a minute". The Courier-Mails Jason Nahrung noted that the song was the album's most radio-friendly one and at the same time reminiscent of Lee's previous work with Moody, which according to him meant a use of [...] "heavy bass and drums, spotless and lavish production and Lee's unmistakable vocals". Writing for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield noted how Lee's vocals, which he described as [...] "over the top, in the mode of Eighties shoulder-pad belters like Pat Benatar or Heart's Ann Wilson", are fitting for a breakup song like [...] "Call Me When You're Sober". A writer for Canada.com concluded that Evanescence showed their [...] "staying power" [...] on the [...] "biting single". A Billboard journalist deemed the track's title to be [...] "wonderfully compelling" [...] and went on to describe the song as an [...] "anthemic grinder that musically tills familiar ground".

[...] The purpose of placing divisions in this vicinity was to test the assault of the enemy, and if the enemy were formidable, then the Federal troops would retreat to tighter defense works closer to the city. [...] Not long after the sun arose on what would be an <b>excruciatingly</b> hot day, the confederate forces began their attack. The Confederate forces attacked the 2nd Brigade with considerable force and drove them back, exposing the left flank of the 2nd Iowa. [...] The 2nd Iowa was forced to fall back and set up a new line of defense. [...] The lines changed in this way many times throughout the day. [...] Eventually, the 2nd Iowa would defend an area known as “White House.” [...] Here the 2nd Iowa repelled an enemy attack, using the high ground to their advantage. [...] After about an hour of intense fighting, columns of Confederate reinforcements were seen in the distance. [...] Knowing the arrival of those reinforcements would mean defeat for the regiment in the current location, Colonel Baker ordered a charge which drove the remaining enemy from the open field and allowed the regiment to hold the position a while longer. [...] During this charge Colonel Baker was mortally wounded, leaving the command of the company {{in the hands of the}} capable Noah W. Mills. [...] The 2nd Iowa along with the rest of General Davies’ division held these positions as long as possible, before being ordered by Davies to fall back slowly and begrudgingly.
