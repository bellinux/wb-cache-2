5|$|While a phoneme can be {{represented}} {{by more than one}} <b>grapheme,</b> each <b>grapheme</b> can be pronounced in only one way. This means that the actual pronunciation of a word is always clear from its orthographic form.|$|E
5|$|In another study, synesthetes were {{prompted}} to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and <b>grapheme</b> representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
25|$|Systematic {{transliteration}} is {{a mapping}} from one system of writing into another, typically <b>grapheme</b> to <b>grapheme.</b> Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader {{who knows the}} system can reconstruct the original spelling.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to <b>graphemes,</b> as new meanings become assigned to those <b>graphemes.</b> In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic <b>graphemes</b> inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin <b>graphemes</b> as soon as the Glagolitic <b>graphemes</b> acquired the new meaning.|$|R
3000|$|The UG {{decision}} tree extrapolates <b>graphemes</b> to phonetic classifications using generic mappings of Table  2. <b>Graphemes</b> with simple pronunciations are classified {{according to their}} phonetic realization. For example, ‘s’ and ‘z’ (ز س) are grouped together because the pronunciations of these <b>Graphemes</b> are fricative, central, coronal, anterior, continuant, and strident. Complex pronunciations (i.e., multiple or sequence pronunciation) of the <b>graphemes</b> ‘F’, ‘N’, ‘K’, A’, ‘|’, ‘p’, ‘l’, ‘w’, ‘y’ ([...] [...]...|$|R

It is also noticed that the metamorphosis of <b>graphemes</b> (This might be designated as [...] "Archewriting") as a living object/subject in Ray's positive manipulation of Bengali <b>graphemes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unicode codifies over {{a hundred}} {{thousand}} characters. Most of those represent <b>graphemes</b> for processing as linear text. Some, however, either do not represent <b>graphemes,</b> or, as <b>graphemes,</b> require exceptional treatment. Unlike the ASCII control characters and other characters included for legacy round-trip capabilities, these other special-purpose characters endow plain text with important semantics.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the velar <b>graphemes</b> in Hittite, commonly transliterated as KA, GA and QA. It is normally assumed that these <b>graphemes</b> {{can be used}} interchangeably. However, {{it is argued that}} this is clearly not the case. The thesis then tries to show in which environments the different <b>graphemes</b> are used and how the use can be motivated phonologically...|$|R
500|$|The śuddha <b>graphemes</b> are the {{mainstay}} of the Sinhalese alphabet and are used on an everyday-basis. Every sequence of sounds of the Sinhalese language of today can be represented by these <b>graphemes.</b> Additionally, the śuddha set comprises <b>graphemes</b> for retroflex [...] and , which are no longer phonemic in modern Sinhala. These two letters were needed for the representation of Eḷu, but are now obsolete from a purely phonemic view. However, words which historically contain these two phonemes are still often written with the <b>graphemes</b> representing the retroflex sounds.|$|R

25|$|Dedicated {{regions of}} the brain are {{specialized}} for given functions. Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions {{may account for the}} many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure). This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the color of a <b>grapheme</b> in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the <b>grapheme.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{disagreement}} as {{to whether}} capital and lower-case letters are allographs or distinct <b>graphemes.</b> Capitals are generally found in certain triggering contexts which do not change the word: When used as a proper name, for example, or {{at the beginning of}} a sentence, or all caps in a newspaper headline. Some linguists consider digraphs like the [...] in ship to be distinct <b>graphemes,</b> but these are generally analyzed as sequences of <b>graphemes.</b> Ligatures, however, such as , are distinct <b>graphemes,</b> as are various letters with distinctive diacritics, such as [...]|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that <b>graphemes</b> are a crucial level of orthographic {{representation}} above letters. Current connectionist models of reading, however, {{do not address}} how the mapping from letters to <b>graphemes</b> is learned. One major challenge for computational modeling is therefore developing a model that learns this mapping and can assign the <b>graphemes</b> to linguistically meaningful categories such as the onset, vowel, and coda of a syllable. Here, we present a model that learns {{to do this in}} English for strings of any letter length and any number of syllables. The model is evaluated on error rates and further validated on the results of a behavioral experiment designed to examine ambiguities in the processing of <b>graphemes.</b> The results show that the model (a) chooses <b>graphemes</b> from letter strings {{with a high level of}} accuracy, even when trained on only a small portion of the English lexicon; (b) chooses a similar set of <b>graphemes</b> as people do in situations where different <b>graphemes</b> can potentially be selected; (c) predicts orthographic effects on segmentation which are found in human data; and (d) can be readily integrated into a full-blown model of multi-syllabic reading aloud such as CDP++ (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2010). Altogether, these results suggest that the model provides a plausible hypothesis for the kind of computations that underlie the use of <b>graphemes</b> in skilled reading...|$|R
40|$|Anime, Japanese {{animation}}, is massive, with “ 60 % of {{the animation}} {{in the world}} made in Japan” (Goto-Jones 2009, 3). Anime occasionally makes an innovative use of <b>graphemes</b> on screen, but {{this has not been}} studied so far. This study, then, describes and analyses how <b>graphemes</b> have been translated in anime, presenting a series of cases, but concentrating on three particular releases: Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, and Tōkyō Godfathers, products that feature a frequent and innovative use of <b>graphemes</b> in its anime. These <b>graphemes</b> are categorised into two types: (1) the ones {{that are part of the}} original anime and (2) the <b>graphemes</b> added in fansubbed anime. Much anime is fansubbed (subtitled by fans), and these fans are not constrained by the industry’s rules, meaning that they have complete liberty in subtitling, allowing for really creative forms of subtitling. Even if this freedom can sometimes be taken to the extreme—with subtitles covering the entire screen—fansubs have shown creative subtitling solutions, specially in the case of <b>graphemes</b> that cover a great part of the screen. After describing and analysing these <b>graphemes</b> and how they have been subtitled, this article concludes that, even if fansubs can frequently be excessive, they are at the fore of creativity, and present better solutions than official subtitles in the translation of <b>graphemes</b> in anime...|$|R
25|$|So {{rather than}} treat {{the issue as}} a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of <b>grapheme,</b> but {{also in terms of}} underlying meaning {{as in the case of}} a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a <b>grapheme</b> variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such <b>grapheme</b> variations.|$|E
25|$|Standard Lakota Orthography, as used by {{majority}} of schools, is in principle phonemic, {{which means that}} each character (<b>grapheme)</b> represents only one distinctive sound (phoneme), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration which is treated phonetically.|$|E
25|$|The terms glyph, {{sign and}} {{character}} are sometimes {{used to refer}} to a <b>grapheme.</b> Common usage varies from discipline to discipline; compare cuneiform sign, Maya glyph, Chinese character. The glyphs of most writing systems are made up of lines (or strokes) and are therefore called linear, but there are glyphs in non-linear writing systems made up of other types of marks, such as Cuneiform and Braille.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a technique for learning pronunciation rules {{based on the}} Version Space algorithm. In particular, we describe how to learn pronunciation rules for a representative subset of the English <b>graphemes.</b> We present a learning procedure called LEP-G. 1 (learning to pronounce English <b>graphemes)</b> that learns English pronunciation rules from examples {{in the form of}} word-pronunciation pairs. With our approach, we can translate not only English words in dictionaries, but also new words such as tuple, pixel, and deque which are not found in dictionaries. An experiment where LEP-G. 1 learned pronunciation rules for 12 <b>graphemes</b> strongly suggests that learning the other possible 52 <b>graphemes</b> in English is feasible...|$|R
25|$|Carol Steen {{experiences}} multiple {{forms of}} synesthesia, including <b>grapheme</b> → color synesthesia, music → color synesthesia, and touch → color synesthesia. She most often uses her music → color synesthesia and touch → color synesthesia in creating her works of art, which often involves attempting to capture, select, and transmit her synesthetic experiences into her paintings. Steen describes how her synesthetic experience during an acupuncture session {{led to the}} creation of the painting Vision.|$|E
25|$|In Spanish, the <b>grapheme</b> ñ is {{considered}} a new letter different from n and collated between n and o, as it denotes a different sound {{from that of a}} plain n. But the accented vowels á, é, í, ó, ú are not separated from the unaccented vowels a, e, i, o, u, as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.|$|E
25|$|Œ (minuscule: œ) is a Latin {{alphabet}} <b>grapheme,</b> a ligature of o and e. In mediæval {{and early}} modern Latin, {{it was used}} to represent the Greek diphthong οι and in a few non-Greek words, usages that continue in English and French. In French, it is also used in some non-learned words, representing then mid-front rounded vowel-sounds, rather than sounding the same as é or è, those being its traditional French values in the words borrowed from / via Latin.|$|E
2500|$|The Bengali {{script is}} a cursive script with eleven <b>graphemes</b> or signs {{denoting}} nine vowels and two diphthongs, and thirty-nine <b>graphemes</b> representing consonants and other modifiers. There are no distinct {{upper and lower}} case letter forms. The letters run {{from left to right}} and spaces are used to separate orthographic words. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the <b>graphemes</b> that links them together called [...] matra.|$|R
40|$|In colour-grapheme synaesthesia, non-coloured <b>graphemes</b> are {{perceived}} as being inherently coloured. In recent years, it has become evident that synaesthesia-inducing <b>graphemes</b> can affect visual processing in a manner comparable to real, physical colours. Here, we exploit the phenomenon of binocular rivalry in which incompatible images presented dichoptically compete for conscious expression. Importantly, the competition only arises if the two images are sufficiently different; if {{the difference between the}} images is small, the images will fuse into a single mixed percept. We show that achromatic <b>graphemes</b> that induce synaesthetic colour percepts evoke binocular rivalry, while without the synaesthetic percept, they do not. That is, compared to achromatically perceived <b>graphemes,</b> synaesthesia-inducing <b>graphemes</b> increase the predominance of binocular rivalry over binocular fusion. This finding shows that the synaesthetic colour experience can provide the conditions for evoking binocular rivalry, much like stimulus features that induce rivalry in normal vision...|$|R
50|$|Long vowels and consonants are {{represented}} by double occurrences of the relevant <b>graphemes.</b> This causes no confusion, and permits these sounds to be written without having to nearly double {{the size of the}} alphabet to accommodate separate <b>graphemes</b> for long sounds.|$|R
25|$|That {{leaves us}} with {{settling}} on one unified reference <b>grapheme</b> for all z-variants, which is contentious since few outside of Japan would recognize 佛 and 仏 as equivalent. Even within Japan, the variants are on different sides of a major simplification called Shinjitai. Unicode would effectively make the PRC's simplification of 侣 (U+4FA3) and 侶 (U+4FB6) a monumental difference by comparison. Such a plan would also eliminate the very visually distinct variations for characters like 直 (U+76F4) and 雇 (U+96C7).|$|E
25|$|Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian Latin {{alphabet}} {{have the}} symbols č, ć, đ, š and ž, which are considered separate letters and {{are listed as}} such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. They also have one digraph including a diacritic, dž, which is also alphabetized independently, and follows d and precedes đ in the alphabetical order. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a <b>grapheme</b> (glyph) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs dž, lj and nj).|$|E
25|$|Each kana {{character}} (syllabogram) {{corresponds to}} one {{sound in the}} Japanese language. This is always CV (consonant onset with vowel nucleus), such as ka, ki, etc., or V (vowel), such as a, i, etc., with the sole exception of the C <b>grapheme</b> for nasal codas usually romanised as n. This structure had some scholars label the system moraic instead of syllabic, because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda (i.e. CVn, CVm, CVng), a CVV syllable with complex nucleus (i.e. multiple or expressively long vowels), or a CCV syllable with complex onset (i.e. including a glide, CyV, CwV).|$|E
