25|$|A faster, fully <b>hardware-based</b> {{multiplier}} makes instructions such as MUL and IMUL {{several times}} as fast (and more predictable) than in the 80486; the execution time is reduced from 13~42 clock cycles down to 10~11 for 32-bit operands.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another option}} is to use a compose key (<b>hardware-based</b> or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, and then n results in ñ. A capital N can be {{substituted}} to produce Ñ, and in most cases the order of ~ and n can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|The System z9 adds 128-Bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to {{the list}} of <b>hardware-based</b> {{cryptographic}} algorithms. Other hardware-boosted features include additional random number generation and SHA algorithms. This specialized encryption hardware means System z9 potentially outperforms other platforms which must rely on encryption software.|$|E
25|$|Some {{manufacturers}} have produced USB flash drives which use <b>hardware-based</b> encryption {{as part of}} the design, removing the need for third-party encryption software. In limited circumstances these drives have been shown to have security problems, and are typically more expensive than software-based systems, which are available for free.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} {{software-based}} virtual studio environments have emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical <b>hardware-based</b> production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, {{it is now possible}} to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances have democratized music creation, leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet.|$|E
25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more <b>hardware-based)</b> multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (pin grid array) packages.|$|E
25|$|With wide deployment(s) of flash drives {{being used}} in various environments (secured or otherwise), the issue of data and {{information}} security remains important. The use of biometrics and encryption is becoming the norm {{with the need for}} increased security for data; on-the-fly encryption systems are particularly useful in this regard, as they can transparently encrypt large amounts of data. In some cases a secure USB drive may use a <b>hardware-based</b> encryption mechanism that uses a hardware module instead of software for strongly encrypting data. IEEE 1667 is an attempt to create a generic authentication platform for USB drives. It is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Vista (Service Pack 2 with a hotfix).|$|E
25|$|By the mid 2000s {{a number}} of {{software-based}} virtual studio environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical <b>hardware-based</b> production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using {{little more than a}} single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to greatly expanding the potential {{size of its}} games, this add-on unit upgraded the graphics and sound capabilities by adding a second, more powerful processor, more system memory, and <b>hardware-based</b> scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games. [...] It provided battery-backed storage RAM to allow games to save high scores, configuration data, and game progress; an additional data storage cartridge was sold separately.|$|E
500|$|Treasure {{began to}} develop Mischief Makers in mid 1995. At the time, they knew little about the Nintendo 64's final {{technical}} specifications, graphics implementation, and development kit, but were nevertheless interested in the console and its improved [...] "pixel quality". Historically, Treasure developed games exclusively for Sega consoles, which made Mischief Makers their first release for a Nintendo console. Bringing Mischief Makers to the Nintendo 64 was a <b>hardware-based</b> decision: the Nintendo 64's cartridges were more expensive than CD-ROMs, but they loaded data instantly and were thus more conducive for action games such as Mischief Makers. However, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa said that development for the Nintendo 64 had a harsher learning curve than even the Sega Saturn. Other than the special attention required to build a single boss in 3D, the team did not use features specific to the Nintendo 64 hardware.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern systems divide memory into {{pages that}} are [...] in size, {{often with the}} {{capability}} to use huge pages from [...] to [...] in size. [...] Page translations are cached in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). [...] Some systems, mainly older RISC designs, trap into the OS when a page translation is {{not found in the}} TLB. [...] Most systems use a <b>hardware-based</b> tree walker. [...] Most systems allow the MMU to be disabled, but some disable the MMU when trapping into OS code.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2014, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks {{proposed}} that the company construct an Android device. Company officials, including Chen, showed concerns over the project, as they believed the platform was not secure enough. However, Louks gained support for the project after outlining plans for <b>hardware-based</b> security. At Mobile World Congress 2015, BlackBerry's device head Ron Louks briefly presented a non-functioning prototype of a new, BlackBerry 10 phone that featured a sliding keyboard and a screen curved across both sides, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge that was unveiled during the same convention. In July 2015, new images of the curved device leaked under the codename [...] "Venice"; unlike the version presented at MWC, it was now shown to be running Android 5.0 [...] "Lollipop" [...] rather than BlackBerry 10. Information about the device's software leaked in August 2015, showing a [...] "stock" [...] Android experience augmented with ports of features and apps from BB10, such as BlackBerry Hub.|$|E
50|$|UPnP media servers are {{available}} for most operating systems and many hardware platforms. UPnP AV media servers can either be categorized as software-based or <b>hardware-based.</b> Software-based UPnP AV media servers can be run on a PC. <b>Hardware-based</b> UPnP AV media servers may run on any NAS devices or any specific hardware for delivering media, such as a DVR. As of May 2008, there were more software-based UPnP AV media servers than there were <b>hardware-based</b> servers.|$|E
50|$|There are {{multiple}} tools {{available in the}} market that allow for disk encryption. However, they vary greatly in features and security. They are divided into three main categories: software-based, <b>hardware-based</b> within the storage device, and <b>hardware-based</b> elsewhere (such as CPU or host bus adaptor). <b>Hardware-based</b> full disk encryption within the storage device are called self-encrypting drives and have no impact on performance whatsoever. Furthermore, the media-encryption key never leaves the device itself and is therefore not available to any virus in the operating system.|$|E
