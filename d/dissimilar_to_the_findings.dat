40|$|In {{short-term}} serial recall, similar-sounding {{items are}} remembered less well than items {{that do not}} sound alike. This phonological similarity effect has been observed with lists composed only of similar items, and also with lists that mix together similar and dissimilar items. An additional consistent finding with mixed lists has been an effect we refer to as "dissimilar immunity". <b>Dissimilar</b> immunity refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that ordered recall of dissimilar items is the same whether these items occur in pure lists of dissimilar items or mixed lists. We present three experiments that contradict these previous findings by showing that phonological similarity enhances memory for order of dissimilar items on the same list. Previous studies failed to detect this effect {{because they did not}} appropriately examine or control the distribution of different error types. The memory benefit for dissimilar items cannot be accommodated by several current models but is compatible with a dynamic network theory of memory and a distinctiveness account of serial recall. 3 Dissimilar Items Benefit From Phonological Similarity in Serial Recall: The standard phonological similarity effect in serial recall refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well-replicated <b>finding</b> that lists composed of similar-sounding items are less accurately recalled than lists in which items do not sound alike (e. g., Baddeley, 1966, 1968; Conrad, 1964; Henson, Norris, Page, & Baddeley, 1996; Wickelgren, 1965 a, b). This effect is of considerable generality, occuring with lists of letters (Baddeley, 1968) as well as with word lists (Baddeley, 1966; Coltheart, 1993; Henry, 1991), and it has had unparalleled theoretical impact, being {{considered one of the most}} crucial features of short-term serial recall (Farrell, 2001).
