40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{multiple}} annotation problem in medical application of cancer detection in digital images. The main assumption is that though images are labeled by many experts, {{the number of images}} read by the same expert is not large. Thus differing with the existing work on modeling each expert and ground truth simultaneously, the multi annotation information is used in a soft manner. The multiple labels from different experts are used to estimate the probability of the findings to be marked as malignant. The learning algorithm minimizes the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the modeled probabilities and desired ones constraining the model to be compact. The probabilities are modeled by logit regression and multiple instance learning concept is used by us. Experiments on a real-life computer aided diagnosis (CAD) problem for CXR <b>CAD</b> <b>lung</b> cancer detection demonstrate that the proposed algorithm leads to similar results as learning with a binary RVMMIL classifier or a mixture of binary RVMMIL models per annotator. However, this model achieves a smaller complexity and is more preferable in practice. Comment: 20 pages, repor...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{segmentation}} in thoracic {{computed tomography}} (CT) scans is an important preprocessing step for computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> of <b>lung</b> diseases. This paper focuses on the segmentation of the lung field in thoracic CT images. Traditional lung segmentation is based on Gray level thresholding techniques, which often requires setting a threshold and is sensitive to image contrasts. In this paper, we present a fully automated method for robust and accurate lung segmentation, which includes a enhanced thresholding algorithm and a refinement scheme based on a texture-aware active contour model. In our thresholding algorithm, a histogram based image stretch technique is performed in advance to uniformly increase contrasts between areas with low Hounsfield unit (HU) values and areas with high HU in all CT images. This stretch step enables the following threshold-free segmentation, which is the Otsu algorithm with contour analysis. However, as a threshold based segmentation, it has common issues such as holes, noises and inaccurate segmentation boundaries that will cause problems in future <b>CAD</b> for <b>lung</b> disease detection. To solve these problems, a refinement technique is proposed that captures vessel structures and lung boundaries and then smooths variations via texture-aware active contour model. Experiments on 2, 342 diagnosis CT images demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method. Performance comparison with existing methods shows the advantages of our method...|$|R
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes that can increase the risk of hospitalization and death in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is comorbidity. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the proportion of comorbidity among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a teaching hospital, West Java, Indonesia, from January to December 2012. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted from September to November 2013 in Internal Medicine Department of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung. The study used 107 medical records that consisted of data about patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were hospitalized between January to December 2012. The medical records were collected using simple random sampling. Variables identified in this study were characteristics of the patients (age, sex, and smoking history) and comorbidity events. Comorbidity events were coronary artery disease (<b>CAD),</b> <b>lung</b> cancer, diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, anemia, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, depression, pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), and hypertension. Age variable was divided into 3 categories with interval 20 years. All collected data were presented in frequency distribution. Results: Most of the patients in this study were 50 – 69 years old, male, and had smoking history. The highest proportion of comorbid condition was hypertension, followed by anemia and coronary artery disease. Conclusions: Patients with COPD have one or more other diseases (comorbidity).

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method of {{classifying}} the local structure types, such as nodules, vessels, and junctions, in thoracic CT scans. This classification {{is important in}} the context of computer aided detection (<b>CAD)</b> of <b>lung</b> nodules. The proposed method {{can be used as a}} post-process component of any <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> system. In such a scenario, the classification results provide an effective means of removing false positives caused by vessels and junctions thus improving overall performance. As main advantage, the proposed solution transforms the complex problem of classifying various 3 D topological structures into much simpler 2 D data clustering problem, to which more generic and flexible solutions are available in literature, and which is better suited for visualization. Given a nodule candidate, first, our solution robustly fits an anisotropic Gaussian to the data. The resulting Gaussian center and spread parameters are used to affine-normalize the data domain so as to warp the fitted anisotropic ellipsoid into a fixed-size isotropic sphere. We propose an automatic method to extract a 3 D spherical manifold, containing the appropriate bounding surface of the target structure. Scale selection is performed by a data driven entropy minimization approach. The manifold is analyzed for high intensity clusters, corresponding to protruding structures. Techniques involve EM clustering with automatic mode number estimation, directional statistics, and hierarchical clustering with a modified Bhattacharyya distance. The estimated number of high intensity clusters explicitly determines the type of pulmonary structures: nodule (0), attached nodule (1), vessel (2), junction (> 3). We show accurate classification results for selected examples in thoracic CT scans. This local procedure is more flexible and efficient than current state of the art and will help to improve the accuracy of general <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{key problem}} of {{computer-aided}} diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> of <b>lung</b> cancer is to segment pathologically changed tissues fast and accurately.

The enhanced spatial function considers contributions to fuzzy membership from both the grayscale similarity between central pixels and single neighboring pixels and the spatial similarity between central pixels and neighborhood and improves effectively the convergence rate and self-adaptivity of the algorithm.

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} the overall performance {{of an existing}} CAD algorithm with thin-section computed tomography (CT) in the detection of pulmonary nodules and to evaluate detection sensitivity at a varying range of nodule density, size, and location. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted on 20 patients with 322 suspected nodules who underwent diagnostic chest imaging using 64 -row multi-detector CT. The examinations were evaluated on reconstructed images of 1. 4 mm thickness and 0. 7 mm interval. Detection of pulmonary nodules, initially by a radiologist of 2 years experience (RAD) and later by <b>CAD</b> <b>lung</b> nodule software was assessed. Then, CAD nodule candidates were accepted or rejected accordingly. Detected nodules were classified based on their size, density, and location. The performance of the RAD and CAD system was compared with the gold standard that is true nodules confirmed by consensus of senior RAD and CAD together. The overall sensitivity and false-positive (FP) rate of CAD software was calculated. Observations and Results: Of the 322 suspected nodules, 221 were classified as true nodules on the consensus of senior RAD and CAD together. Of the true nodules, the RAD detected 206 (93. 2 %) and 202 (91. 4 %) by the CAD. CAD and RAD together picked up more number of nodules than either CAD or RAD alone. Overall sensitivity for nodule detection with the CAD program was 91. 4 %, and FP detection per patient was 5. 5 %. The CAD showed comparatively higher sensitivity for nodules of size 4 - 10 mm (93. 4 %) and nodules in hilar (100 %) and central (96. 5 %) location when compared to RAD′s performance. Conclusion: CAD performance was high in detecting pulmonary nodules including the small size and low-density nodules. CAD even with relatively high FP rate, assists and improves RAD′s performance as a second reader, especially for nodules located in the central and hilar region and for small nodules by saving RADs time...|$|R

The currently implemented system was developed using the National Cancer Institute caGrid infrastructure {{and is designed}} to support the identification of lung nodules on thoracic computed tomography. However, the infrastructure is general and can support any type of distributed review. caGrid data and analytical services are used to link DICOM image databases and CAD systems and to interact with human readers.

40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{detection}} {{systems in}} medical sciences improve {{the accuracy of}} the diagnosis and reduce the time of analysis. This field in lung disease referred to computer aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> system. <b>Lung</b> nodule detection is the most important task of these systems. CAD systems used the combination of image processing techniques in order to detect the lung nodules. Lung CT image clustering {{is one of the most}} important steps in CAT systems. The accurate clustering method reduces the complex following steps and reduces the rate of fault. In this paper we propose an improved MKM clustering method which resolves the weakness of the previous methods and provides an accurate segmentation. In conventional concept of moving, the members in cluster with highest fitness are forced to move to the cluster with the lowest fitness. In the enhanced version of the Moving K-Means algorithm the members move in a defined range. We use particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the range of the moving radius. Our proposed optimization algorithm with PSO clusters the CT images into the homogenous segment and resolves the problem of the dead center and the trapped center. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The resultant of moving radius range shows that the proposed algorithm fulfilled the relationship condition with optimum value of R= 1. 899...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} a lung area {{extraction}} technique from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images for computer-aided diagnosis (<b>CAD)</b> systems. In <b>lung</b> cancer cases, pulmonary nodules are typical pathological changes and thus {{they are the}} target to be detected by CAD systems. The isolated nodules can be detected more easily by CAD systems developed previously, while previous CAD systems are often hard to detect non-isolated nodules. The extraction technique can then be used for transforming the non-isolated pulmonary nodules connected to {{the walls of the}} chest into isolated ones. The technique proposed here is based on an active contour model, but such model is often trapped into a local optimum solution. To avoid the local optimum solutions, an essential core of the proposed technique is to select an appropriate initial contour by using an anatomical feature of the lung shape in X-ray CT slices. Some experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for assisting the CAD systems to detect non-isolated nodules more accurately...|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} part of the MAGIC- 5 (Medical Applications on a Grid Infrastructure Connection) {{experiment}} of the Italian INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). A simple CAD (Computer-Assisted Detection) {{system for}} juxta-pleural lung nodules in CT images is presented, with the purpose of comparing different 2 D concavity-patching techniques and assessing the respective efficiency in locating nodules. After a short introduction on the motivation, and a review of some <b>CAD</b> systems for <b>lung</b> nodules already published by the MAGIC- 5 Collaboration, the paper describes the main lines of this particular approach, giving preliminary results and comments. In our procedure, candidate nodules are identified by patching lung border concavities in a hierarchical multiscale framework. Once located, they are fed to an artificial neural network for false positive reduction. The system has a modular structure that easily allows the insertion of arbitrary border-smoothing functions for concavity detection and nodule searching. In this paper the a-hull and morphological closing are compared, proving the higher sensitivity of the former, which also appears computationally less heavy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world-wide. The {{prognosis}} is poor, with less than 15 % of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis. The poor prognosis is attributable to lack of efficient diagnostic methods for early detection and lack of successful treatment metastatic disease. However, persons with early lung cancer have lower lung cancer-related mortality than those with extensive disease, suggesting early detection and treatment of lung cancer might be beneficial. Computer Tomography is a clinical recommended imaging tool for the detection, diagnosis and follows up of many cancers. The most essential and challenging task for physicians is detection of lesions. Detection of lesions is found to be most difficult because of low contrast of an image or sometimes their residual. This paper is aimed to design computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system which has four different phases for detection of cancerous nodules from lung CT (Computer Tomography) images and they are preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Ant colony optimization as feature selection technique is being used to get more accurate result. Two kinds of machine learning techniques, viz., SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) have been presented which classify the abnormal or normal lung image. ANN has proved that it gives the best accuracy as compared to SVM. The system accuracy using SVM is 93. 2 % and ANN is 98. 40 %. In this study, our methods are validated via a series of experimentation conducted with a data set of 250 lung CT images and the procedure is implemented using MATLAB tool.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the added value of computer-aided detection (<b>CAD)</b> for <b>lung</b> nodules on chest radiographs when radiologists have bone-suppressed images (BSIs) available. Written {{informed consent was}} waived by the institutional review board. Selection of study images and study setup was reviewed {{and approved by the}} institutional review boards. Three hundred posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs (189 radiographs with negative findings and 111 radiographs with a solitary nodule) in 300 subjects were selected from image archives at four institutions. PA images were processed by using a commercially available CAD, and PA BSIs were generated. Five radiologists and three residents evaluated the radiographs with BSIs available, first, without CAD and, second, after inspection of the CAD marks. Readers marked locations suspicious for a nodule and provided a confidence score for that location to be a nodule. Location-based receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Area under the curve (AUC) functioned as figure of merit, and P values were computed with the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz method. Average nodule size was 16. 2 mm. Stand-alone CAD reached a sensitivity of 74 % at 1. 0 false-positive mark per image. Without CAD, average AUC for observers was 0. 812. With CAD, performance significantly improved to an AUC of 0. 841 (P =. 0001). CAD detected 127 of 239 nodules that were missed after evaluation of the radiographs together with BSIs pooled over all observers. Only 57 of these detections were eventually marked by the observers after review of CAD candidates. CAD improved radiologists' performance for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs, even when baseline performance was optimized by providing lateral radiographs and BSIs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a commercially available computer-aided detection (CAD) system for detection of lung nodule on posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph in a varied patient population who are referred to computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) of the chest as a reference standard. Patients who had a PA chest radiograph with concomitant CTA of the chest were included in this retrospective study. The PA chest radiograph was analyzed by a CAD device, and results were recorded. A qualitative assessment of the CAD results was performed using a 5 -point Likert scale. The CTA was then reviewed to determine if there were correlative nodules. The presence of a correlative nodule between 0. 5  cm and 1. 5  cm was considered a positive result. The baseline sensitivity of the system was determined to be 0. 707 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 52 – 0. 86), with a specificity of 0. 50 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 38 – 0. 76). Positive predictive value was 0. 30 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 24 – 0. 49), with a negative predictive value of 0. 858 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 82 – 0. 95), and accuracy of 0. 555 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 40 – 0. 66). When excluding nodules that were qualitatively determined by a thoracic radiologist to be false positives, the specificity was 0. 781 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 764 – 0. 839), the positive predictive value was 0. 564 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 491 – 0. 654), the negative predictive value was 0. 829 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 819 – 0. 878), and the accuracy was 0. 737 (95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 721 – 0. 801).

The potential benefits of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) are evident and have been approved. Still, CBIR is not a well-established part of daily routine of radiologists. We have already presented a concept of CBIR integration for the radiology workflow {{in accordance with the}} Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) framework. The retrieval result is composed as a Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Reporting (SR) document.

40|$|The {{automatic}} detection of lung nodules attached to other pulmonary structures {{is a useful}} yet challenging task in <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> systems. In this paper, we propose a stratified statistical learning approach to recognize whether a candidate nodule detected in CT images connects to any of three other major lung anatomies, namely vessel, fissure and lung wall, or is solitary with background parenchyma. First, we develop a fully automated voxel-by-voxel labeling/segmentation method of nodule, vessel, fissure, lung wall and parenchyma given a 3 D lung image, via a unified feature set and classifier under conditional random field. Second, the generated Class Probability Response Maps (PRM) by voxel-level classifiers, are used to form the so-called pairwise Probability Co-occurrence Maps (PCM) which encode the spatial contextual correlations of the candidate nodule, {{in relation to other}} anatomical landmarks. Based on PCMs, higher level classifiers are trained to recognize whether the nodule touches other pulmonary structures, as a multi-label problem. We also present a new iterative fissure structure enhancement filter with superior performance. For experimental validation, we create an annotated database of 784 subvolumes with nodules of various sizes, shapes, densities and contextual anatomies, and from 239 patients. High accuracy of multi-class voxel labeling is achieved 89. 3 % ∼ 91. 2 %. The Area under ROC Curve (AUC) of vessel, fissure and lung wall connectivity classificatio...|$|R
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{image analysis}} technology suffers from imperfection, imprecision and vagueness of the input data and its propagation to all individual {{components of the}} technology including image enhancement, segmentation and object classification. Furthermore, a computerized medical image analysis system (CMIAS) deals with another source of ambiguity that {{is inherent in the}} image-based practice of medicine and intuitive knowledge of experts [...] Therefore, a CMIAS such as computer aided detection (CAD) technologies implicitly suffer from uncertainty and vagueness both from image analysis techniques and medical diagnosis. Although several technology-oriented studies have been reported for CAD, no attempt has been made to address, model and overcome these types of uncertainty {{in the design of the}} CAD. However, uncertainty issues directly affect the accuracy of the system. This study addresses the main sources of the uncertainty in a CAD system. While uncertainty outcomes are latent in the input of a classifier, the aim is to model them in the classification for a CAD application. For this, this research takes advantages of type- 2 fuzzy logic (T 2 FL). Integrating a T 2 FL model for object classification in CAD architecture allows us to model uncertainty issues. For this, an automatic approach models uncertainty in training dataset using membership function of a type- 2 fuzzy set. This approach was applied to the candidate nodule classification problem in a <b>lung</b> <b>CAD</b> application. The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis of the classifier results (with an average accuracy 95...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>CAD</b> systems {{require the}} ability to {{classify}} a variety of pulmonary structures {{as part of the}} diagnostic process. The purpose of this work was to develop a methodology for fully automated voxel-by-voxel classification of airways, fissures, nodules, and vessels from chest CT images using a single feature set and classification method. Twenty-nine thin section CT scans were obtained from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). Multiple radiologists labeled voxels corresponding to the following structures: airways (trachea to 6 th generation), major and minor lobar fissures, nodules, and vessels (hilum to peripheral), and normal lung parenchyma. The labeled data was used in conjunction with a supervised machine learning approach (AdaBoost) to train a set of ensemble classifiers. Each ensemble classifier was trained to detect voxels part of a specific structure (either airway, fissure, nodule, vessel, or parenchyma). The feature set consisted of voxel attenuation and a small number of features based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix (used to differentiate structures by shape). When each ensemble classifier was composed of 20 weak classifiers, the AUC values for the airway, fissure, nodule, vessel, and parenchyma classifiers were 0. 984 ± 0. 011, 0. 949 ± 0. 009, 0. 945 ± 0. 018, 0. 953 ± 0. 016, and 0. 931 ± 0. 015 respectively. The strong results suggest that this could be an effective input to higher-level anatomical based segmentation models with the potential to improve CAD performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lung {{diseases}} and lung cancer {{are among the}} most dangerous diseases with high mortality in both men and women. Lung nodules are abnormal pulmonary masses and are among major lung symptoms. A Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system may {{play an important role in}} accurate and early detection of lung nodules. This article presents a new <b>CAD</b> system for <b>lung</b> nodule detection from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Methods: Twenty-five adult patients with lung nodules in their CT scan images presented to the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2011 - 2012 were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomly assigned into two experimental (9 female, 6 male, mean age 43 ± 5. 63 yrs) and control (6 female, 4 male, mean age 39 ± 4. 91 yrs) groups. A fully-automatic method was developed for detecting lung nodules by employing medical image processing and analysis and statistical pattern recognition algorithms. esults: Using segmentation methods, the lung parenchyma was extracted from 2 -D CT images. Then, candidate regions were labeled in pseudo-color images. In the next step, some features of lung nodules were extracted. Finally, an artificial feed forward neural network was used for classification of nodules. Conclusion: Considering the complexity and different shapes of lung nodules and large number of CT images to evaluate, finding lung nodules are difficult and time consuming for physicians and include human error. Experimental results showed the accuracy of the proposed method to be appropriate (P< 0. 05) for lung nodule detection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRationale and Objectives To {{assess the}} effect of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) lossy image compression of multidetector computed tomography chest scans on computer-aided detection (<b>CAD)</b> of solid <b>lung</b> nodules greater than 4 mm in size. Materials and Methods A total of 120 cases, acquired with 1. 25 -mm collimation, were collected from 5 different sites, of which 66 / 120 were low-dose cases. Two chest radiologists established that 37 cases had no actionable lung nodules; the remaining 83 cases contained 169 nodules (range 3. 8 – 35. 0 mm, mean 5. 8 mm ± 3. 0 [SD]). All cases were compressed using the 3 D Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees algorithm to 24 : 1, 48 : 1, and 96 : 1 levels. A study of {{the effect of}} compression on computer-aided detection (CAD) sensitivity was performed at operating points of 2. 5 false marks (FM), 5 FM, and 10 FM per case using McNemar's test. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact on CAD sensitivity by compression level on nodule and image characteristics. Results Compared with no compression, there was no significant degradation in CAD sensitivity found at any of the studied compression levels and operating points. However, between compression levels, there was marginal association with sensitivity. Specifically, 24 : 1 level was significantly better than 96 : 1 at all operating points, and occasionally better than no compression at 10 FM/case. Based on multivariate analysis, nodule location was found to be a significant predictor (P =. 01) with a lower sensitivity associated with juxtapleural nodules. Nodule size, dose, reconstruction filter, and contrast medium were not significant predictors. Conclusion CAD detection performance of solid lung nodules did not suffer until 48 : 1 compression...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess how}} {{computer-aided}} detection (CAD) affects reader performance in detecting early lung cancer on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods: In this ethics committee-approved study, 46 individuals with 49 computed tomographically (CT) -detected and histologically proved lung cancers and 65 patients without nodules at CT were retrospectively included. All subjects {{participated in a}} lung cancer screening trial. Chest radiographs were obtained within 2 months after screening CT. Four radiology residents and two experienced radiologists {{were asked to identify}} and localize potential cancers on the chest radiographs, first without and subsequently with the use of CAD software. A figure of merit was calculated by using free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Tumor diameter ranged from 5. 1 to 50. 7 mm (median, 11. 8 mm). Fifty-one percent (22 of 49) of lesions were subtle and detected by two or fewer readers. Stand-alone CAD sensitivity was 61 %, with an average of 2. 4 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph. Average sensitivity was 63 % for radiologists at 0. 23 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph and 49 % for residents at 0. 45 false-positive annotations per chest radiograph. Figure of merit did not change significantly for any of the observers after using CAD. CAD marked between five and 16 cancers that were initially missed by the readers. These correctly CAD-depicted lesions were rejected by radiologists in 92 % of cases and by residents in 77 % of cases. Conclusion: The sensitivity of <b>CAD</b> in identifying <b>lung</b> cancers depicted with CT screening was similar to that of experienced radiologists. However, CAD did not improve cancer detection because, especially for subtle lesions, observers were unable to sufficiently differentiate true-positive from false-positive annotations.

40|$|Abstract—When lung nodules {{overlap with}} ribs or clavicles in chest radiographs, {{it can be}} {{difficult}} for radiologists as well as computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes to detect these nodules. In this paper, we developed an image-processing technique for suppressing the contrast of ribs and clavicles in chest radiographs by means of a multiresolution massive training artificial neural network (MTANN). An MTANN is a highly nonlinear filter that can be trained by use of input chest radiographs and the corresponding “teaching ” images. We employed “bone ” images obtained by use of a dual-energy subtraction technique as the teaching images. For effective suppression of ribs having various spatial frequencies, we developed a multiresolution MTANN consisting of multiresolution decomposition/composition techniques and three MTANNs for three different-resolution images. After training with input chest radiographs and the corresponding dual-energy bone images, the multiresolution MTANN was able to provide “bone-image-like” images which were similar to the teaching bone images. By sub-tracting the bone-image-like images from the corresponding chest radiographs, we were able to produce “soft-tissue-image-like” images where ribs and clavicles were substantially suppressed. We used a validation test database consisting of 118 chest radio-graphs with pulmonary nodules and an independent test database consisting of 136 digitized screen-film chest radiographs with 136 solitary pulmonary nodules collected from 14 medical institutions in this study. When our technique was applied to nontraining chest radiographs, ribs and clavicles in the chest radiographs were suppressed substantially, while the visibility of nodules and lung vessels was maintained. Thus, our image-processing technique for rib suppression by means of a multiresolution MTANN would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as for CAD schemes in detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs.
