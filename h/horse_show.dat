5|$|Arabians are {{versatile}} {{horses that}} compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, {{as well as}} dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses {{for those who are}} not interested in competition.|$|E
5|$|JB Kobask, a {{purebred}} Arabian stallion foaled in 1983, {{became the}} first live horse mascot for the Broncos in 1993 after a successful <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> career. He was a son of the reserve U.S. National Champion Arabian Stallion GG Jabask, and a grandson of the Polish-bred Arabian *Bask, a multiple U.S. National Champion after his importation to the United States. JB Kobask also had {{a substantial amount of}} Crabbet breeding in his pedigree.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} an avid horseman. His saddle mare, Lucky Nira, won many <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> {{throughout}} the 1920s and 1930s. His third wife, Andrea, also held many <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> at their country estate.|$|R
50|$|In February 1933 the {{original}} name, the Association of American <b>Horse</b> <b>Shows,</b> Inc., {{was changed to}} the American <b>Horse</b> <b>Shows</b> Association, Inc. At the same meeting, individual members were recognized in addition to show members.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the year, {{the park}} hosts <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> rodeos, {{and other special}} events at the Tropical Park Equestrian Center. The equestrian center hosts over 30 <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> a year, {{including}} international shows. The old racetrack's stables were used {{as part of the}} equestrian center.|$|R
5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and children. Today, it is still used for working cattle, as well as endurance riding and pleasure riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain <b>Horse</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{can carry}} adults {{and in many}} cases compete on equal terms with larger equines while doing so. For example, in 2010, the New Forest Pony Enthusiasts Club (NFPEC), a {{registered}} riding club whose members compete only on purebred registered New Forest ponies, won the Quadrille competition at the London International <b>Horse</b> <b>Show</b> at Olympia. This was a significant win, as the British Riding Clubs Quadrille is a national competition, with only four teams from the whole of Britain selected to compete at the National Final.|$|E
5|$|Dunn's {{training}} facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn {{moved to}} north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training at a time, and had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking <b>Horse</b> <b>show</b> in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers {{who hope to}} enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year.|$|E
5000|$|Rodeos {{and horse}} pulling {{competitions}} are not technically <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> {{but they are}} competitive equestrian events, often {{with a great deal}} of prize money. Equestrian vaulting is not usually seen at ordinary <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> even though it is an FEI-recognized equestrian sport. Games, such as Gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition are usually held separately from ordinary <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> though a few of these [...] "speed" [...] events may be thrown in as [...] "fun classes," [...] particularly at 4-H, Pony Club, and other small shows.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Horse</b> <b>shows</b> in the United States {{take several}} forms: Some are {{restricted}} to a particular breed, others are [...] "open" [...] or [...] "all-breed" [...] <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> which offer both classes open to all breeds as well as breed-specific classes for many different breeds. In the last few decades, American [...] "open" [...] <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> have tended to become specialized by discipline into hunter-jumper or [...] "sport horse" [...] shows, dressage shows, and shows featuring English or Western riding events. However, {{there are still some}} multi-day, all-breed events that feature multiple breeds and disciplines.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was also used}} for <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> and livestock.|$|R
5|$|Each year, the Trait du Nord is {{honored at}} an {{agricultural}} show and <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> in Paris. In 1995, the breed won the International Workhorse Trophy at the Paris show and in 2010, a Trait du Nord {{took the first}} place prize for weight pulling at the show. Trait du Nord teams participate in the Route du Poisson, a relay race commemorating the route that teams took to bring fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris until the 19th century. The race takes place {{every two or three}} years and is the biggest equine relay race in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} are shown {{annually}} at the Paris International Agricultural Show. There are fairs {{held for the}} breed at Lessay and Gavray, in Manche. The National Stud at Saint-Lo remains involved in the maintenance {{and development of the}} breed, and organizes the annual national competition for the breed. The stud also organizes events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy <b>Horse</b> <b>Show.</b> The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} her goal, Varian {{sought the}} assistance of British horse breeder Patricia Lindsay, who traveled to Poland and purchased three mares on Varian's behalf. The mares arrived in California in December 1961. They were Bachantka (sired by Wielki Szlem out of Balalajka, who was by Amurath Sahib), purchased from the Albigowa stud; Ostroga (Duch × Orda by Omar 11), from the Nowy Dwór stud; and Naganka (Bad Afas × Najada by Fetysz), from the Michalow stud. Bachantka and Naganka had been trained and raced in Poland. Bachantka had a record of 2/15 (0-1-3), and Naganka a record of 2/12 (3-4-1). After her arrival in the USA, Bachantka also had a brief but successful <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> career.|$|E
50|$|Landon Arena {{has been}} the venue for many concerts, family shows, trade <b>shows,</b> {{consumer}} <b>shows,</b> <b>horse</b> <b>shows,</b> dog shows {{and all kinds of}} exhibitions.|$|R
50|$|On January 20, 1917, {{representatives of}} some fifty <b>horse</b> <b>shows</b> met in Manhattan under the {{leadership}} of Reginald C. Vanderbilt. Their intention was to unite in order to assure clean competition in the show ring. They formed the Association of American <b>Horse</b> <b>Shows,</b> which by its first annual meeting on January 29, 1918, included the organizers of 26 well-known <b>horse</b> <b>shows.</b> The association incorporated in June 1918. Membership grew to list 35 member shows in 1919, and 67 shows by 1924. By the time of Mr. Vanderbilt's death in 1925, the organization had enrolled almost 70 shows as members of the organization.|$|R
50|$|Clearview Farm, an all-breed {{boarding}} {{facility that}} also hosts <b>horse</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dunn {{trained and}} showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and {{during his career}} won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, {{competing}} in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual <b>horse</b> <b>show,</b> the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so popular that he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{resulted}} in many Haflingers being taken into military {{service and the}} interruption of breeding programs. After the war, {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Saint Germain, South Tyrol (including Hafling) was ceded to Italy, while North Tyrol remained in Austria. This split was extremely detrimental to the Haflinger breed, as most of the brood mares were in South Tyrol in what was now Italy, while the high-quality breeding stallions had been kept at studs in North Tyrol and so were still in Austria. Little effort at cooperation was made between breeders in North and South Tyrol, and in the 1920s a new Horse Breeders' Commission was established in Bolzano in Italy, which was given governmental authority to inspect state-owned breeding stallions, register privately owned stallions belonging to Commission members, and give prize money for <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> competition. The Commission governed the breeding of the Italian population of both the Haflinger and the Noriker horse. In 1921, because of the lack of breeding stallions in Italy, a crossbred Sardinian-Arabian stallion was used for the Haflinger breeding program, as well as many lower-quality purebred Haflingers.|$|E
25|$|Zahoor elahi stadium was {{previously}} known as <b>Horse</b> <b>show</b> Ground. The reason {{behind this name}} was a <b>horse</b> <b>show</b> which was held here annually till late nineties. It was rebuilt during the year 2001 and 2002. After the renovation in March, 2002 <b>Horse</b> <b>show</b> ground was renamed as Zahoor Elahi sadium in honour of the late politician Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi.|$|E
