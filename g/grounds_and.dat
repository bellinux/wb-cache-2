5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} estuaries of Hilton Head Island are {{the feeding}} grounds, breeding <b>grounds,</b> <b>and</b> nurseries for many saltwater species of game fish, sport fish, and marine mammals. The dense plankton population gives the coastal water its murky brown-green coloration.|$|E

40|$|The {{notions of}} <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ontological {{dependence}} {{have made a}} prominent resurgence in much of contemporary metaphysics. However, objections have been raised. On the one hand, objections have been raised {{to the need for}} distinctively metaphysical notions of <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ontological dependence. On the other, objections have been raised to the usefulness of adding <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ontological dependence to the existing store of other metaphysical notions. Even the logical properties of <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ontological dependence are under debate. In this article, I focus on how to account for the judgements of non-symmetry in several of the cases that motivate the introduction of notions like <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ontological dependence. By focusing on the notion of explanation relative to a theory, I conclude that we do not need to postulate a distinctively asymmetric metaphysical notion in order to account for these judgements...|$|R
50|$|In 1896, Mears and {{his brother}} Joseph {{purchased}} the Stamford Bridge Athletics <b>Ground</b> <b>and</b> later the nearby market garden {{with the intention of}} turning it into the country's finest football <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> staging high-profile matches there. He failed to persuade Fulham FC chairman Henry Norris to re-locate his club to the <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> considered selling the land to the Great Western Railway Company, who wished {{to use it as a}} coal yard.|$|R

5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor <b>grounds,</b> <b>and</b> the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting <b>grounds</b> <b>and</b> their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} approaches to the absolute radiometric calibration of the two reflective channels of the NOAA AVHRR sensors are presented. The first method involves <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric measurements and reference to another calibrated satellite sensor. The second involves <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric measurements with no reference to another sensor, while the third method involves no <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> atmospheric measurements but reference to another sensor. NOAA- 9 and NOAA- 10 AVHRR data sets are presented...|$|R
50|$|In New Brunswick, {{the provincial}} {{government}} agency responsible for coordinating volunteer <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> inland water SAR is the New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization.

5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments.

5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting <b>grounds</b> <b>and</b> sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Major-General Charles Blackader {{left the}} {{division}} on medical <b>grounds</b> <b>and</b> {{was replaced by}} Major-General Thomas Cubitt.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol <b>grounds</b> <b>and</b> the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
5|$|During British rule, Secunderabad {{became a}} {{well-known}} sporting centre and many race courses, parade <b>grounds</b> <b>and</b> polo fields were built.

In more recent times, motorsports has become popular with the Andhra Pradesh Motor Sports Club organising popular events such as the Deccan ¼ Mile Drag, TSD Rallies and 4x4 off-road rallying.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental <b>grounds,</b> <b>and</b> {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
