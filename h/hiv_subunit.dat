40|$|The {{secondary}} structure of HIV- 1 gp 120 was predicted using multiple alignment and {{a combination of}} two independent methods based on neural network and nearest-neighbor algorithms. The methods agreed on the {{secondary structure}} for 80 % of the residues in BH 10 gp 120. Six helices were predicted in HIV strain BH 10 gp 120 {{as well as in}} 27 other HIV- 1 strains examined. Two helical segments were predicted in regions displaying profound sequence variation, one in a region suggested to be critical for CD 4 binding. The predicted content of helix, fi-strand, and coil was consistent with estimates from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The predicted secondary structure of gp 120 compared well with data from NMR analysis of synthetic peptides from the V 3 loop and the C 4 region. As a first step towards modeling the tertiary structure of gp 120, the predicted secondary structure may guide the design of future <b>HIV</b> <b>subunit</b> vaccine candidates. 3 Introduction Sequences from different clones of the [...] ...|$|E

All injections contained adjuvant MF 59, and subjects were grouped according to MTP-PE dose. Injections were given on days 0, 30, 180, and 365. The vaccine was well tolerated with limited local and systemic reactions. These immunizations in-duced rgp 120 s Frspecific binding antibodies that persisted ~ 24 weeks. After three immuniza-tions, all subjects receiving the antigen developed neutralizing antibodies to HIVSF 2, and serum from 67 % of these subjects also cross-neutralized HIVMN ' ELISA-reactive antibodies to the HIVSF 2 V 3 region and strong lymphoproliferative responses to HIVSF 2 envelope proteins were detected in all rgp 120 sF 2 - immunized subjects.

40|$|AbstractImproving the potency, breadth, and {{durability}} of neutralizing antibody responses to HIV are major challenges for HIV vaccine development. To address these challenges, the studies described evaluate in rabbits the titers, breadth, and epitope specificities of antibody responses elicited by <b>HIV</b> envelope <b>subunit</b> vaccines adjuvanted with MF 59 {{with or without}} CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). Animals were immunized with trimeric o-gp 140 ΔV 2 derived from subtype B HIV- 1 SF 162 or subtype C HIV- 1 TV 1, or proteins from both strains. Immunization with SF 162 or TV 1 with MF 59 /CpG elicited higher titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies to SF 162 than monovalent immunization with MF 59 alone (P< 0. 01). Bivalent immunization increased binding and neutralizing antibody titers over single envelope immunization in MF 59 (P< 0. 01). Bivalent immunization also improved neutralization breadth. Epitope mapping indicated neutralizing activity in rabbits was directed to V 3 and V 4. Overall, our data suggests that a multivalent vaccination approach with MF 59 and CpG can enhance humoral responses to HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|Conserved regions on the HIV- 1 {{envelope}} spike {{are important}} for vaccine design due to their vulnerability to antibodies that can block virus infectivity – termed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The CD 4 -binding site (CD 4 bs) on the <b>HIV</b> spike <b>subunit</b> gp 120 is one such region. Eliciting antibody responses to the CD 4 bs is difficult because it is surrounded by sequence-variable segments. Here, I conducted immunizations in mice to investigate approaches to focus NAb responses to the CD 4 bs. I found that formulating gp 120 mutants that preferentially expose the CD 4 bs with the saponin adjuvant QuilA improved CD 4 bs-directed responses; however neutralizing activity was not enhanced. In subsequent work I found that priming animals with a gp 120 mutant fused to a string of pathogen-derived CD 4 T-helper epitopes followed by booster injections with alternate gp 120 constructs that differentially present the CD 4 bs elicited higher antibody titers and improved neutralizing activity. Overall, my work provides insight into strategies for focusing antibody responses to desired epitope targets with relevance to HIV vaccine design...|$|R
40|$|The {{envelope}} (Env) glycoprotein {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is the major target of neutralizing antibody responses {{and is likely to}} be a critical component of an effective vaccine against AIDS. Although monomeric <b>HIV</b> envelope <b>subunit</b> vaccines (gp 120) have induced high-titer antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies against laboratory-adapted HIV- 1 strains, they have failed to induce neutralizing antibodies against diverse heterologous primary HIV isolates. Most probably, the reason for this failure is that the antigenic structure(s) of these previously used immunogens does not mimic that of the functional HIV envelope, which is a trimer, and thus these immunogens do not elicit high titers of relevant functional antibodies. We recently reported that an Env glycoprotein immunogen (o-gp 140 SF 162 V 2) containing a partial deletion in the second variable loop (V 2) derived from the R 5 -tropic HIV- 1 isolate SF 162, when used in a DNA priming-protein boosting vaccine regimen in rhesus macaques, induced neutralizing antibodies against heterologous subtype B primary isolates as well as protection to the vaccinated animals upon challenge with pathogenic SHIVSF 162 P 4 virus.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus, generated during {{contact between}} HIV-infected cells and the apical surface of an epithelial cell, can cross a tight epithelial barrier by transcytosis. We show that transcytosis of primary HIV isolates is blocked by dimeric IgA or IgM against HIV envelope proteins. Neutralization occurs intracellularly within the apical recycling endosome, and immune complexes are specifically recycled to the mucosal surface. One epitope involved in neutralization is a conserved {{sequence of the}} gp 41 <b>HIV</b> envelope protein <b>subunit.</b> Finally, transcytosis also occurs across functional human mucosal tissue in a process inhibited by a serosal internalization of IgM against the HIV envelope protein.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in combating the {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) epidemic {{is the development of}} vaccines capable of inducing potent, persistent cellular immunity and broadly reactive neutralizing antibody responses to HIV type 1 (HIV- 1). We report here the results of a preclinical trial using the chimpanzee model to investigate a combination vaccine strategy involving sequential priming immunizations with different serotypes of adenovirus (Ad) /HIV- 1 MNenv/rev recombinants and boosting with an <b>HIV</b> envelope <b>subunit</b> protein, oligomeric HIVSF 162 gp 140 ΔV 2. The immunogenicities of replicating and nonreplicating Ad/HIV- 1 MNenv/rev recombinants were compared. Replicating Ad/HIV recombinants were better at eliciting HIV-specific cellular immune responses and better at priming humoral immunity against HIV than nonreplicating Ad-HIV recombinants carrying the same gene insert. Enhanced cellular immunity was manifested by a greater frequency of HIV envelope-specific gamma interferon-secreting peripheral blood lymphocytes and better priming of T-cell proliferative responses. Enhanced humoral immunity was seen in higher anti-envelope binding and neutralizing antibody titers and better induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. More animals primed with replicating Ad recombinants mounted neutralizing antibodies against heterologous R 5 viruses after one or two booster immunizations with the mismatched oligomeric HIV- 1 SF 162 gp 140 ΔV 2 protein. These results support continued development of the replicating Ad-HIV recombinant vaccine approach and suggest that the use of replicating vectors for other vaccines may prove fruitful...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground Galanthus nivalis {{agglutinin}} (GNA), a mannose-specific lectin from snowdrop bulbs, is a tetrameric {{member of}} the family of Amaryllidaceae lectins that exhibit antiviral activity towards <b>HIV.</b> Its <b>subunits</b> are composed of three pseudo-symmetrically related β sheet domains, each with a conserved mannose-binding site. Crystal structures of monosaccharide and disaccharide complexes of GNA have revealed that all 12 binding sites of the tetramer are functional, and that the degree of occupancy is dependent on the availability of subsidiary interactions from neighboring subunits. The complex of GNA with a branched mannopentaose ((Manα 1, 6 -(α 1, 3 -Man) Man-α 1, 6 -(α 1, 3 -Man) Man) described here simulates a more biologically relevant complex. Results Two unique mannopentaose binding modes co-exist in the tetragonal structure (1 subunit/asymmetric unit) of the complex. In one, the conserved monosaccharide-binding pocket in domain 1 (CRD 1) is utilized for cross-linkage of twofold related GNA dimers by the outer 3, 6 tri-Man arm, which alternates between two orientations consistent with crystal symmetry. Inter-linked dimers assemble helically along the 41 crystal axis forming a pore-like structure. In the second binding mode, the complete 3, 6 tri-Man arm binds to an extended binding region in domain 3 (CRD 3) with subsites for each terminal Man and the internal Man positioned in the conserved monosaccharide pocket. The two remaining mannose residues are not visible in either binding mode. Conclusions This structure provides insights into possible mechanisms of the cross-linkage that is known to occur when lectins interact with specific multivalent cell surface receptors during events such as agglutination and mitogenic stimulation. By virtue of the large number of sites available for mannose binding, GNA has multiple possibilities of forming unique lattice structures. The two distinctly different binding modes observed in this study confirm that high affinity mannose binding occurs only at the two domain sites located near dimer interfaces...|$|R

A strong neutralizing antibody response to the Ad 7 vector developed within 1 week of infection. A subsequent booster inoculation 12 weeks later with the heterotypic Ad 4 -env recombinant virus resulted in significantly enhanced humoral responses directed at the envelope antigen, as measured by both ELISA and Western blot analysis as well as high-titer type-specific neutralizing antibodies, with some animals achieving neutralization titers approaching 1000.

Here we describe the purification of this protein to homogeneity, its characterization as trimer, and its ability to induce primary isolate-neutralizing responses in rhesus macaques. Optimal mutations in the primary and secondary protease cleavage sites of the env gene were identified that resulted in the stable secretion of a trimeric Env glycoprotein in mammalian cell cultures. We determined the molecular mass and hydrodynamic radius (Rh) using a triple detector analysis (TDA) system. The molecular mass of the oligomer was found to be 324 kDa, close to the expected Mw of a HIV envelope trimer protein (330 kDa), and the hydrodynamic radius was 7. 27 nm. Negative staining electron microscopy of o-gp 140 SF 162 ΔV 2 showed that it is a trimer with considerable structural flexibility and supported the data obtained by TDA. The structural integrity of the purified trimeric protein was also confirmed by determinations of its ability to bind the HIV receptor, CD 4, and its ability to bind a panel of well-characterized neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. No deleterious effect of V 2 loop deletion was observed on the structure and conformation of the protein, and several critical neutralization epitopes were preserved and well exposed on the purified o-gp 140 SF 162 ΔV 2 protein. In an intranasal priming and intramuscular boosting regimen, this protein induced high titers of functional antibodies, which neutralized the vaccine strain, i. e., SF 162. These results highlight a potential role for the trimeric o-gp 140 SF 162 ΔV 2 Env immunogen in a successful HIV vaccine...|$|R
40|$|In {{the global}} AIDS epidemic, {{over half of}} all infections have {{occurred}} in people less than 25 years old resulting in profound social, economic and demographic consequences. Current estimates indicate that the present 15 million HIV infections will increase to over 30 million {{by the end of}} the millennium. For most countries a safe and effective vaccine offers the only hope of controlling the spread of this disease. The development of an effective vaccine against HIV is beset with formidable obstacles. Despite these difficulties, substantial progress has been made towards developing effective strategies for vaccination. Human clinical trials and animal models for AIDS, particularly simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques, have proved invaluable in this quest. Inactivated virus vaccines induced potent protection in this model, but subsequent studies revealed that protection was mediated by antibody to cellular proteins present in the vaccine preparations and on the surface of infecting virions. This surprising observation has provided an alternative and complementary approach to the development of vaccines against HIV in man which is still being pursued. Live attenuated vaccines were initially dismissed as far too hazardous. However, the concept has recently been reexamined in the light of powerful evidence that attenuated SIV induces potent protection against a wide variety of viruses administered by intravenous or mucosal routes and even against challenge with viable virus-infected spleen cells. Efforts are now underway to understand the mechanism of this protection and to attempt to reproduce it by less hazardous means. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of <b>subunit</b> <b>HIV</b> vaccines, predominantly based on the envelope glycoproteins of the virus. Extensive clinical trials in human volunteers have established that these vaccines are safe and antigenic. However, the immune responses appear to be transient and the antibodies induced do not neutralize the primary isolates of HIV which are circulating in the population. There are now three possible approaches to an AIDS vaccine which are being actively pursued...|$|R
