5|$|Soon {{after its}} discovery, Marsh {{considered}} Stegosaurus {{to have been}} bipedal, due to its short forelimbs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind, however, by 1891, after considering the heavy build of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Edmund FitzAlan {{was born}} in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, {{daughter}} of Thomas I of Saluzzo in Italy. Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E
5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} his 2011 season saw him take a fourth {{consecutive}} national title over 60m with a European-leading time. At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships the following month he was beaten to the line by Obikwelu, although he {{was pleased with the}} silver medal as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his training to focus towards the 100m for that season. Four straight wins on the Brazilian Athletics Tour came {{at the beginning of his}} outdoor season in May, including a season's best of 10.01seconds, and he took his fifth national title at the British trials. At the 2011 World Championships he reached the 100m semi-finals but fell foul of the IAAF's new false start rule: he twitched in his blocks and was immediately disqualified.|$|E
5|$|Leterrier and Roth were {{originally}} contracted to return. Leterrier also stated Norton was not signed on, but in October 2008, Hurd stated that Norton was contracted to reprise the role. The film had outgrossed its predecessor and Universal indicated {{interest in a}} sequel, though Leterrier believed a sequel would not be made because of the film's box office return. Feige said the film met Marvel's expectations and that Hulk would return, but after the crossover. Hurd was not concerned that a sequel may not be produced until at least 2012, citing the positive reception to the film and having produced the Terminator series, {{the second and third}} film of which had a 12-year gap. Tim Roth confirmed that Marvel had signed him for three more films. Leterrier, after having previously said {{he did not want to}} direct a sequel, said in late 2009 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind and was now amenable.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind and supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E

5|$|Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} driver {{in the history of}} Formula One to take pole position, with a time of 1:37.555 in very wet conditions. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kovalainen. Mark Webber qualified third after his final lap pushed Sébastien Bourdais into fourthposition. Massa took sixthposition behind Rosberg. Trulli, Fernando Alonso, Glock and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Kubica qualified 11th, blaming late rain in the second qualifying session for his position. Fisichella qualified 12th to give Force India its best grid position of the season. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton blamed a late entry into the second session for their poor qualifying times, which saw them eliminated in 14th and 15th positions, respectively. Hamilton originally ran on the standard wet-weather tyres, and by the time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> to extreme wet-weather tyres the rain had intensified. This was McLaren's only result outside the top ten in qualifying all season and the first time in Hamilton's career that he had failed to progress into the final qualifying session.|$|E

His son by his second marriage is Victor Bulmer-Thomas, formerly Director of Chatham House.|$|E

25|$|In McCain's {{campaign}} for the presidency in 2000, he supported the federal ban on offshore drilling for oil. In June 2008, McCain reversed his longstanding objection to offshore drilling.

25|$|Refereeing in Scotland {{came under}} intense media {{attention}} in 2010 after a controversial incident on 17 October, during an SPL game between Dundee United and Celtic, which Celtic won 2–1. When {{the score was}} level at 1–1, referee Dougie McDonald awarded a penalty kick to Celtic. He then quickly reversed his initial decision after consulting with assistant referee Steven Craven. Celtic officials heavily criticised the decision to not award a penalty after the game. After Craven resigned on 25 October, it emerged that he and McDonald had lied to his supervisor, Jim McBurney, and to Celtic manager Neil Lennon about the decision making process. McDonald had claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind after consulting with Craven, when in fact <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind himself before consulting Craven. This revelation prompted {{an investigation by the}} SFA, which resulted in McDonald receiving an official warning on 29 October, while also upholding the actual decision.|$|E
25|$|Swedenborg {{proposed}} many scientific ideas {{during his}} lifetime. In his youth, {{he wanted to}} present a new idea every day, as {{he wrote to his}} brother-in-law Erik Benzelius in 1718. Around 1730, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{a column}} had been formed with the {{intention}} to attack simultaneously the rebels in Rotunda, a plan that was never carried out because of the order to retreat. The column reached Rossio in the evening without having joined combat. This inaction was not caused by the incompetence of its commander, General António Carvalhal, as would become clear the next day, when he was named chief of the Military Division for the republican government: <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> sides.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experts who}} {{observed}} video evidence suggested Mehserle might have confused his gun for his Taser, {{causing him to}} mistakenly believe he was tasering Grant. If Mehserle thought he was firing his Taser, this could provide a full or partial defense to the murder charge. It depended on whether Mehserle had a legal right to use his Taser at all, which was questioned. Prosecutors alleged that paperwork, including a blood alcohol test, completed by Mehserle after the shooting showed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his story about what occurred.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Carlyle's {{death in}} 1881, Froude {{published}} Carlyle's Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle.

On {{the basis of this}} note, she accused Froude of misconduct in publishing the volume, even though the fact that Carlyle had given the volume to Froude five years later suggested that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> his mind.
