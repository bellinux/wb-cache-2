5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders {{to ensure that}} they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

500|$|Time {{ranked the}} album number nine, with the publication's Claire Suddath writing that [...] "It's {{an amalgam of}} beats, chants and raps mixed {{together}} with exacting precision. Big Boi deftly jumps between musical styles [...] and his raps come so fast, he seems to never pause for breath". Pitchfork Media named it the fourth best album of 2010 and stated [...] "he sound of Sir Lucious Left Foot <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> recognizing traditions and pushing them miles ahead. Big Boi crowns it all with a lyrical acumen so detailed and charismatic—acting as benevolent hustler, knuckle-dusting elder statesman, trickster smartass and street-level philosopher". It was voted the sixth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010, while 11 songs from the album {{were included in the}} poll's singles list, including [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] (number seven), [...] "Shine Blockas" [...] (number 95), and [...] "Follow Us" [...] (number 316).

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Tippett {{produced}} three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). [...] The symphony, {{written in the}} manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen [...] "the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". [...] The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> [...] "finding a sound" [...] that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments [...] perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.|$|E

James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is {{an order of magnitude}} worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E

Jim Farber of the Daily News said the [...] "jerry-built" [...] sound the band used for the album [...] "isn't {{anything}} to be admired". MusicOMH reviewer Alex Nunn, gave the album two stars out of five and said, [...] "Musically it's power chords and big riffs-ahoy, generic, mundane, boring stuff. The Open Door <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> how {{not to make a}} sophomore album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of Jam! also rated The Open Door with two stars, highlighting Lee's voice and criticizing the [...] "lather, rinse, repeat" [...] formula used for making the songs on the [...] record. He further explained the songs together make a [...] "monotonous blast of self-indulgent Evanonsense", concluding that [...] "some door are better off staying closed". Andy Gill of The Independent also criticized The Open Door and said Lee's narrow vocal range was mirrored in the [...] "restricted breadth of the band's musical and emotional range, which never strays outside the short distance from paranoid to apocalyptic, concerns addressed in as bombastic and tune-dodging a manner as possible". At the 2007 NRJ Music Awards, The Open Door received a nomination for Best International Album of the Year, and the album won Album of the Year at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards. One of the album's songs, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", was nominated in the category of Best Hard Rock Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards.|$|E

[...] That is, [...] "for the most part, experimental music studies describes [...] a category without really explaining it" [...] He finds laudable exceptions in the work of David Nicholls and, especially, Amy Beal , and concludes from their work that [...] "The fundamental ontological shift that marks experimentalism as an achievement is that from representationalism to performativity", so that [...] "an explanation of experimentalism that already assumes the category it purports to explain <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> metaphysics, not ontology" [...]|$|E

It was originally built for Judge Chapman in 1875 and christened [...] "Woodside", though it has been known throughout much of its history as [...] "Castlamore". This imposing structure sits on the slopes of the Dunedin Botanic Gardens close to the University of Otago, and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> restraint. The castle atmosphere is there, almost a Scottish baronial castle, but the battlements are merely hinted at by stepped gables. Large bay windows, allowing light to flood in, again merely hint at the Gothic; one has to study them closely to perceive that they consist of a series of lancet type windows. The large octagonal chimneys reflect the design rather than being ostentatious.|$|E
2500|$|A good plot <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> proper balance. [...] By staying {{aware of}} the scenes' levels of {{intensity}} and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers. [...] Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight. [...] However, in writing fiction, they {{are in charge of}} the way time moves. [...] They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely. [...] Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about. [...] There is a time for telling and a time for showing. [...] Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly. [...] On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace. [...] Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension. [...] In the rising action of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene. [...] The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} of a Singapore public authority {{was found to}} be Wednesbury unreasonable in Mir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman v Attorney-General (2009). The case concerned a {{decision of}} the Strata Titles Board (STB) not to reschedule a hearing date for the approval of a condominium's sale and purchase agreement. The applicants, who were representatives of a sales committee representing the owners of units in a condominium, had agreed to sell the condominium to certain purchasers. Under the agreement between the parties, the applicants were required to obtain the STB's approval for the transaction by 25 July 2008. However, the STB only scheduled a hearing on 7 August 2008. Unable to obtain the purchaser's approval to extend the deadline, the applicants applied for the hearing date to be brought forward, but the application was dismissed by the registrar of the STB. Upon an application for judicial review of this decision, the High Court held that [...] "the STB's decision to schedule the resumed hearing on 7 August 2008, which is beyond its mandate and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> futility, was, in the circumstances of this case, unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense".|$|E
