5|$|Takten Hermitage (Rtags bstan ri khrod) is {{situated}} {{to the east}} of Trashi Chöling Hermitage and to the north-east of Sera. According to a legend, Dge lugs pa bla ma, Pha bong kha bde chen snying po (1878–1941) on a visit to this area to find a site for locating his hermitage saw a crow which spoke to him. He interpreted it as a “revealed sign” to build his hermitage here. The hermitage mostly consists of caves with fascia {{at the entrance to the}} caves. It belongs to the Pabongkha Lama’s estate (Pha bong kha bla brang). Yes <b>i</b> <b>agree</b> However, Dge lugs pa nuns, who have carried out restoration works at the hermitage now live here.|$|E

25|$|I {{frequently}} have differed with {{the opinions of}} Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily {{explained by the fact}} that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.|$|E
500|$|Of her character's changes after season five, Kirshner stated: [...] "I think she'll {{continue}} {{to be just like}} a tumbleweed and a car crash and I'm happy for that, I don't want it to be wrapped up. She'll never be normal and that's just the way it is." [...] Responding to the criticism Jenny has received, Kirshner states: [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with what's said about the character for the most part. But again... it's my job. So, I mean, it's a fun character." ...|$|E

500|$|In a July 2012 {{interview}} with E! News, Colfer elaborated {{in regard to}} the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, [...] "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [...] and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that." [...] In September 2012, Criss echoed Colfer's sentiment, [...] "We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!" ...|$|E
500|$|Audi's WRC {{programme}} {{was limited}} for the 1985 season {{due to the}} recent defeats to Peugeot Talbot Sport, Peugeot's factory team headed by Jean Todt. Mouton and Mikkola were assigned to testing and development duties. She drove both the Sport Quattro and its follower, the Quattro S1 (Sport E2). Mouton considered the S1 the most difficult rally car she had driven: [...] "For rallying on asphalt, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> the limit had gone too far. We {{did not have the}} reflexes to control it properly. It was tough to drive the car, but not the short Quattro before." ...|$|E

[...] In September 2012, Criss seconded Colfer, [...] "We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!" ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{observed}} that Burton {{was more interested}} in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and <b>I</b> <b>agree.</b> That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at Wayne Manor," [...] Hamm said.|$|E
500|$|Jerry {{tries to}} apologize, even going {{as far as}} to compare ponies with compact cars, but Manya gets even more angry and leaves the table. Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others {{that he did not know}} she had a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony." [...] But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died. Jerry is very upset about it, but he's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship.|$|E
500|$|Later in June, Feige {{stated the}} film was still {{intended}} to be released on the July 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014. Feige elaborated that [...] "much of the movie will still be based very much on [...] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. [...] " [...] {{wanted to be sure}} that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad," [...] Feige continued. [...] "He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Though former Nickelodeon {{president}} Albie Hecht, a Jewish person himself, was dumbfounded by {{the accusation}} and deemed it absurd, Herb Scannell, {{president of the}} company in 1998, responded to the complaints and apologized to ADL. Scannell issued a statement promising that neither the strip nor the character would ever be published again. In the statement, he also noted, [...] "Unfortunately, the creators of the strip made an error in judgment by referencing the Kaddish. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you that, however well-meaning, the use of the Kaddish in the comic strip was inappropriate." [...] Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, responded via a press release in which they thanked Scannell for his speedy response and commended the company in general for understanding the issue at hand; Foxman concluded by saying, [...] "We appreciate Nickelodeon’s long record of creative and quality programming and understand that it was not their intention to offend." ...|$|E
500|$|Einarr's brother Hallad {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} control in Orkney due to the predations of Danish pirates. He resigned his earldom and returned to Norway as a common landholder, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Hallad's failure led to Rognvald flying into a rage and summoning his sons Thorir and Hrolluag. He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision {{was up to the}} earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir's path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of the natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: [...] "Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to make much of a ruler. But <b>I</b> <b>agree,</b> the sooner you leave and the later you return the happier I'll be." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2016 MacBook Pro {{received}} mixed reviews. Ars Technica {{noted that}} the keyboard was a [...] "drastic departure" [...] from previous MacBook Pro keyboards, being a second-generation version of the keyboard used in the Retina MacBook. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it. Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage. Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price. Wired praised the display, calling it [...] "the best laptop display I've ever seen", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors. Likewise, The Verge concluded that [...] "using [...] is alienating to anyone living in the present. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with Apple's vision of the future. I'm just not buying it today." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means over yet. We will win easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> we had some luck in Amsterdam, but I am sure we will go through." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And <b>I</b> <b>agree,</b> It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
