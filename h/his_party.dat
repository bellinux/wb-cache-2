5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change <b>his</b> <b>party</b> affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change <b>his</b> <b>party</b> affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted <b>his</b> <b>party</b> switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin's {{campaign}} ended {{after receiving}} 199,314 or 0.15% {{of the popular}} vote on Election Day. He finished in fifth place, but won the largest percentage of votes for <b>his</b> <b>party</b> since Howard Phillips in 1996. 14,865 of his votes were won in Michigan, but he won his largest percentage in Utah with 1.26% of the state's votes.|$|E
50|$|Incumbent Mark Ritchie won {{endorsement}} at the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) convention. He faced only token {{opposition in}} <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> primary from perennial candidate Dick Franson, and easily won <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> nomination in the August 10, 2010 primary.|$|R
50|$|Incumbent Abdullah Dimaporo is in {{his third}} {{consecutive}} term already and is ineligible for reelection. His daughter Fatima is <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for the district's seat while his wife, former governor Imelda Dimaporo is <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for the first district.|$|R
50|$|The Congress {{was called}} by PSOE Secretary-General Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba after <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> poor results at the 2014 European Parliament election, garnering just 23% of the vote. Rubalcaba {{announced}} his intention not to run for either <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> leadership or for the 2015 Spanish general election.|$|R
5|$|Ed Stelmach succeeded Klein as premier, {{following}} his win {{of the leadership}} of the Alberta Progressive Conservative party in 2006. He won the 2008 provincial election, but, troubled by dissension within <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> resigned as the party celebrated its 40 years in power in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Following his resignation, Breckinridge shifted <b>his</b> <b>party</b> {{affiliation}} from Whig to Know-Nothing to Republican. In 1853, {{he helped}} found Danville Theological Seminary in Danville, Kentucky, becoming a Professor of Exegetic, Didactic and Polemic Theology.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, and too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and <b>his</b> <b>party</b> member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Muñoz Rivera ran for Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives {{representing}} the Union of Puerto Rico party, and served from 1911 to 1916. After spending {{nearly a year}} perfecting his English, Muñoz Rivera began forming friendships with some congressmen. Among these were Henry L. Stimpson and Felix Frankfurter. In 1915 Muñoz Rivera proposed granting Puerto Rico greater autonomy without requesting independence from the United States, and equal rights without becoming a state. His proposal was greeted by opposition from many members of <b>his</b> <b>party</b> including José de Diego. Still in the end, <b>his</b> <b>party</b> agreed on his proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Hareide {{announced}} that he had left politics for the time being to pursue a career in the national media conglomerate Schibsted, as an organizational director. His career in the company started with the position of trainee in 1997. Outside politics, his only paid full-time appointments have been in Schibsted. He still works behind the scenes for <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> occasionally commenting on issues in the national media. He did not rule out a return to national politics in the future, and in late 2008 he was selected by <b>his</b> <b>party</b> as the top candidate on the party's ticket in Akershus county. The Christian Democratic Party formerly held a seat in this county, but lost it in 2005. Hareide has never lived in Akershus. Party leader Dagfinn Høybråten hails from Akershus, but he runs on the Rogaland ticket to secure a safe seat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Caxias {{became a member}} of the Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order and finally the Conservative Party. He was elected senator in 1846. The Emperor {{appointed}} him president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) in 1856; he briefly held that office again in 1861, but fell when <b>his</b> <b>party</b> lost its parliamentary majority. Over the decades Caxias witnessed the growth and zenith of <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> then its slow decline as internal conflict divided it. In 1875, he headed a cabinet for the last time, and after years of failing health he died in May 1880.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since <b>his</b> <b>party</b> {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E

5|$|Moran often {{broke with}} <b>his</b> <b>party</b> on {{economic}} issues.

5|$|Murray Robson {{replaced}} Treatt as Leader of the Opposition in August 1954. Like {{other senior}} members of the Liberals, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of <b>his</b> <b>party</b> and fellow parliamentary colleagues and Robson's attempts to forge a closer alliance with Bruxner and the Country Party, failed dismally and alienated him from many in <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> Robson was replaced by Pat Morton as leader in September 1955. Bruxner, now aged 70 and having fallen ill several times, led the Country Party one last time at the March 1956 election, which resulted in another labour victory and Country Party regained the seat of Armidale, but overall the government's majority fell from twenty to six. Bruxner retained Tenterfield unopposed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{president}} of the Council owed his position to both <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> majority in the Legislature (and to <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> willingness to support him in the Chamber) and to the Emperor, and these two sources of authority (parliamentary backing and imperial appointment) could sometimes come into conflict. 19th century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said: ...|$|R
