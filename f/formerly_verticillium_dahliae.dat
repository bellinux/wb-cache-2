40|$|<b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> and V. alfalfae (<b>formerly</b> <b>Verticillium</b> albo-atrum) are two {{important}} agricultural pathogens that affect many crops {{around the world}} and cause a distinct type of vascular wilt, which are known as Verticillium wilts. Several V. alfalfae and V. dahliae genomes have been sequenced, and are among the smaller genomes from filamentous ascomycetes. The number of predicted protein-encoding genes is similar to the saprobe Neurospora crassa. Perhaps reflective of their particular hemibiotrophic life styles, some gene families are expanded in the V. alfalfae and V. dahliae genomes. These include the gene families encoding glycoside hydrolases GH 88, necrosis and ethylene-inducing-like proteins (NLPs), LysM effectors, proteins with chitin-recognition motifs, and cutinases. But the number of predicted secreted proteins was less than half that of the related Colletotrichum species, the agents of anthracnose diseases. V. dahliae strains generally contain lineage-specific regions (LS regions), which may {{play an important role in}} virulence and pathogenicity. Examples for horizontal transfer into Verticillium ancestors include the virulence factor Ave 1, a glucan glucosyltransferase, and potentially some of the retrotransposons. The V. alfalfae and V. dahliae genomes have already had significant impacts on various aspects of basic and applied Verticillium research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferential {{expression}} of genes in cultured cotton cells and leaf disks {{that have been}} challenged with a purified elicitor from <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae,</b> was investigated {{in order to identify}} genes involved in the early defense response of cotton. The mRNA differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to identify differentially expressed genes 5  h after application of 50  μg mL− 1 <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> elicitor. Sequence analysis of selected amplicons revealed homologies with genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrate precursors for cell wall synthesis. cDNAs identified that were up-regulated after elicitor treatment coded for homologs to a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase-like protein, a glucosyltransferase-like protein, a beta- 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, a cellulose synthase-like protein, a 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid transferase-like protein and a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein. In addition, one cell wall-related cDNA that was down-regulated after elicitor treatment, coded for a proline-rich protein family member homolog. The differential {{expression of}} the cDNAs up-regulated after the <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> elicitor treatment was confirmed with reverse Northern dot blots.

40|$|The soil-borne {{pathogenic}} fungus <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> Kleb. causes {{economic losses}} in crops in temperate {{regions of the}} world and hence is the most studied species. Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) belongs to plant species susceptible to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae,</b> although the response to infection caused by this pathogen is varied and depends on the cultivar. Due to a lack of efficient methods in Verticillium wilt elimination, the selection of genetically resistant plant material is a priority direction in breeding programs. Efficacy of resistance selection to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> Kleb. in strawberry tissue culture was examined on the basis of response to in vitro infection by this pathogenic fungus in two tissue cultured strawberry cultivars, i. e. 'Filon' and 'Teresa'. Culture was conducted for 16 months in an environmentally controlled growth room at 18 - 20 °C, 60 - 70 % relative humidity and light intensity of 100 µm E × m - 2 × s - 1 on a 16 h light / 8 h dark cycle. Subcultures were proliferated every 6 weeks on modified Murashige and Skoog medium. Four hundred microplants from each tissue cultured cultivar were inoculated under in vitro conditions at the 4 -leaf stage with a homogenate of liquid mycelium of <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> serving as the selecting agent. Disease symptoms were observed at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 th days post inoculation. The extent of leaf chlorosis was rated on a scale of 0 - 4. At day 75 th post inoculation, the percentage of totally chlorotic plants in micropropagated cv. Teresa reached the value of 76. 27 %, whereas the proportion of such plants in inoculated tissue cultured cv. Filon reached the value of 89. 40 %. Also, the index of infection calculated for very severe disease symptoms in the subclone 'Teresa' reached the mean value lower when compared with that calculated for subclone 'Filon' (0. 0962 and 0. 1150, respectively). These results suggested that the micropropagated cv. Teresa exhibited higher genetic resistance to the selecting agent in comparison with the tissue cultured cv. Filon, and it was consistent with field resistance of both cultivars to this pathogen. Therefore, the procedure of in vitro selection used in this study was quite efficient to distinguish varying genetic resistance to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> in the two examined strawberry subclones, and can be recommended as a suitable method for the estimation of susceptibility to Verticillium wilt in different strawberry genotypes...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} {{study has been}} carried out about resistance and tolerance of cucumber and sweet pepper rootstocks to Meloidogyne spp. and <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae.</b> This study offers an overview of research in practice and international scientific literature. For cucumber no rootstocks are known that are resistant to M. incognita. However rootstocks are available that have a high tolerance and a lower development of eggs and galls on the roots. Within Cucumis sativus especially hardwickii species have a high tolerance for a broad range of nematodes, but not to M. incognita. Tolerance to this nematode is found in related species of cucumber; Sycios angulatus ‘Harry’, Cucumis metuliferus and Cucurbita spp. The thin stem of Hardwickii and Cucumis metuliferus compared to cucumber complicates grafting. For sweet pepper resistance to M. javanica is present within Capsicum anuum and also within other Capsicum species. To M. incognita only partly resistant rootstocks are available. These species are listed in this study. Within Cucurbitaceae resistance is known to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae,</b> likeCucurbita ficifolia. Disadvantages are the lower production of cucumber grafted on these rootstocks and/or the lack of resistance to other pathogens like Phomopsis sclerotioides. For sweet pepper species are found with a high tolerance to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae,</b> but not with complete resistance.

Further back along the root, the densities of microorganisms stabilized, but in some cases the fluorescein diacetate active hyphal density increased. The hyphal densities stopped increasing before bacterial densities, suggesting an increasing bacterial competition for root exudates as their population grew.

40|$|Verticillium wilt {{caused by}} the soilborne {{pathogen}} <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> {{is considered one of}} the most serious and destructive disease of chrysanthemum. After the ban of noxious chemicals for soil fumigation, including methyl bromide, alternative management strategies for control of V. dahliae such as biofumigation have assumed an increasing importance. This environmental friendly method is based on the glucosinolate-myrosinase system contained in Brassica plant cells which, in the presence of water, produces a number of toxic compounds, especially isothiocyanates, released in the soil after incorporation of brassicaceous green manures. Biofumigant products are also available in form of dry pellet or defatted seed meals (DSM) that contained glucosinolates ten times more concentrated than plant tissues. We tested in vitro the sensitivity of three V. dahliae morphologically distinct strains (10353, 10355, 10360) isolated from infected crysanthyemum plants cv. Veneri to two DSM differing in particle size (0. 3 or 1. 0 mm). Moreover, we use two different inoculum type: actively growing mycelium and mycelium derived from pathogen colonized seeds. The DL 90 values were subjected at ANOVA analysis and results showed that: i) 0. 3 mm DSM is more effective than 1 mm DSM, ii) different isolates of <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> show different sensitivity towards biofumigant treatments (10360 > 10353 > 10355), iii) mycelium developed from colonized seeds is less sensitive to the biofumigant treatments than active growing mycelium.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{molecular}} mechanisms of plant defence response to <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae,</b> we identified the genes whose expression patterns were altered during early response to V. dahliae toxins (VD-toxins) in Arabidopsis seedlings using the mRNA differential display approach. Four true positive bands (DD 1, DD 2, DD 3 and DD 4) were confirmed from the 30 differentially displayed bands. The deduced nucleotide sequence of the DD 1 and DD 2 clones showed strong homology with genes encoding a putative histone H 2 B and a pumilio /Puf RNA-binding protein, respectively. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays suggested that the expression pattern of genes of DD 1 and DD 2 in two ecotypes of Arabidopsis were clearly different. The {{results indicate that the}} putative histone H 2 B and pumilio /Puf RNA-binding protein encoded by DD 1 and DD 2 genes may be involved in regulation of the defence responses against VD-toxins in Arabidopsis and the pumilio/Puf RNA-binding protein plays a more important role in the defence responses.

Verticillium wilt {{is one of the}} vascular disease in plants, which is caused by the <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahlia</b> and leads to yellowing, wilting, lodging, damage to the vascular tissue, and death in cotton plants. Upland cotton varieties KV- 1 have shown resistance to Verticillium wilt in multiple levels. However, the knowledge regarding the post-transcriptional regulation of the resistance is limited. Here two novel small RNA (sRNA) libraries were constructed from the seedlings of upland cotton variety KV- 1, which is highly resistant to Verticillium wilts and inoculated with the V 991 and D 07038 <b>Verticillium</b> <b>dahliae</b> (V. dahliae) of different virulence strains. Thirty-seven novel miRNAs were identified after sequencing these two libraries by the Illumina Solexa system.
