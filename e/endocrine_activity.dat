5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the <b>endocrine</b> <b>activity</b> of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt <b>endocrine</b> <b>activity.</b> Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E

25|$|Endocrine {{insufficiency}} of {{the pancreas}} occurs with JBS, {{though it is}} sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function.

Endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus. Both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with JBS, and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of JBS and its course.|$|E

50|$|The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 {{required}} the United States EPA {{to address the}} issue of endocrine disruption. Since the passage of the FQPA, the US EPA has developed a two-tiered endocrine disruptor screening program (EDSP) designed to examine potential effects of substances on the estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid (EAT) hormone systems in both humans and wildlife. Tier 1 consists of 11 assays, and is designed to determine whether a substance has the potential to interact with the EAT hormone systems. If results indicate a relationship, the chemical progresses to Tier 2 testing. The purpose of Tier 2 is to determine whether a substance that interacts with the EAT hormone system exerts an adverse effect in humans or wildlife, and to develop a dose-response that, in association with exposure data, can be used to assess risk.PBO is one of the chemicals selected by EPA to be part of the initial effort under the EDSP. The EPA issued its first list of chemicals for EDSP testing in 2009, consisting of over 60 pesticide chemicals, including the insecticide synergist PBO. The first list of chemicals for EDSP screening is not based on a potential for <b>endocrine</b> <b>activity</b> or a potential for adverse effects. Rather, the list is based on an EPA prioritization regarding exposure potential. PBO was added to this list because of its wide use pattern (1500 products registered with US EPA), and people may be exposed to low levels of PBO in their diets, from treated surfaces in their homes (e.g., carpet), and in certain occupations (e.g., pest control operators).|$|E

40|$|Vasopressin {{and other}} neurohypophyseal {{peptides}} affect various processes related to memory and/or learning. A single subcutaneous injection of vasopressin increases resistance to extinction of a pole-jumping avoidance response in rat. This test {{system has been}} applied {{in an attempt to}} relate structural aspects of neurohypophyseal peptides, analogues, and derivatives with truncated sequences to their effects on conditioned behavior. Thus far it can be concluded that there are more stringent requirements on certain residues in the 20 -member covalent ring than in positions 8 and 9 of the linear peptide portion for neurohypophyseal hormones to be active. Critical are the contributions of residues in positions 2, 3, and 5; these results are reminiscent of those from conformation-activity correlations of the endocrine effects of neurohypophyseal hormones, in which the side chain of the residue in position 3 is critical for receptor binding and the side chains of residues in positions 2 and 5 are key for the activation of the receptor. Chemical modifications in position 4 yield analogues that are active and inactive in increasing the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response, depending on the particular structural substitution, similar to results from structure-activity studies of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>activities</b> of neurohypophyseal hormones. Because behavioral activities of vasopressin are more tolerant than <b>endocrine</b> <b>activities</b> to modifications of the hormone in positions 8 and 9, analogues with the most striking dissociation of potencies in learned behavior and endocrine responses are expected to be those with sequence alterations in the linear peptide portion.
