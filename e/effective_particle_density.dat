The cigarette smoke was generated using a smoking machine under ISO puffing parameters (35 ml puff of 2 s duration, every 60 s) and {{collected in a}} Tedlar® bag. This smoke generation process resulted in the first puff of the smoking cycle aging approximately 7 min longer than the last puff. The <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> (measured immediately {{upon completion of the}} last puff) was found to be independent of the particle mobility size, indicating the particles have a spherical morphology, with an average density of 1180 ± 113 kg/m 3. Particle coagulation was also found to occur within the Tedlar® bag by comparing particle mobility size distributions, measured with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), against an analytical model. This model showed that particle coagulation dominated the particle number concentration decay within the Tedlar® bag compared to particle diffusion or settling losses. Therefore cigarette smoke particles must have a liquid component to maintain a constant <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> function in the presence of coagulation.

Effective density {{is considered to be a}} key characteristic of airborne nanoparticles due to its role in particle deposition in the human respiratory tract and in the conversion of number distributions to mass distributions. Because effective density cannot be measured directly, in this study the electrical mobility and aerodynamic equivalent diameters of airborne nanoparticles were measured simultaneously (tandem DMA/ELPI). Test aerosols consisted of spherical Di-Ethyl-Hexyl-Sebacate nanoparticles produced by nebulization (PALAS AGK 2000). To take into account the presence of multiply-charged particles at the DMA outlet, a theoretical model was developed in which the successive mechanisms undergone by particles are accounted for.

Because several of the input quantities of the Stokes equation cannot be easily determined for this case of a rotating disc, the disc-CLS approach relies on calibrating the sedimentation time scale with reference particles. To use these calibrant particles for establishing metrological traceability, they must fulfill the same requirements as those imposed on a certified reference material, i. e., their certified Stokes diameter and density value must come with a realistic measurement uncertainty and with a traceability statement. As is the case for several other techniques, the calibrants do not always come with uncertainties for the assigned modal diameter and <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density.</b> The lack of such information and the absence of a traceability statement make it difficult for the end-user to estimate the uncertainty of the measurement results and to compare them with results obtained by others. We present the results of a collaborative study that aimed at demonstrating the traceability of particle size results obtained with disc-CLS. For this purpose, the particle size and <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> of polyvinyl chloride calibrants were measured using different validated methods, and measurement uncertainties were estimated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.

The electromagnet was used to control the contact force between the magnetic particle and the pipe wall by, in effect, varying the <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> from 1000 kgm⁻³ to more than 12, 000 kgm⁻³. This control over the <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> provided a simple and non-intrusive technique of determining {{the critical}} lift force acting on the cubic particle for a broad range of fluid velocities. The cubic particle was chosen to be greater in size than the depth of the von Kármán viscous sub-layer for the range of fluid velocities examined. Critical instantaneous lift forces deduced from the experimental data resulted in an average lift coefficient, CL, of 3 for pipe Reynolds numbers of Re < 20, 000. A wall-corrected drag coefficient, Cᴅᴡ, of Cᴅᴡ = 114 Rep ⁻⁰‧⁸ Cᴅ for 100 < Rep < 1000 was used to calculate the critical lift force, where Rep is the particle Reynolds number and Cᴅ the drag coefficient. The wall-corrected drag coefficient correlation given above was determined in separate experiments in which the horizontal displacement of the cube, after its sudden release from the soffit of the pipe, was recorded.

40|$|A {{series of}} model sterically {{stabilized}} diblock copolymer nanoparticles {{has been designed}} to aid the development of analytical protocols in order to determine two key parameters: the <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> and the steric stabilizer layer thickness. The former parameter is essential for high resolution particle size analysis based on analytical (ultra) centrifugation techniques (e. g., disk centrifuge photosedimentometry, DCP), whereas the latter parameter is of fundamental importance in determining the effectiveness of steric stabilization as a colloid stability mechanism. The diblock copolymer nanoparticles were prepared via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) using RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization: this approach affords relatively narrow particle size distributions and enables the mean particle diameter and the stabilizer layer thickness to be adjusted independently via systematic variation of the mean degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks, respectively. The hydrophobic core-forming block was poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) [PTFEMA], which was selected for its relatively high density. The hydrophilic stabilizer block was poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) [PGMA], which is a well-known non-ionic polymer that remains water-soluble over a wide range of temperatures. Four series of PGMA x -PTFEMA y nanoparticles were prepared (x = 28, 43, 63, and 98, y = 100 - 1400) and characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It was found that the degree of polymerization of both the PGMA stabilizer and core-forming PTFEMA had a strong influence on the mean particle diameter, which ranged from 20 to 250 nm. Furthermore, SAXS was used to determine radii of gyration of 1. 46 to 2. 69 nm for the solvated PGMA stabilizer blocks. Thus, the mean effective density of these sterically stabilized particles was calculated and determined to lie between 1. 19 g cm(- 3) for the smaller particles and 1. 41 g cm(- 3) for the larger particles; these values are significantly lower than the solid-state density of PTFEMA (1. 47 g cm(- 3)). Since analytical centrifugation requires the density difference between the particles and the aqueous phase, determining the <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> is clearly vital for obtaining reliable particle size distributions.

The mass-mobility exponent of the particulate matter from the CFM 56 - 5 B 4 / 2 P engine ranged from 2. 68 to 2. 82, whereas the effective particle densities varied from 600 to 1250 [*][*]kg/m 3, depending on the static engine thrust and sampling methodology used. The effective particle densities from the CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3 and PW 4000 - 100 engines also fell within this range.

Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) alcoholic dispersion polymerization was used to synthesize sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles. The steric stabilizer block was poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMA) and the core-forming block was poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA). The mean degrees of polymerization for the PDMA and PBzMA blocks were 71 and 100, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies confirmed a near-monodisperse spherical morphology, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies indicated an intensity-average diameter of 30 nm. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reported a volume-average diameter of 29 ± 0. 5 nm and a mean aggregation number of 154. Aqueous electrophoresis measurements confirmed that these PDMA 71 -PBzMA 100 nanoparticles acquired cationic character when transferred from ethanol to water as a result of protonation of the weakly basic PDMA chains. Electrostatic adsorption of these nanoparticles from aqueous solution onto 470 nm silica particles led to either flocculation at submonolayer coverage or steric stabilization at or above monolayer coverage, as judged by DLS. This technique indicated that saturation coverage was achieved on addition of approximately 465 copolymer nanoparticles per silica particle, which corresponds to a fractional surface coverage of around 0. 42. These adsorption data were corroborated using thermogravimetry, UV spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

40|$|For {{nanoparticles}} with nonspherical morphologies, e. g., open agglomerates or fibrous particles, it {{is expected}} that the actual density of agglomerates may be significantly different from the bulk material density. It is further expected that using the material density may upset the relationship between surface area and mass when a method for estimating aerosol surface area from number and mass concentrations (referred to as "Maynard's estimation method") is used. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively investigate how much the Maynard's estimation method depends on particle morphology and density. In this study, aerosol surface area estimated from number and mass concentration measurements was evaluated and compared with values from two reference methods: a method proposed by Lall and Friedlander for agglomerates and a mobility based method for compact nonspherical particles using well-defined polydisperse aerosols with known particle densities. Polydisperse silver aerosol particles were generated by an aerosol generation facility. Generated aerosols had a range of morphologies, count median diameters (CMD) between 25 and 50 nm, and geometric standard deviations (GSD) between 1. 5 and 1. 8. The surface area estimates from number and mass concentration measurements correlated well with the two reference values when gravimetric mass was used. The aerosol surface area estimates from the Maynard's estimation method were comparable to the reference method for all particle morphologies within the surface area ratios of 3. 31 and 0. 19 for assumed GSDs 1. 5 and 1. 8, respectively, when the bulk material density of silver was used.

While the widely introduced diesel particle filter technology (DPF) reduces exhaust PM very effectively, resuspension of particles will become increasingly important in the future. In order to allow the time- and size resolved quantification of PM-emissions when sampling at elevated pressures and temperatures an advanced measurement technique was derived and characterized. For that purpose an ejector-diluter based sampling method has been developed. It achieved accuracies of the predicted dilution factor better than ± 8 % (95 % confidence interval) for sample pressures {{in the range of}} 1000 – 4000 mbar and temperatures between 20 – 200 °C. Furthermore, 4 real-time PM mass or number instruments (EEPS 3090, DMS 500, DMM 230, AVL 483) have been evaluated in terms of their usability for vehicle exhaust measurements. As a result correlations between those instruments and the standard methods (SMPS, CPC, gravimetric filter sampling) were determined, and found to be reasonable. The <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> needed for converting the measured particle size spectra into PM-masses was determined to be r eff (D p) ≈ 1 g/cm³. The developed method was exemplarily applied for the determination of the DPF filtration efficiency of a modern diesel vehicle. During the transient NEDC driving cycle the average DPF efficiency was 99. 5 % with respect to PM-mass and 99. 3 % for PM-number. The resulting low-level PM emissions were measured both on a test track and at a chassis dynamometer. Over a wide range of engine operating conditions size resolved emissions factors were consistently about 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to a vehicle without a DPF. During DPF regeneration numbers of nucleation particles increased by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude while the number of soot particles remained about the same. The formation of these particles was suggested to be linked to the amount of sulphate accumulated within the DPF. Additionally, basic evaluations of resuspension and brake wear have been performed. The results showed an exponential relationship between the number-concentration of the resuspended particles and the vehicle speed. Furthermore, the road type was found to play an mportant role. The observed number weighted size distributions of the resuspended particles as well as for brake wear showed count median diameters between 1 - 3 µm. These findings were compared to data obtained from a literature survey, and were found to be in good agreement...|$|E

The inter-connected high <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> regions are identified, showing tube-like structures. The energy decay rates as functions of the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> and the restitution coefficient are obtained. It is found that the probability density function of the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> obeys an exponential distribution at late stages.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of the nano-sized SiO 2 particles on substrates (nitride and silicon) is investigated {{and the surface}} <b>density</b> of deposited <b>particles</b> {{is found to be}} proportional to the volume particle concentration in the contamination solution. The <b>particle</b> surface <b>density</b> is estimated based on this proportionality. When the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> on the surface is very big, the light point defect (LPD) signal measured by light scattering instruments does not increase with the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> deposited. On the contrary, the haze increases proportionally to the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> deposited on the surface. A model is developed to describe the added haze {{as a function of the}} particle size, the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> on the surface and the refractive index of the particle material. This allows to determine the <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> for sizes smaller than the LPD size limit of the current state-of-the-art light scattering instruments. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Clay <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> (g/cm 3) is {{the mass}} of clay solids (oven dry) per unit volume of clay. Clay <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> depends on the densities of the various {{constituent}} solid and their relative abundance. The range is fairly narrow because common soil minerals but differ little in density. An average value of 2.65  g/cm 3 is often assumed. In contrast, organic soils mineral have lower <b>particle</b> <b>densities</b> since the density of organic matter is much {{less than that of}} mineral particle. From Table  1, the <b>particle</b> <b>densities</b> of the clay types are 2.50, 2.55, 2.67, 2.92, 2.16 and 2.43  g/cm 3 for UBC, UKC, 2 -ABC, 2 -AKC, 2 -BBC and 2 -BKC, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model for the {{evolution}} of wealth in a non-conservative economic environment, extending a theory developed earlier by the authors. The model considers a system of rational agents interacting in a game theoretical framework. This evolution drives the dynamic of the agents in both wealth and economic configuration variables. The cost function is chosen to represent a risk averse strategy of each agent. That is, the agent is more likely to interact with the market, the more predictable the market, and therefore the smaller its individual risk. This yields a kinetic equation for an <b>effective</b> single <b>particle</b> agent <b>density</b> with a Nash equilibrium serving as the local thermodynamic equilibrium. We consider a regime of scale separation where the large scale dynamics is given by a hydrodynamic closure with this local equilibrium. A class of generalized collision invariants (GCIs) is developed to overcome the difficulty of the non-conservative property in the hydrodynamic closure derivation of the large scale dynamics for the evolution of wealth distribution. The result is a system of gas dynamics-type equations for the density and average wealth of the agents on large scales. We recover the inverse Gamma distribution, which has been previously considered in the literature, as a local equilibrium for particular choices of the cost function...|$|R
40|$|The Nanoparticle Field Extraction Thruster (NanoFET) is a micropropulsion {{technology}} that electrostatically charges and accelerates micro- and nano-particles to generate thrust. Designed in a flat-panel configuration for scalability to different spacecraft power levels, NanoFET is anticipated {{to provide a}} large propulsive envelope capable of accomplishing a range of missions not currently possible with a single propulsion system. In addition, NanoFET also has potential applications as a generalized nano-particle accelerator for terrestrial uses {{in the fields of}} materials processing, environmental remediation, and biomedicine. 	Three key challenges facing NanoFET’s development are: 1. 	How can specific charge be controlled to meet propulsive performance targets with reasonable operating potentials? 2. 	How can inter-particle cohesive and particle-electrode adhesive forces be overcome to permit charged particle extraction? 3. 	How can technical and integration risk be mitigated to advance NanoFET’s technology readiness level? 	 2 -D, axisymmetric, finite-element simulations were conducted of particles undergoing electrostatic charging in diode configurations. Maximum charging was obtained for extractor gate aspect ratios (i. e., gate orifice diameter to diode separation) less than unity and for emitter-to-emitter spacings greater than five particle diameters. Thin-shell particles are proposed as an attractive means of maximizing specific charge by reducing the <b>effective</b> <b>particle</b> mass <b>density.</b> 	Piezoelectrics were considered as an efficient means of applying inertial forces to aid with overcoming cohesive and adhesive forces, which are also mitigated by nanometer-scale surface coatings that increase the effective surface-to-surface separation. The piezoelectrics in NanoFET’s feed system are expected to set the characteristic time scale of thruster operations and provide for throttleable mass flow rates and precise impulse bits. Together with throttling the operating voltage, NanoFET is a variable specific impulse thruster (e. g., 100 - 900 s) with expectations of high thrust-to-power (e. g., > 1 mN/W) and thrust densities (e. g., ~ 1 mN/cm 2) when used at modest specific impulses. 	Prototype micro-particle extractors {{are in the process of}} being tested for both dry and liquid-suspended propellants, the latter for terrestrial applications. Modeling and experimental results are promising and recommend NanoFET for continued development...|$|R

40|$|Combined {{mobility}} and aerodynamic measurements {{were used to}} characterize the morphology of soot particles in an experimental campaign on the hygroscopic growth and activation of an artificial biomass burning aerosol. A custom-made, single-stage low-pressure impactor and two aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS) operating in the free molecular regime were {{used to measure the}} vacuum aerodynamic diameter of mobility-selected artificial soot particles that were produced in a spark discharge generator and then modified by condensation of ammonium hydrogen sulfate or levoglucosan as a coating to change their hydroscopic activity. Transmission electron microscope images revealed a relationship between the electrical mobility diameter and the diameter of the enveloping sphere, thus enabling evaluation of the effective density of soot agglomerates. A fractal description of the morphology of the soot aggregates allowed for evaluation of the average mass of the hygroscopic material per particle. The average mass of the hygroscopic material per particle was also measured directly with the two AMS instruments, and the agreement between the two methods was found satisfactory. This tandem approach allows detection of small changes in the <b>particle</b> <b>effective</b> <b>density</b> and morphology caused by condensation of organic material...|$|R

To obtain <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> distributions in tephra fall deposits, we performed high-resolution componentry and <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> analyses on samples from the 2006 subplinian eruption of Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador. Six componentry classes, including pumice and scoria, {{have been identified in}} our sample collection. We determined the class of 300 clasts in each 0. 5 ϕ fractions from − 4. 5 ϕ to 3. 5 ϕ and carried out water pycnometry density measurements on selected size fractions. Results indicate that the mean <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> increases with ϕ up to a plateau of ~ 2. 6 g/cm 3 for clasts finer than 1. 5 ϕ. The density of scoria and pumice increases between − 3 and 1 ϕ, while dense <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> is sub-constant with grainsize. We show that the mean <b>particle</b> <b>density</b> μ of the vesicular fractions is a function of grainsize i (ϕ scale) given by a sigmoidal law: μ(i) =K+β/(1 +αe −ri), where K, β, α and r are constants.
