50|$|Bandage scissors, or bandage forceps, are angled tip scissors, with a blunt tip on {{the bottom}} blade, which helps in cutting {{bandages}} without gouging the skin.Bandage scissors were invented by Henry A. Kimmel in 1961 to prevent injury when removing a tight bandage. They are very popular in any health care facility because {{they are designed to}} safely lift bandages away from skin for <b>easy</b> <b>cutting.</b> The bottom blade of the scissor is longer and goes easily under the bandages. The blunt tip design of the scissor prevents accidental injury while making bandage removal very easy, smooth, and quick.|$|E

These knives are also much thinner. While the deba bocho is a heavy blade for <b>easy</b> <b>cutting</b> through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice.

50|$|Cutting is a {{compressive}} and shearing phenomenon, and occurs {{only when}} the total stress generated by the cutting implement exceeds the ultimate strength of the material of the object being cut. The simplest applicable equation is stress = force/area: The stress generated by a cutting implement is directly proportional to the force with which it is applied, and inversely proportional {{to the area of}} contact. Hence, the smaller the area (i.e., the sharper the cutting implement), the less force is needed to cut something. It is generally seen that cutting edges are thinner for cutting soft materials and thicker for harder materials. This progression is seen from kitchen knife, to cleaver, to axe, and is a balance between the <b>easy</b> <b>cutting</b> action of a thin blade vs strength and edge durability of a thicker blade.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutting the cervix, morcellation, and {{extraction}} {{of the uterus}} and myomata remain major problems in endoscopic surgery. We developed an efficient, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument to cut the cervix and morcellate the uterus and myomata: the morcellator knife. INSTRUMENT: The morcellator knife is a classic lancet with an interchangeable blade, transformed into an endoscopic instrument that can be inserted easily through a 10 -mm-diameter trocar. The blade has an automatic retraction system and {{is set in the}} standby position, ensuring security. Cutting the cervix and uterine or myoma fragmentation are easy. The mass to be cut is held between two grasping forceps for <b>easy</b> <b>cutting</b> with the blade, under permanent visual control. After morcellation, {{extraction of}} the masses is performed through a posterior culdotomy. EXPERIENCE: We have used this morcellator knife in 54 subtotal hysterectomies and 16 myomectomies. There were no complications during the procedures. Morcellation lasted 3 - 14 minutes and involved the use of an average of two to three blades. CONCLUSION: The morcellator knife is a simple, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument with a low maintenance cost...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCutting tools with ceramic inserts are {{increasingly}} being used in machining of super alloys typically used in aerospace industry. The ceramic inserts make higher cutting speeds possible due to the higher temperature resistance compared to carbide inserts. However, {{the success of the}} process is very sensitive to the right selection of process parameters. In this study, analytical process models for indexable milling tools with round ceramic inserts are presented. These models can be used to determine the cutting parameters for optimum quality and maximum productivity. Firstly, geometry of the insert cutting edges under the effect of angles on the inserts was formulated. Then, an analytical cutting force model was developed. This allows analyzing the effects of the parameters on the cutting forces. A time-domain model was also developed to analyze the dynamic cutting forces and stability limits for the milling process. Afterwards, the models were implemented in a Matlab® GUI to make the applications of the models in the industry <b>easy.</b> <b>Cutting</b> force coefficients, which are needed to calculate cutting forces, were identified from cutting tests with Inconel 718 material. Then, the cutting force model was validated with cutting experiments. After obtaining modal data of the tool via tap testing, dynamic cutting forces and vibrations were simulated by means of the time domain model. A series of simulations was carried out to determine stability limits at certain operating conditions using the time domain model, and stability lobes for the tools under study were plotted...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrently {{technologies}} {{which are}} applied for leather cutting include slitting knifes, die press techniques and manual cutting. Use of laser technology has grown significantly during recent years due to number of advantages over conventional cutting methods; flexibility, high production speed, possibility to cut complex geometries, <b>easier</b> <b>cutting</b> of customized parts, and less leftovers of leather makes laser cutting {{more and more}} economically attractive to apply for leather cutting. Laser technology provides advantages in cutting complex geometries, stable cutting quality and possibility to utilize leather material in economically best way. Constant quality is important in industrial processes and laser technology fulfills this requirement: properly chosen laser cutting parameters provides identical cuts. Additionally, laser technology is very flexible in terms of geometries: complex geometries, individual designs, prototypes and small scale products can be manufactured by laser cutting. Variety of products, which needed to be cut in small volumes, is also the application where laser cutting can be more beneficial due to possibility to change production from one product to another only by changing geometry without a need to change cutting tool. Disadvantages of laser processing include high initial investment costs and some running costs due to maintenance and required gas supply for the laser. Higher level of operator's expertise is required due to more complicated machinery in case of laser cutting. This study investigates {{advantages and disadvantages of}} laser cutting in different areas of application and provides comparison between laser cutting and mechanical cutting of leather...|$|R
