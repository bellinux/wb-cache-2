40|$|In {{the field}} of {{conventional}} cleaner power generation technology, concentrating solar power systems have introduced remarkable opportunity. In a solar power tower, solar energy concentrated by the heliostats at a single point produces very high temperature. Falling solid particles or heat transfer fluid passing through that high temperature region absorbs heat to generate electricity. Increasing the residence time will result in more heat gain and increase efficiency. A novel design of solar receiver for both fluid and solid particle is approached in this paper which can increase residence time resulting in higher temperature gain in one cycle compared to conventional receivers. The <b>helical</b> <b>tubular</b> solar receiver placed at the focused sunlight region meets the higher outlet temperature and efficiency. A vertical tubular receiver is modeled and analyzed for single phase flow with molten salt as heat transfer fluid and alloy 625 as heat transfer material. The result is compared to a journal paper of similar numerical and experimental setup for validating our modeling. New types of <b>helical</b> <b>tubular</b> solar receivers are modeled and analyzed with heat transfer fluid turbulent flow in single phase, and granular particle and air plug flow in multiphase to observe the temperature rise in one cyclic operation. The Discrete Ordinate radiation model is used for numerical analysis with simulation software Ansys Fluent 15. 0. The Eulerian granular multiphase model is used for multiphase flow. Applying the same modeling parameters and boundary conditions, the results of vertical and helical receivers are compared. With a helical receiver, higher temperature gain of heat transfer fluid is achieved in one cycle for both single phase and multiphase flow compared to the vertical receiver. Performance is also observed by varying dimension of helical receiver. ...|$|E

We report complementary time-lapse microscopic studies {{of cholesterol}} crystallization from model bile that reveal initial assembly of filamentous cholesterol crystals covered by a monomolecular layer of lecithin. Over a few days, the filaments evolved through needle, <b>helical,</b> and <b>tubular</b> microstructures to form classical platelike cholesterol monohydrate crystals. Similar crystallization phenomena were observed in human gallbladder biles from cholesterol but not pigment stone patients. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction of the earliest filaments suggested a cholesterol monohydrate polymorph or admixture with an anhydrous cholesterol precursor. However, density gradient centrifugation of filamentous crystals revealed that their density was 1. 032 g/ml, consistent with anhydrous cholesterol. Conventional x-ray diffraction of transitional crystalline forms was consistent with pure cholesterol monohydrate crystals, as were the equilibrium platelike crystals. These novel findings suggest that crystalline cholesterol in bile may not be completely mature or hydrated initially, but undergoes a series of transformations to become thermodynamically stable monohydrate plates.

New buckling load equations are derived to properly predict <b>tubular</b> sinusoidal and <b>helical</b> buckling in such wellbores. The results show that the buckling loads to initiate sinusoidal and <b>helical</b> buckling of <b>tubulars</b> in curved wellbores are usually much larger than those in straight wellbores. This is because the curved wellbore tends to hold the axially compressed tubular against the outer-curve side of the wellbore. The tubular becomes less easy to buckle until higher axial compres-sive loads are applied. Less tubular lockup risk is then predicted for tubulars in horizontal or extended-reach wells by using the new buckling load equations. The new buckling loads in curved wellbores agree with those in straight wellbores when wellbore curvature approaches zero. Small-scale laboratory experiments also con-firmed these theoretically derived buckling loads...|$|R

Using X-ray patterns analysis (see Fig. 1 a) combined with molecular modelling methods, the 2, 3 -exodisyndiotactic stereochemistry por this polymer has been established, with stereoregular chains adopting an unusual <b>tubular</b> <b>helical</b> conformation in the crystalline state [1]. The helices’ packing leaves empty accessible channels, in which guest molecules can be hosted (see {{the case of}} toluene in Fig. 1 b).

Molecular modelling, including molecular mechanics and dynamics and quantum mechanics calculations specific for solid state phases may help to evaluate relative stabilities of of different host/guest crystals.

Although flagellar sheath has been reported for almost 60 years, {{little is known about}} its function and the mechanism of its assembly. Recently, we have observed a novel type of sheath that encloses a flagellar bundle, instead of a single flagellum, in a marine magnetotactic bacterium MO- 1. Here, we reported isolation and characterization of the sheath which can be described as a six-start, right-handed <b>helical</b> <b>tubular</b> structure with a diameter of about 100 nm, and a pitch of helix of about 260 nm. By proteomic, microscopic and immuno-labelling analyses, we showed that the sheath of MO- 1 consists of glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass > 350 kDa. This protein, named sheath associated protein (Sap), shows homology with bacterial adhesins and eukaryotic calcium-dependent adherent proteins (cadherin). Most importantly, we showed that calcium ions mediate the assembly of the tubular-shaped sheath and disintegration of the sheath was deleterious for smooth-swimming of MO- 1 cells. The disintegrated sheath was efficiently reconstituted in vitro by adding calcium ions. Altogether, these results demonstrate a novel bacterial Ca 2 +-dependent surface architecture, which is essential for bacterial swimming...|$|E

As a prelude to exploring the potential of HARMs formed from lipopeptides in controlled release drug delivery, several microstructure formation conditions were investigated. We report the preparation of several glutamic acid dialkyl amides with varying alkyl chain lengths bearing a variety of peptides (1 – 4 amino acids) [peptide-Glu-(NHCnH 2 n+ 1) 2, n= 12, 14, 16].

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{of magnesium}} alloy chips {{is a problem}} during high speed dry machining in industry. It should be avoided in the practical production. Many factors including machining environment, material composition, tool geometry, cutting parameters etc. can influence the cutting processes. Among these factors, cutting parameters is one of most important elements to induce the ignition of magnesium alloys. AM 50 A is a commercial magnesium alloy which is widely used in industry. However, very few reports about the ignition conditions of AM 50 A magnesium alloy are available. In this paper, we investigated the ignition conditions of AM 50 A magnesium alloy at different cutting parameters. The relationship between ignition conditions and chip morphologies was further explored. The macro morphologies of the chips were observed by optical microscope and the micro structure were obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is found that the macro morphologies of chips can be characterized into powdered chip, <b>tubular</b> <b>helical</b> chip, acicular helical chip, and long belt chip, which correspond to the different ignition conditions.

The culture systems currently used to grow these algae are generally fairly unsophisticated. For example, Dunaliella salina is cultured in large (up to approx. 250 ha) shallow open-air ponds with no artificial mixing. Similarly, Chlorella and Spirulina also are grown outdoors in either paddle-wheel mixed ponds or circular ponds with a rotating mixing arm of up to about 1 ha in area per pond. The production of microalgae for aquaculture is generally on a much smaller scale, {{and in many cases}} is carried out indoors in 20 - 40 1 carboys or in large plastic bags of up to approximately 1000 1 in volume. More recently, a <b>helical</b> <b>tubular</b> photobioreactor system, the BIOCOIL™, has been developed which allows these algae to be grown reliably outdoors at high cell densities in semi-continuous culture. Other closed photobioreactors such as fiat panels are also being developed. The main problem facing the commercialisation of new microalgae and microalgal products is the need for closed culture systems and the fact that these are very capital intensive. The high cost of microalgal culture systems relates to the need for light and the relatively slow growth rate of the algae.

The study aims to explore the hydride generation technique which is normally coupled with efficient thermal source to apply determination of heavy metals in water samples via spectrometric analysis. The arsenic hydride generation process and the atomization of the generated hydride in a quartz cell atomizer were studied analytically as model case studies. The hydride generation (HG) process was analyzed by adopting two hypotheses, the nascent hydrogen and formation of intermediate hydroboron species, where the results based on the second hypothesis are found to be more realistic for design purposes. Moreover, the release of the gener-ated hydride from the liquid phase and their transport to the gas phase is simulated in a <b>helical</b> <b>tubular</b> section, in which the actual tubular section length required for separation is deduced.

Two Biocoils, (airlift and submersible centrifugal pump driven) were tested. Despite several attempts in using airlift-driven Biocoil (e. g. modification of the sparger design), no net microalgae growth was observed due to intense foaming and loss of culture. Initial ammonium nitrogen concentration in the Biocoil and pond was 893. 03 ± 17. 0 mg NH 4 +-N L- 1. Overall, similar average ammonium nitrogen removal rate in Biocoil (24. 6 ± 7. 18 mg NH 4 +-N L- 1 day- 1) and raceway pond (25. 9 ± 8. 6 mg NH 4 +-N L- 1 day- 1) was achieved. The average volumetric biomass productivity of microalgae grown in the Biocoil (25. 03 ± 0. 24 mg AFDW L- 1 day- 1) was 2. 1 times higher than in raceway pond.

This machinery is used during multivesicular endosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, and budding of some enveloped viruses. Membrane fission is catalyzed by ESCRT-III complexes made of polymers of charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs) and by the AAA-type ATPase VPS 4. How and which of the ESCRT-III subunits sustain membrane fission from the cytoplasmic surface remain uncertain. In vitro, CHMP 2 and CHMP 3 recombinant proteins polymerize into <b>tubular</b> <b>helical</b> structures, which were hypothesized to drive vesicle fission. However, this model awaits the demonstration that such structures exist and can deform membranes in cellulo. Here, we show that depletion of VPS 4 induces specific accumulation of endogenous CHMP 2 B at the plasma membrane. Unlike other CHMPs, overexpressed full-length CHMP 2 B polymerizes into long, rigid tubes that protrude out of the cell. CHMP 4 s relocalize {{at the base of}} the tubes, the formation of which depends on VPS 4. Cryo-EM of the CHMP 2 B membrane tubes demonstrates that CHMP 2 B polymerizes into a tightly packed helical lattice, in close association with the inner leaflet of the membrane tube. This association is tight enough to deform the lipid bilayer in cases where the tubular CHMP 2 B helix varies in diameter or is closed by domes.

To isolate the radioactivity to minimize radiation doses to personnel, and protect the primary circuit from contamination, intermediate heat exchangers (IHXs) have been proposed as a means for separating the primary circuit of the NGNP (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) or other process heat application from the remainder of the plant. This task will first review the different concepts of IHX that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications in a range of temperature from 850 to 950 C. This will cover shell-and-tube and compact designs (including the platefin concept). The review will then discuss the maturity of the concepts in terms of design, fabricability and component testing (or feedback from experience when applicable). Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of developing the IHX concepts for the NGNP with operation expected in 2018 - 2021. This report will also discuss material candidates for IHX applications and will discuss specific issues {{that will have to be}} addressed in the context of the HTR design (thermal aging, corrosion, creep, creep-fatigue, etc). Particular attention will be paid to specific issues associated with operation at the upper end of the creep regime...|$|R
40|$|Self-propelling microobjects or colloids are {{a topical}} {{research}} subject for soft matter microrobots {{as well as}} for devices that mix, sort and circulate fluids. However, an artificial microswimmer that propels itself by pure body deformation is rather difficult to realize, since the deformations have to be non-reciprocal (or time-irreversible) during cyclic actuations, which is also known as the Scallop Theorem proposed by E. M. Purcell. Additional requirements to implement such a morphing microswimmer are a source of energy, sufficiently fast actuation, and a control mechanism for the repetition {{as well as for}} directing the motion. In this dissertation, a novel class of artificial microswimmers is presented that exploit the principle of out-of-equilibrium actuation by photothermal heating. The system consists of a crosslinked thermoresponsive hydrogel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) laden with gold nanorods. Very fast temperature jumps localized to the volume of the microgel can be achieved by laser irradiation of the gold nanorods, which convert light energy into heat with efficiency close to unity. Because the diffusion of the gel network cannot follow fast temperature changes in time, the volume change can be effectuated out of equilibrium. Under out-of-equilibrium conditions, non-reciprocal motions are expected to take place due to the deviation in the swelling and shrinking path. The control over temperature change and rate inside a hydrogel network by photothermal heating is demonstrated, and the heating processes were shown to be distinct from the case of gold nanorods suspended in solution. Ultrasmall hydrogel objects were prepared by the PRINT (Particle Replication in Non-wetting Templates) technique, known to be effective in controlling the composition, size and geometry in the microscopic range. The actuation kinetics by photothermal heating was investigated based on a disk-shaped microgel under stroboscopic irradiations, and the actuation efficiency was estimated. Anisometric microgels have also been prepared, which demonstrated bending deformation and enhanced actuation amplitude due to the out-of-equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, bilayer hydrogel ribbons were fabricated that underwent reversible shape transformations upon swelling/shrinking. Spiral, <b>helical</b> or <b>tubular</b> geometries can be achieved depending on the initial aspect ratios of the ribbon. The helical microgels showed a response time on the millisecond scale upon photothermal actuation. The switch of the helicity can be triggered by irradiations due to the inversion of the ribbon curvature. The inversion process was found to be highly dependent on the environmental temperature and ionic species in the medium, which can be potentially utilized in sensing applications. By fine tuning of the irradiation conditions, rotational motion was achieved on both helical and spiral microgels. Analysis of the kinematics revealed non-reciprocal deformation paths under stroboscopic irradiations. When exposed to physical confinements, the helical microgels also exhibited translational motions. The results in this dissertation point out the possibility to design the modes, sequences, and amplitudes of complex body deformations of small hydrogel objects in a precise and purposeful way. The self-propulsion of microgels by dynamic control of shapes through photothermal heating provides an exciting avenue for developing soft micro-robotics in biomedical or microfluidic applications...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{sterilization}} Hollow Load Process Challenge Devices (HLPCDs) {{are designed}} to assess the adequacy of air removal and steam penetration in a porous load steam sterilization process including those used in {{both large and small}} sterilizers. A PCD should be used in every load to ensure adequacy of air removal and steam penetration. Use of PCDs is also {{an integral part of the}} quality assurance systems used to ensure the sterility of each batch of reusable medical devices. There are a number of HLPCDs commercially available which have various design features ranging from simple <b>tubular</b> <b>helical</b> designs compliant to EN 867 - 5 to more complex electronic measurement systems. The aim of this study was to assess seven commercially produced HLPCDs for their ability to detect residual air in a porous load steam sterilizer employing a range of air removal stages. In addition to testing in processes deemed to be satisfactory, assessment was also carried out in cycles in which increasing amounts of residual air was artificially induced. The performance of each HLPCD was compared to that of a Bowie and Dick (BD) textile test pack into which were inserted temperature sensors. All tests were carried out with a single device in an empty chamber. The BD textile pack was chosen as a reference because it is well established as reference device for both full load and empty chamber tests. Only one of the seven HLPCDs tested exhibited equivalent performance to the BD reference device. One HLPCD was overly sensitive, failing an acceptable process. Four HLPCDs were incapable of detecting large failures in sub/super atmospheric pulsing cycles. One HLPCD was insensitive to residual air introduced into the chamber as a bolus at a specific point in the cycle. The results of this study show an unacceptable variability in performance in HLPCDs claimed to meet EN 867 - 5. Users should be extremely cautious when selecting an appropriate PCD for use in their own Sterile Service Departments and where possible, evaluation should be carried out before selections are made. Some HLPCDs will lead to a false sense of security and may result in processed goods being released into use, the sterility of which may be compromised due to undetected process failures...|$|R
40|$|Two {{key issues}} defined {{the focus of}} this {{research}} in manufacturing plasmid DNA for use In human gene therapy. First, the processing of E. coli bacterial cells to effect the separation of therapeutic plasmid DNA from cellular debris and adventitious material. Second, the affinity purification of the plasmid DNA in a Simple one-stage process. The need arises when considering the concerns that have been recently voiced by the FDA concerning the scalability and reproducibility of the current manufacturing processes in meeting the quality criteria of purity, potency, efficacy, and safety for a recombinant drug substance for use in humans. To develop a preliminary purification procedure, an EFD cross-flow micro-filtration module was assessed for its ability to effect the 20 -fold concentration, 6 -time diafiltration, and final clarification of the plasmid DNA from the subsequent cell lysate that is derived from a 1 liter E. coli bacterial cell culture. Historically, the employment of cross-flow filtration modules within procedures for harvesting cells from bacterial cultures have failed to reach the required standards dictated by existing continuous centrifuge technologies, frequently resulting in the rapid blinding of the membrane with bacterial cells that substantially reduces the permeate flux. By challenging the EFD module, containing six <b>helical</b> wound <b>tubular</b> membranes promoting centrifugal instabilities known as Dean vortices, with distilled water between the Dean number's of 187 Dn and 818 Dn,and the transmembrane pressures (TMP) of 0 to 5 psi. The data demonstrated that the fluid dynamics significantly influenced the permeation rate, displaying a maximum at 227 Dn (312 Imh) and minimum at 818 Dn (130 Imh) for a transmembrane pressure of 1 psi. Numerical studies indicated that the initial increase and subsequent decrease resulted from a competition between the centrifugal and viscous forces that create the Dean vortices. At Dean numbers between 187 Dn and 227 Dn, the forces combine constructively to increase the apparent strength and influence of the Dean vortices. However, as the Dean number in increases above 227 On the centrifugal force dominates the viscous forces, compressing the Dean vortices into the membrane walls and reducing their influence on the radial transmembrane pressure i. e. the permeate flux reduced. When investigating the action of the Dean vortices in controlling tile fouling rate of E. coli bacterial cells, it was demonstrated that the optimum cross-flow rate at which to effect the concentration of a bacterial cell culture was 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP, processing in excess of 400 Imh for 20 minutes (i. e., concentrating a 1 L culture to 50 ml in 10 minutes at an average of 450 Imh). The data demonstrated that there was a conflict between the Dean number at which the shear rate could control the cell fouling, and the Dean number at which tile optimum flux enhancement was found. Hence, the internal geometry of the EFD module was shown to sub-optimal for this application. At 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP, the 6 -fold diafiltration was shown to occupy 3. 6 minutes of process time, processing at an average flux of 400 Imh. Again, at 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP the clarification of the plasmid from tile resulting freeze-thaw cell lysate was achieved at 120 Iml 1, passing 83 % (2, 5 mg) of the plasmid DNA (6, 3 ng μ- 1 10. 8 mg of genomic DNA (∼ 23, 00 Obp, 36 ng μ- 1), and 7. 2 mg of cellular proteins (5 - 100 kDa, 21. 4 ngμ- 1) into the post-EFD process stream. Hence the EFD module was shown to be effective, achieving the desired objectives in approximately 25 minutes. On the basis of its ability to intercalate into low molecular weight dsDNA present in dilute cell lysates, and be electrophoresed through agarose, the fluorophore PicoGreen was selected {{for the development of a}} suitable dsDNA assay. It was assesseel for its accuracy, and reliability, In determining the concentration and identity of DNA present in samples that were eleclrophoresed through agarose gels. The signal emitted by intercalated PicoGreen was shown to be constant and linear, and that the mobility of the PicaGreen-DNA complex was not affected by the intercalation. Concerning the secondary purification procedure, various anion-exchange membranes were assessed for their ability to capture plasmid DNA from the post-EFD process stream. For a commercially available Sartorius Sartobind Q 15 membrane, the reduction in the equilibriumbinding capacity for  ctDNA in buffer of increasing ionic demonstrated that DNA was being. adsorbed by electrostatic  interactions only. However, the problems associated with fluid distribution across the membrane demonstrated that the membrane housing was the predominant cause of the. erratic breakthrough curves. Consequently, this would need to be rectified before such a membrane could be integrated into the current system, or indeed be scaled beyond laboratory scale. However, when challenged with the process material, the data showed that considerable quantities of protein (1150 μg) were adsorbed preferentially to the plasmid DNA (44 μg). This was also shown for derived Pall Gelman UltraBind US 450 membranes that had been functionalised by varying molecular weight poly-L~lysine and polyethyleneimine ligands. Hence the anion-exchange membranes were shown to be ineffective in capturing plasmid DNA from the process stream. Finally, work was performed to integrate a sequence-specific DNA·binding protein into a single-stage DNA chromatography, isolating plasmid DNA from E. coli cells whilst minimising the contamination from genomic DNA and cellular protein. Preliminary work demonstrated that the fusion protein was capable of isolating pUC 19 DNA into which the recognition sequence for the fusion-protein had been inserted (pTS DNA) when in the presence of the conditioned process material. Althougth the pTS recognition sequence differs from native pUC 19 sequences by only 2 bp, the fusion protein was shown to act as a highly selective affinity ligand for pTS DNA alone. Subsequently, the scale of the process was scaled 25 -fold and positioned directly following the EFD system. In conclusion, the integration of the EFD micro-filtration system and zinc-finger affinity purification technique resulted in the capture of approximately 1 mg of plasmid DNA was purified from 1 L of E. coli  culture in a simple two stage process, resulting in the complete removal of genomic DNA and 96. 7 % of cellular protein in less than 1 hour of process time...|$|R
