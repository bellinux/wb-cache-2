5000|$|It is {{essential}} to remember that, for N-MOSFETs, the high-side switch must be driven to a higher voltage than Vi. To achieve this, MOSFET gate drivers typically feed the MOSFET output voltage back into the <b>gate</b> <b>driver.</b> The <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> then adds its own supply voltage to the MOSFET output voltage when driving the high-side MOSFETs to achieve a Vgs equal to the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> supply voltage. [...] Because the low-side Vgs is the <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> supply voltage, this results in very similar Vgs values for high-side and low-side MOSFETs.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{power losses}} {{occur as a}} result of the power {{required}} to turn the switches on and off. For MOSFET switches, these losses are dominated by the gate charge, essentially the energy required to charge and discharge the capacitance of the MOSFET gate between the threshold voltage and the selected gate voltage. These switch transition losses occur primarily in the <b>gate</b> <b>driver,</b> and can be minimized by selecting MOSFETs with low gate charge, by driving the MOSFET gate to a lower voltage (at the cost of increased MOSFET conduction losses), or by operating at a lower frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{switching}} signal for a transistor is usually {{generated by a}} logic circuit or a microcontroller, which provides an output signal that typically {{is limited to a}} few milliamperes of current. Consequently, a transistor which is directly driven by such a signal would switch very slowly, with correspondingly high power loss. During switching, the gate capacitor of the transistor may draw current so quickly that it causes a current overdraw in the logic circuit or microcontroller, causing overheating which leads to permanent damage or even complete destruction of the chip. To prevent this from happening, a <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> is provided between the microcontroller output signal and the power transistor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} way of {{creating}} the PWM signal {{is to use a}} high speed comparator ("C" [...] in the block-diagram above) that compares a high frequency triangular wave with the audio input. This generates a series of pulses of which the duty cycle is directly proportional with the instantaneous value of the audio signal. The comparator then drives a MOS <b>gate</b> <b>driver</b> which in turn drives a pair of high-power switches (usually MOSFETs). This produces an amplified replica of the comparator's PWM signal. The output filter removes the high-frequency switching components of the PWM signal and recovers the audio information that the speaker can use.|$|E
50|$|The most {{efficient}} MOSFET designs use N-channel MOSFETs {{on both the}} high side and low side because they typically have {{a third of the}} ON resistance of P-channel MOSFETs. This requires a more complex design since the gates of the high side MOSFETs must be driven positive with respect to the DC supply rail.

40|$|For area reasons, NMOS {{transistors}} are preferred over PMOS for {{the pull-up}} path in <b>gate</b> <b>drivers.</b> Bootstrapping has to ensure sufficient NMOS gate overdrive.
