25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} oil {{depletion}} by the UK Energy Research Centre {{pointed out that}} there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post-peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.|$|E

2500|$|A lively controversialist, Francis {{began with}} some largely valid {{complaints}} {{about how the}} Southern heritage is demonized in mainstream culture. He went on, however, to attack the liberal principles of humanism and universalism for facilitating [...] "the war against the white race." [...] At one point he described country music megastar Garth Brooks as [...] "repulsive" [...] because [...] "he has that stupid universalist song, in which we all intermarry." [...] His fellow whites, he insisted, must [...] "reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites... The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> {{to believe that the}} civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why {{the state}} should not assist... {{individuals}} in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, {{as in the case}} of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.|$|E

There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it?

Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 insurance fee required by the school for home loaners.

He was very well off certainly at Framley; but he could never hope for anything beyond Framley, if he allowed himself to regard Lady Lufton as a bugbear.

40|$|Local commons {{encompass}} a {{wide range}} of resources whose shared feature is the need for some form of collective management. In what follows, we shall be concerned mainly with the problems of implementing a collective management plan. Whatever the mechanisms invoked, many recent contributions to the literature have stressed that relatively informal collective management of common property resources can in the right circumstances avoid the severe resource degradation predicted by "the tragedy of the commons. " Nevertheless, both empirical and theoretical arguments suggest that cooperative behavior may be only partial, and the incentives of short-term self-interest only partially held in check. Under what circumstances, then, can more formal implementation mechanisms make good the deficiency? And, given that formal incentives are typically stronger than informal ones, <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reasons</b> why informal incentives might nevertheless sometimes be preferred?...|$|R
