Caption: "Two Edmond school {{teachers}} died in this car when it collided head-on with the heavy truck-trailer (shown in background) at NE Memorial Park road and Eastern Wednesday night. Note the heavy Pipe which rammed through side and back window of the car. the pipe, however, missed both victims who were crushed against the dashboard. [...] Two Edmond teachers were killed Wednesday night when the car in which they were riding collided head-on with a <b>heavy</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> truck near NE Memorial Park road and Eastern. The victims were identified by state troopers as: Mrs. Dixie Emma Smith, 38, of two miles southeast of Edmond; Miss Willie Milam, 40, 820 1 / 2 NW 21, Oklahoma City. Driver of the truck, Raymond Cecil Riggs, 45, of 1329 SW 36, escaped serious injury. Troopers said he suffered bruises and minor head cuts. Troopers Lyle Baker and Ray Rich identified the driver of the death car as Mrs. Smith. She is the wife of Lothar Smith, employed by the state fire inspection office and a former Edmond fireman. [...] -Women Pinned in Wreck [...] - Both victims were pinned in the wreckage. Troopers said Mrs. Smith was killed instantly. Miss Milam died en route to Edmond Hospital. Riggs told troopers he was driving 30 miles an hour {{at the time of the}} accident. He said the car, driven by Mrs. Smith, was passing another truck and ran head-on into his truck. Riggs' truck-trailer was loaded with heavy pipe and a fuel tank. One six-inch pipe crashed through the windows of the automobile. Both women taught classes in College Campus school at Central State College and were well known to Edmond residents. ...|$|E

50|$|A {{relay valve}} is an {{air-operated}} valve typically used in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a <b>heavy</b> truck or <b>semi-trailer</b> in a tractor-trailer combination. Relay valves are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, foot-valve, parking-control valve, and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|R
40|$|Multi-combination {{vehicles}} (MCV) are {{road freight}} vehicles with a prime mover towing {{two or more}} trailers. These vehicles are common in regional Australia; however {{there is a growing}} need from the freight industry to allow them to use a larger network of urban roads, where the surrounding passenger car drivers are not typically exposed to their presence. To evaluate the full impacts of MCVs, all issues must be considered from productivity and economic benefit, to infrastructure damage, safety implications, congestion impacts, environmental/amenity effects and psychological effects of other road users. The research aims to compare the behavioural characteristics of vehicles surrounding MCVs and other general access vehicles. Video footage was collected on a two-lane, two-way urban motorway that provides access to the Port of Brisbane, Australia. The route is currently designated a B-Double route. It experiences high traffic volumes with a one-way AADT of approximately 33, 500. The footage was recorded on a level and straight stretch of road, away from any off/on ramps. An overpass was used to position the camera high above the centre of the carriageway. The study showed that passenger car behaviour changes around <b>heavy</b> vehicles (<b>semi-trailers</b> and B-doubles) when compared to passenger cars; however, there is no significant difference in passenger car behaviour around semi-trailers than B-doubles. Just less than 95...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study dealing with the risk for heavy vehicles in ramps. Two approaches are used. On one hand, statistics are applied on several accidents databases to detect if ramps are more risky for heavy vehicles and to define a critical value for longitudinal slope. test confirmed the risk in ramps and statistical analysis proved that a longitudinal slope superior to 3. 2 % represents a higher risk for heavy vehicles. On another hand, numerical simulations allow defining the speed profile in ramps for two types of <b>heavy</b> vehicles (tractor <b>semi-trailer</b> and 2 -axles rigid body) and different loads. The simulations showed that heavy vehicles must drive more than 1000 m on ramps to reach their minimum speed. Moreover, when the slope is superior to 3. 2 %, tractor semi-trailer presents a strong decrease of their speed until 50 km/h. This situation represents a high risk of collision with other road users which drive at 80 - 90 km/h. Thus, both methods led to the determination of a risky configuration for heavy vehicles: ramps with a length superior to 1000 m and a slope superior to 3. 2 %. An application of this research work concerns design methods and guidelines. Indeed, this study provides threshold values than can be used by engineers to make mandatory specific planning like a lane for slow vehicles...|$|R
