40|$|The P 450 s are {{remarkable}} {{because there}} are so many of them and they do so many things. They are the products of a gene superfamily that includes representation from all phyla and many diverse species. At last count the cDNAs for more than 300 P 450 s had been cloned and sequenced (1), and many have been expressed as functional recombinant enzymes in transformed yeast, bacteria, or mammalian cells. The P 450 s are claimed to catalyze more than 60 different types of chemical reactions, including aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylations, N-and S- oxidations, epoxidations, and <b>dealkylations,</b> to name but a few examples. The P 450 s are characterized spectrophotometrically by the presence of an absorbance band at 450 nm when a sample of the reduced hemeprotein is gassed with carbon monoxide (2), hence the name P 450 to designate a pigment absorbing light at 450 nm. This characteristic absorbance fingerprint identifying a P 450 is due to the presence of a thiolate ligand to the heme iron of the hemeprotein (3), a fact that also contributes to its unique properties as an “oxygen-activating ” enzyme.

A marked induction of glutathione S- transferase and quinone reductase activities in liver was evident, {{as well as}} of glucuronosyl transferase and epoxide hydrolase activities and expression, but only at higher doses. Lung enzymes were not altered by the same treatment. In precision-cut rat liver slices glucoraphasatin caused a marked increase in epoxide hydrolase activity. Addition of myrosinase to form the isothiocyanate led to a marked rise in glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase and epoxide hydrolase activities and expression. Incubation of precision-cut rat liver slices with intact glucosinolates (glucoerucin and glucoraphanin) enhanced the O-dealkylations of methoxy- and ethoxyresorufin and elevated CYPl apoprotein levels; similar effects were observed in lung slices. Both glucosinolates increased hepatic epoxide hydrolase, glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase activities. Studies on the temporal induction of carcinogen-metabolising enzyme systems by glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in precision-cut rat liver slices indicated that a six- hour tissue exposure was required for induction of all enzymes to be manifested. The potential of the naturally-occurring R-sulforaphane to up-regulate carcinogen- metabolising enzyme in precision-cut rat liver slices and FAO cells was compared to that of S-sulforaphane; R -sulforaphane was superior in modulating these enzyme systems in both systems. Using the CALUX assay it was established that phenethyl isothiocyanate, erucin and sulforaphane were poor ligands to the Ah receptor. However, they effectively antagonised, III a non-competitive manner, the activation of the receptor by benzo[a]pyrene.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450 s) are {{exceptionally}} versatile monooxygenases, mediating hydroxylations of unactivated C H bonds, epoxidations, <b>dealkylations,</b> and N- and S-oxidations as well {{as other}} less common reactions. In the conventional view of the catalytic cycle, based upon studies of P 450 s in vitro, substrate binding to the Fe(III) resting state facilitates the first 1 -electron reduction of the heme. However, the resting state of P 450 s in vivo has not been examined. In the present study, whole cell difference spectroscopy of bacterial (CYP 101 A 1 and CYP 176 A 1, i. e. P 450 cam and P 450 cin) and mammalian (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 19, and CYP 3 A 4) P 450 s expressed within intact Escherichia coli revealed that both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of the enzyme are present in the absence of substrates. The relevance of this finding was supported by similar observations of Fe(II) P 450 heme in intact rat hepatocytes. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the bacterial forms in intact cells showed that a proportion of the P 450 in cells was in an EPR-silent form in the native state consistent with the presence of Fe(II) P 450. Coexpression of suitable cognate electron donors increased the degree of endogenous reduction to over 80 %. A significant proportion of intracellular P 450 remained in the Fe(II) form after vigorous aeration of cells. The addition of substrates increased the proportion of Fe(II) heme, suggesting a kinetic gate to heme reduction in the absence of substrate. In summary, these observations suggest that the resting state of P 450 s should be regarded as a mixture of Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms in both aerobic and oxygen-limited conditions...|$|R

Although AzM (in figure 2 named guthion) can be bioactivated by a {{cytochrome}} P450 (CYP450)-mediated desulfuration to its phosphate triester or oxon(gutoxon), {{it may also}} be detoxified by CYP itself (reaction 2 in figure 2).

50|$|Benzalkonium {{chloride}} degradation follows consecutive debenzylation, <b>dealkylation,</b> and demethylation steps producing benzyl chloride, alkyl dimethyl amine, dimethyl amine, long chain alkane, and ammonia. The intermediates, major, {{and minor}} products {{can then be}} broken down into CO2, H2O, NH3, and Cl-. The first step to the biodegradation of BAC is the fission or splitting of the alkyl chain from the quaternary nitrogen as shown in the diagram. This is done by abstracting the hydrogen from the alkyl chain by using a hydroxyl radical leading to a carbon centered radical. This results in benzyl dimethyl amine as the first intermediate and dodecanal as the major product. From here, benzyl dimethyl amine can be oxidized to benzoic acid using the Fenton process. The trimethyl amine group in dimethylbenzylamine can be cleaved to form a benzyl that can be further oxidized to benzoic acid. Benzoic acid uses hydroxylation (adding a hydroxyl group) to form p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Benzyldimethylamine can then be converted into ammonia by performing demethylation twice, which removes both methyl groups, followed by debenzylation, removing the benzyl group using hydrogenation. The diagram represents suggested pathways of the biodegradation of BAC for both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions of the surfactant. Since Stearalkonium chloride is a type of BAC, the biodegradation process should happen in the same manner.|$|E
