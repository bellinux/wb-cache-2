2500|$|In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That {{is not a}} stimulant, just a strengthener. If I hadn't, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give up. [...] On {{the first}} rest day, before {{we went into the}} Pyrenees, I had a first hormone injection. I had another one on the second day, {{at the start of the}} last week. You can't call that {{medically}} harmful, not if it's done under a doctor's control and within reason.|$|E
2500|$|After {{enduring}} {{several years}} of seeing his fame and notoriety usurped by Ruth, Cobb decided {{that he was going}} to show that swinging for the fences was no challenge for a top hitter. On May 5, 1925, he began a two-game hitting spree better than any even Ruth had unleashed. Sitting in the Tiger dugout, he told a reporter that, for the first time in his career, he was going to swing for the fences. That day, he went 6 for 6, with two singles, a double and three home runs. The 16 total bases set a new AL record, which stood until May 8, 2012 when Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers hit four home runs and a double for a total of 18 bases. The next day he had three more hits, two of which were home runs. The single his first time up gave him nine consecutive hits over three games. His five homers in two games tied the record set by Cap Anson of the old Chicago NL team in 1884. Cobb wanted to show that he could hit home runs when he wanted, but simply chose not to do so. At the end of the series, the 38-year-old veteran superstar had gone 12 for 19 with 29 total bases and then went happily back to his usual bunting and hitting-and-running. For his part, Ruth's attitude was that [...] "I could have had a lifetime [...]600 average, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hit them singles. The people were paying to see me hit home runs." [...] Even so, when asked in 1930 by Grantland Rice to name the best hitter he'd ever seen, Cobb answered, [...] "You can't beat the Babe. Ruth is one of the few who can take a terrific swing and still meet the ball solidly. His timing is perfect. [...] the combined power and eye of Ruth." ...|$|E

60|$|No. My {{will had}} nothing to do with it. Indeed, no sooner had I made that fateful noise than I became {{extremely}} sorry for it.

I gave him back his $3 and returned the dog, collect, to its owner. That second $3 I earned home to the Scot, and we enjoyed it, but the first $3, the money I got from the General, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lend.|$|E

The scramble for that visible plunder would have precipitated a disastrous ending. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defend it, too.

"I spent {{what was}} left of the night at a tavern near the station," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Locker, [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay all night if I had not taken the carriage. And I should have been in plenty of time for the morning train if I had not taken a walk before breakfast.

60|$|I hadn't {{noticed the}} mirror; didn't {{know it was}} there. And when I saw {{myself in the mirror}} I was frightened out of my wits. I don't allow any ghosts to bite me, and I took up a chair and smashed at it. A million pieces. Then I reflected. That's the way I always do, and it's {{unprofitable}} unless a man has had much experience that way and has clear judgment. And I had judgment, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay for that mirror if I hadn't recollected to say it was Twichell who broke it.|$|E
60|$|During the {{afternoon}} the ride grew hot, and very dusty. We {{came to a}} long, open valley where the dust lay several inches deep. It had been an unusually dry summer and fall--a fact that presaged poor luck for our hunting--and the washes and stream-beds were bleached white. We came to two water-holes, tanks the Arizonians called them, and they were vile mud-holes with green scum on the water. The horses drank, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be far gone from thirst before I would have slaked mine there. We faced west with the hot sun beating on us and the dust rising in clouds. No wonder that ride was interminably long.|$|E

6000|$|... “That’s {{the first}} {{sensible}} word I’ve had of ye the night,” said Hermiston. “I can tell ye, {{that would have}} been the end of it, the one way or the other; but it’s better ye should come there yourself, than what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hirstle ye.

If ye have to rowt, ye can rowt amang the kye; and the maist feck of the caapital punishment ye’re like to come across’ll be guddling trouts. Now, I’m for no idle lairdies; every man has to work, if it’s only at peddling ballants; to work, or to be wheeped, or to be haangit. If I set ye down at Hermiston I’ll have to see you work that place the way it has never been workit yet; ye must ken about the sheep like a herd; ye must be my grieve there, and I’ll see that I gain by ye.

6000|$|Very good. A dumpy, motherly little body, in decent shawl and {{the cleanest}} of {{possible}} nightcaps, stood before this toilet, {{hard at work}} apparently doing me the kindness of [...] "tidying out" [...] the [...] "meuble." [...] Open stood {{the lid of the}} work-box, open the top drawer; duly and impartially was each succeeding drawer opened in turn: not an article of their contents but was lifted and unfolded, not a paper but was glanced over, not a little box but was unlidded; and beautiful was the adroitness, exemplary the care with which the search was accomplished. Madame wrought at it like a true star, [...] "unhasting yet unresting." [...] I will not deny that it was with a secret glee I watched her. Had I been a gentleman I believe Madame would have found favour in my eyes, she was so handy, neat, thorough in all she did: some people's movements provoke the soul by their loose awkwardness, hers--satisfied by their trim compactness. I stood, in short, fascinated; but it was necessary to make an effort to break this spell a retreat must be beaten. The searcher might have turned and caught me; there would have been nothing for it then but a scene, and she and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come all at once, with a sudden clash, to a thorough knowledge of each other: down would have gone conventionalities, away swept disguises, and I should have looked into her eyes, and she into mine--we should have known that we could work together no more, and parted in this life for ever.|$|E
