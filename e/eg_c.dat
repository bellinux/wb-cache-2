25|$|Several state {{transition}} table types are used. The most common representation is shown below: the combination of current state (e.g. B) and input (e.g. Y) shows the next state (<b>e.g.</b> <b>C).</b> The complete action's information is not directly described in the table and can only be added using footnotes. A FSM definition including the full actions information is possible using state tables (see also virtual finite-state machine).|$|E
25|$|In Western music, a {{range of}} {{different}} music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the song's chord progression using chord names (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.|$|E
50|$|Apotome and limma are the {{two kinds}} of semitones defined in Pythagorean tuning. Namely, the apotome (about 113.69 cents, <b>e.g.</b> from <b>C</b> to C) is the {{chromatic}} semitone, or augmented unison (A1), while the limma (about 90.23 cents, <b>e.g.</b> from <b>C</b> to D) is the diatonic semitone, or minor second (m2).|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century {{changing}} musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities {{than the}} hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German Bauernleier 'peasant's lyre' and Bettlerleier 'beggar's lyre.' During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back {{to the attention of the}} upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is Nicolas Chédeville's Il pastor Fido, attributed to Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string vielle à roue. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> and G, or G and D).|$|E
25|$|The least {{expensive}} models only detect and display {{a small number}} of pitches, often those pitches that are required to tune a given instrument (e.g., E, A, D, G, B, E of standard guitar tuning). While this type of tuner is useful for bands that only use stringed instruments such as guitar and electric bass, it is not that useful for tuning brass or woodwind instruments. Tuners at the next price point offer chromatic tuning, the ability to detect and assess all the pitches in the chromatic scale (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C,</b> C, D, D, etc.). Chromatic tuners can be used for B and E brass instruments, such as saxophones and horns. Many models have circuitry that automatically detects which pitch is being played, and then compares it against the correct pitch. Less expensive models require the musician to specify the target pitch via a switch or slider. Most low- and mid-priced electronic tuners only allow tuning to an equal temperament scale.|$|E
25|$|The District {{is divided}} into four {{quadrants}} of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building. All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location, and house numbers are assigned based on the approximate number of blocks away from the Capitol. In most of the city, the streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> Street SW) and north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW). Two avenues, Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, line {{each side of the}} Mall. Many of the diagonal streets and avenues in Washington are named after states. Some of these streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House with the U.S. Capitol and Massachusetts Avenue, a section of which is informally known as Embassy Row given the number of foreign embassies located along the street.|$|E

25|$|Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{tends to}} be {{approximately}} {{twice the size of}} most Caligus spp. (<b>e.g.</b> <b>C.</b> elongatus, C. clemensi, etc.). The body consists of 4 regions: cephalothorax, fourth leg-bearing segment, genital complex, and abdomen. The cephalothorax forms a broad shield that includes all of the body segments up to the third leg-bearing segment. It acts like a suction cup in holding the louse on the fish. All species have mouth parts shaped as a siphon or oral cone (characteristic of the Siphonostomatoida). The second antennae and oral appendages are modified to assist in holding the parasite on the fish. The second pair of antennae is also used by males to grasp the female during copulation. The adult females are always significantly larger than males and develop a very large genital complex which in many species makes up the majority of the body mass. Two egg strings of 500 to 1000 eggs (L. salmonis), which darken with maturation, are approximately the same length as the female’s body. One female can produce 6-11 pairs of egg strings in a lifetime of approximately 7 months.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{they are}} used {{occasionally}} in classical music, typically in an educational setting for harmonic analysis, these names and symbols are [...] "universally used in jazz and popular music", in lead sheets, fake books, and chord charts, to specify the chords {{that make up the}} chord progression of a song or other piece of music. A typical sequence of a jazz or rock song in the key of C major might indicate a chord progression such as [...] "C – Am – Dm – G7". This chord progression instructs the performer to play, in sequence, a [...] "C Major" [...] chord, an [...] "a minor" [...] chord, a [...] "d minor" [...] chord, and a [...] "G dominant seventh" [...] chord. In a jazz context, players have the freedom to add sevenths, ninths and higher extensions to the chord. In some pop, rock and folk genres, triads are generally performed unless specified in the chord chart (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> Major 7).|$|E

2500|$|Power chords {{played on}} a heavily {{distorted}} and loudly amplified electric guitar are a foundational part of the sound and impact of heavy metal music and hardcore punk. Power chords are also used, though less commonly, on other instruments, such as Hammond organ in a traditional heavy metal genre (e.g., Deep Purple) or electric bass in heavy metal or grunge. In hard rock and heavy metal, in some cases where there are rapid chord changes in a lead sheet, these will be interpreted as power chords, {{even if they are}} not notated in [...] "C5"-style notation. For example, in the following chord progression, [...] "C ///|F///|G///|C B B A", if a fast tempo was played, many hard rock or heavy metal guitarists would play the [...] "C B Bb A" [...] measure as power chords. In other cases, a rock guitarist may decide to interpret a several bar reiteration of what appears notated on the lead sheet as a major or minor chord (<b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> Maj or C min) as C5, for the raw, stark effect that a power chord provides.|$|E
2500|$|Peacock bass {{make for}} great {{aquarium}} fish if {{kept in a}} large enough aquarium. The minimum tank size for an adult {{of one of the}} smaller species (<b>e.g.</b> <b>C.</b> ocellaris) would be 180 gallons, and nothing less than a 300-gallon tank should be reserved for C. temensis. As with all specialty fish, buy healthy stock from a reputable dealer. [...] Tankmates should be other fish that are too large to swallow, such as arowanas, other large cichlids, and larger members of the Loricariidae family. The peacock bass produces more waste and uses more energy than a typical tropical fish, therefore significant biological filtration and aeration are necessary. [...] Water changes of up to 25% weekly are required with such messy fish. Feeding should be 2 to 3 times a day for young peacock bass (under 4"), decreasing to once a day as they get older, then as an adult they should be fed every other day just enough to round off their stomachs. Peacock bass can be trained to take pellets, though occasionally this is a challenge. Avoid feeding them live goldfish (bait minnows would be a better choice). Even if they do not accept pellets, they may still eat other foods such as krill, bloodworms, and silversides. [...] The temperature of the aquarium should range from 78 to 84°F. Temperature plays a big role on the looks, behavior, and feeding habits of the fish. Lower temperatures cause the fish to eat less, and reduces the efficiency of the immune system. Higher temperatures also affect aggression, making the fish more aggressive. A strong lid is an absolute must with these fish, as they will often bolt and attempt to jump out of the tank if startled. For the same reason, sharp decorations should be avoided in a Cichla tank.|$|E
50|$|The major hexatonic {{scale is}} made from a major scale and {{removing}} the seventh note, <b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> D E F G A C. It can also be made from superimposing mutually exclusive major triads, <b>e.g.,</b> <b>C</b> E G and D F A.|$|E

25|$|In music theory, a {{distinction}} is made between a diatonic semitone, or minor second (an interval encompassing two staff positions, <b>e.g.</b> from <b>C</b> to D) and a chromatic semitone or augmented unison (an interval between two notes {{at the same}} staff position, <b>e.g.</b> from <b>C</b> to C). These are enharmonically equivalent when twelve-tone equal temperament is used, but {{are not the same}} thing in meantone temperament, where the diatonic semitone is distinguished from and larger than the chromatic semitone (augmented unison.)
