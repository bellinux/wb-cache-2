5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by Irish and German <b>immigrants.</b> <b>As</b> members moved uptown, the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E

5|$|An English {{cultural}} identity first {{emerged from the}} interaction of the Germanic immigrants of the 5th and 6th centuries and the indigenous Romano-British inhabitants. Although early medieval chroniclers described the <b>immigrants</b> <b>as</b> Angles and Saxons, they came from a much wider area across Northern Europe, and represented a range of different ethnic groups. Over the 6th century, however, these different groups began to coalesce into stratified societies across England, roughly corresponding to the later Angle and Saxon kingdoms recorded by Bede in the 8th century. By the 9th century, the term the Angelcynn was being officially used to refer to a single English people, and promoted for propaganda purposes by chroniclers and kings to inspire resistance to the Danish invasions.|$|E
40|$|Inspired by {{the recent}} {{implementation}} of the Arizona Immigration Law SB 1070, this study examines the use of metaphor as a persuasive technique in U. S. American newspapers. In particular, the metaphors are examined {{to see how they}} have affected views of Latino immigrants. The research examines two popular newspapers with six articles from The New York Times and five from The Washington Post. The data analysis discovered four primary metaphors present across popular newspaper rhetoric including: the <b>immigrant</b> <b>as</b> alien, the <b>immigrant</b> <b>as</b> criminal, the <b>immigrant</b> <b>as</b> river, and the <b>immigrant</b> <b>as</b> victim. Analysis of these metaphors reflects a shift in newspaper rhetoric towards a more realistic portrayal of the immigrant...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian <b>immigrants,</b> <b>as</b> well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{has one of}} {{the highest}} per-capita {{immigration}} rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, family reunification. The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2014, a total of 260,400 immigrants were admitted to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in the following years. a similar number of <b>immigrants</b> <b>as</b> in recent years. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented <b>immigrants</b> <b>as</b> the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of {{civilian}} administration, the Japanese population consisted of about a few hundred individuals, and reached a little over 2,000 by 1930. The Japanese resident population increased at an exponential rate from the mid-1930s onwards, and there were about 15,000 Japanese in Palau by 1938, the vast majority of whom were concentrated in Koror. The influx of Japanese immigrants fuelled the development of Koror into a city by 1939. The Palauans were quickly outnumbered by the Japanese, and constituted only about 16 percent of the city's population in 1937. The Japanese made up {{more than half of the}} islands' population, as well as 27% of Micronesia's Japanese population in a 1938 census. A large minority of the Japanese populace consisted of Okinawan <b>immigrants,</b> <b>as</b> well as a few Koreans. Palau's Japanese population was repatriated after the Japanese surrender, but people of Japanese-Palauan descent remained behind and constitute a large minority of Palau's population. A study done by the Sasakawa Pacific Island Nations Fund estimated that about 10% of Palauans are born to a Japanese father and Palauan mother, the vast majority of whom were born before 1945. Another study done by the Foundation for Advanced Studies in International Development from Japan in 2005 estimates that about 25% of Palau's populace have some Japanese ancestry.|$|E
