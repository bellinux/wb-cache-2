25|$|The {{economic}} troubles {{faced by}} corn farmers {{can help to}} explain why so many farmers are losing their farms; with decreased profits, and increased production costs many cannot stay in business. These farmers {{have to move to}} find work elsewhere. Along with this, the preference for monocultural agriculture in producing commodity crops has contributed to the depopulation of many rural areas across the American farm belt. Farming used to include the cultivation of a diversity of crops and livestock on one plot of land. When agriculture revolutionized into an industry with the responsibility to produce as much of a certain commodity as possible, it became more efficient to move the animals and other crops off of the land and use the space to grow commodity crops exclusively. The large supply of corn and other grains that resulted from this change made it more efficient to feed and raise livestock in concentrated animal feeding operations indoors rather than in grass pastures; small scale livestock farmers could not compete with the output produced by factory farms using cheap corn-based feed. The simplified practice of cultivating one crop along with the introduction of the tractor and other mechanized farming equipment resulted in less of a need for labor. Therefore, the output of commodity crops from the industrialized farm increased, while the population of surrounding communities decreased. In the early 1900s one fourth of Americans lived on a farm. Currently, fewer than 2 million Americans still farm. According to the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service, America lost 219,500 farms between 1981 and 1986. The remaining fields were merged to form larger operations. A sustainable rural community depends on the income from successful farms. If people are moving elsewhere to find work, either {{as a result of a}} failed farm or the decreased need for labor resulting from machines, the local economy suffers. With fewer people to support the <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> provide a tax base, local businesses, churches, schools and clinics may have to close their doors.|$|E
