500|$|He was on {{the bench}} {{for the first nine}} games of the 1990–91 campaign, but in his first start scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Sheffield United. However Venables dropped him to the bench for the {{following}} game, and Walsh became [...] "cynical and pissed off" [...] as he <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> he could do could displace either Stewart and Lineker, though he ended the season with 20 starts and 19 substitute appearances. He did though make an appearance at Wembley in the 1991 FA Cup Final, coming on for Vinny Samways 82 minutes into a 2–1 victory over Nottingham Forest.|$|E
500|$|The {{young couple}} moved to Chicago where Gygax {{continued}} as a shipping clerk at Kemper Insurance, and also found Mary Jo a job there too. (The company laid her off {{when she became}} pregnant with their first child.) [...] At Mary Jo's insistence, he also attended night classes in junior college to earn his high school diploma, {{and this time he}} excelled at his studies and made the college's Dean's List. He also took anthropology classes at the University of Chicago. Gygax also volunteered as a Republican precinct captain during the 1960 presidential election, and observed many infractions by his Democratic counterpart. When he threatened to report these, he was offered a full scholarship to the University of Chicago if he kept silent. Although Gygax ultimately did not report the infractions, since he <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> would be done, he also did not accept the scholarship.|$|E
500|$|Orci noted {{while the}} time travel story {{allowed them to}} alter some backstory {{elements}} such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not {{use it as a}} crutch to change everything and they tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode [...] "", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> in his script precluded it from the new film's backstory. There was a scene involving Kirk meeting Carol Marcus (who is revealed as the mother of his son in [...] ) as a child, but it was dropped because the film needed more time to introduce the core characters. Figuring out ways to get the crew together required some contrivances, which Orci and Kurtzman wanted to explain from old Spock as a way of the timeline mending itself, highlighting the theme of destiny. The line was difficult to write and was ultimately cut out.|$|E

500|$|Michael's first centric {{episode in}} season two was less well received. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said [...] "it wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily {{integrated}} flashbacks we've seen so far", as he <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> new was learned. He {{did not like}} Michael's on-Island storyline either, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes". Three episodes later, Jensen thought Michael's [...] "whiny dad act" [...] became [...] "increasingly tedious". When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in [...] "Two for the Road", Slocum called it the [...] "single biggest shocker in Lost history". C. K. Sample of AOL's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as [...] "a brilliant move", because [...] "one of their own [...] one of them". She added it was [...] "one of [...] season's most jaw-dropping moments". According to Perrineau, it made fans [...] "pissed off" [...] with Michael. Jensen praised Perrineau's acting, saying [...] "Michael's bloody betrayal is hard to swallow, but Harold Perrineau sells it". Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts [...] "Walt!", such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad, and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly. Perrineau co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for [...] "Best Ensemble - Drama Series.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} negative. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said the {{flashback}} storyline [...] "wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we've seen so far", as he <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> new was learned, and also disliked Michael's on-Island storyline, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that}} the actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes". Jensen however complimented the Hatch scenes, considering that Terry O'Quinn's performance and his interaction with Henry Ian Cusick were [...] "salvaging the first mediocre episode of the season". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it thought that revealing the Hatch events through different perspectives a [...] "fresh narrative approach", but complained about the lack of plot advancement, and considered the raft storyline [...] "three times as long as needed, with a really fake shark attack to boot". IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, praising Perrineau's performance and the flashback, but the website later ranked [...] "Adrift" [...] 80th out of the 115 Lost episodes, jokingly saying that the shark should have eaten Michael [...] "and save us a lot of 'Waaaaaalt!' and 'They took him. From my hands!' shout fests". A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the fourth worst of the series, describing it as [...] "boring". New York magazine listed [...] "Adrift" [...] in its [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost", complaining about [...] "grinding the story to a halt" [...] and the [...] "plodding" [...] flashback, and saying that the episode would have been improved if Sawyer and Michael reached land faster.|$|E
2500|$|Heigl {{responded by}} saying that Rogen had [...] "handled that so beautifully," [...] and that she <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> but [...] "love and respect" [...] for him.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 23 Stanton complained of pains in his head, neck and spine. His doctor, Surgeon General Joseph Barnes, was called. As had {{happened}} on many nights before, Stanton's asthma had made breaths come with some difficulty. Stanton's lungs and heart felt constricted, which kept Stanton's wife and children, as well as Barnes, by his bedside. Stanton's condition began to improve at midnight, until he began, as Marvin states, [...] " [...] so strenuously for air that someone ran for the pastor of the Church of the Epiphany, and soon after he arrived Stanton lost consciousness." [...] At about 3 am, Barnes checked Stanton's pulse and breathing but <b>felt</b> <b>nothing.</b> Stanton died on ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vision of}} Mary was {{described}} as being beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white cloak, hanging in full folds and fastened at the neck. The crown appeared of a golden brightness, of a deeper hue, than the striking whiteness of the robe she wore; the upper parts of the crown {{appeared to be a}} series of sparkles, or glittering crosses. She {{was described as}} [...] "deep in prayer", with her eyes raised to heaven, her hands raised to the shoulders or a little higher, the palms inclined slightly to the shoulders. Bridget Trench [...] "went in immediately to kiss, as I thought, the feet of the Blessed Virgin; but I <b>felt</b> <b>nothing</b> in the embrace but the wall, and I wondered why I could not feel with my hands the figures which I had so plainly and so distinctly seen".|$|E
