40|$|This work {{describes}} the fabrication of hierarchical 3 D Nafion enhanced carbon aerogels (NECAGs) for sensing applications via a <b>fast</b> <b>freeze</b> drying method. Graphene oxide, multiwalled carbon nanotubes and Nafion were mixed and extruded into liquid nitrogen {{followed by the}} removal of ice crystals by freeze drying. The addition of Nafion enhanced the mechanical strength of NECAGs and effective control of the cellular morphology and pore size was achieved. The resultant NECAGs demonstrated high strength, low density, and high specific surface area and can achieve a modulus of 20 kPa, an electrical conductivity of 140 S m- 1, and a specific capacity of 136. 8 F g- 1 after reduction. Therefore, NECAG monoliths performed well as a gas sensor and as a biosensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. The remarkable sensitivity of 8. 52 x 103 μA mM- 1 cm- 2 was obtained in dopamine (DA) detection, which is two orders of magnitude better than the literature reported values using graphene aerogel electrodes made from a porous Ni template. These outstanding properties make the NECAG a promising electrode candidate {{for a wide range}} of applications.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{dissolution}} behavior of lipophilic drugs, a novel bottom-up process based upon freeze drying {{which allows for}} the production of nanocrystalline particles was developed: "controlled crystallization during freeze drying". This novel process could strongly increase the dissolution behavior of fenofibrate. For example at a drug load of 30 % w/w, 80 % of the drug dissolved within 10 min from tablets prepared from the controlled crystallized dispersions, while from tablets prepared from the physical mixture only 50 % was dissolved after 120 min. Furthermore it was found that <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using a solution with a lower water/tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) ratio resulted in faster dissolution, indicating that the crystalline dispersions contained smaller crystals. Crystallization of the drug could occur during freezing or during drying. When crystallization occurs during <b>freezing,</b> <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using solutions with a lower water/TBA ratio results in the formation of more nuclei and consequently smaller crystals. When crystallization occurs during drying, <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> or using solutions with a higher water/TBA ratio results in the formation of smaller solvent crystals and therefore smaller interstitial spaces which contain the freeze-concentrated fraction. Since crystallization occurs in the freeze-concentrated fraction {{and the size of the}} crystals are limited to the size of the interstitial spaces, smaller crystals are formed in these situations.

Materials and Methods: After preparing the final suspensions of B. coagulans and Bacillus subtilis subsp.

Heat shock treatments of the spores were carried out at 68 oC for 15, 20, and 30 min as well as at 80 oC for 10 and 15 min. Concentrations of the examined probiotic sporeformers were determined simultaneously by plate enumerations and microscopically determined counts. Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of SPSS were used for statistical analysis of the data. Analysis of DoE results was carried out using Minitab. Results: The results presented here show that the highest recovery rates for B. coagulans (14. 75 log CFU/mL) and B. subtilis spores (14. 80 log CFU/mL) were under a heat shock condition of 68 °C for 20 min in nutrient agar (p< 0. 05). In addition, the survival rates of B. coagulans and B. subtilis spores under the <b>fast</b> <b>freezing</b> and subsequent thawing condition were about 90 % and 88 %, respectively.

Two cryodevices are available, which were recently evaluated. Both devices showed promising results, but differed in clinical outcome. To explain these differences, more understanding of the working mechanism of both devices is required. Objective: This experimental study was designed to investigate and compare the thermal behavior of an argon gas- and a liquid nitrogen-based device. Thermal behavior constitutes: (1) minimum tissue temperature (°C), (2) the freezing rate (°C/min). The thermal behavior was measured inside and on the outer surface of the scar. Both devices were tested ex vivo and in vivo. Results: Ex vivo, when determining the maximum freezing capacity, the argon gas device showed a higher end temperature compared to the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 120. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 140. °C) and a <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate (argon gas: - 1300. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 145. °C/min). In vivo, measured inside the keloid, the argon gas device showed a lower end temperature than the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 36. 4. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 8. 1. °C) and a <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate (argon gas: - 14. 7. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 5. °C/min).

30|$|When {{graphite}} oxide is dispersed in water, a sonication-free exfoliation {{method was}} proposed by Ogino et al [34]. This method is a repetitive freeze-thaw cycle {{which consists of}} <b>fast</b> <b>freezing</b> graphite oxide solution and then thawing of the frozen solid. As shown in Fig.  2 (2), the graphite oxide aqueous solution is first freezing in a liquid N 2 bath and then the sample with ice is thawing in the water bath. After six freeze-thaw cycles, graphite oxide is efficiently exfoliated with minimal fragmentation and yields about 80  % of GO. Further research finds that this method is effective for graphite oxide with high degrees of oxidation (C/O atomic ratios ≤ 2.6) for graphite structure retained would prevent the exfoliation. What is more, <b>faster</b> <b>freezing</b> rate is more efficient for exfoliation and forms high concentration GO dispersions [36]. Another sonication-free exfoliation method injects and maintains CO 2 gas in interlayer of graphite interlayers by freezing and uses the ejection pressure of CO 2 gas to disperse the graphite oxide [35]. In Fig.  2 (3), graphite oxide swells in water with increasing the humidity and then high pressure CO 2 is injected and cooled down to − 30  °C to induce ice of water to surround the graphite oxide. As the surrounding ice melts, the pressure of ejecting gas spontaneously exfoliated and disperses the GO without sonication. The lateral size of GO exfoliated with above strategies is much larger than with sonication [26, 30, 35, 36]. Besides these sonication-free methods to maintain the lateral size of GO, a multi-step sonication exfoliation was studied without reducing the size of sheets but increasing the yield in contrast to continuous sonication [37].|$|R

Thawing in cold water (packed in low-density polyethylene bags and placed in cold water at approximately 10 °C for 2 hours and 15 minutes) presented the best results due to lesser damage to the cell structure, as shown by the lower drip loss, higher moisture content, and greater tenderness of the samples compared to those thawed using the other methods. Histological examination showed that muscle fiber structural features and organization were maintained.

40|$|Effects of concentration, {{freezing}} rate, and noncrystallizing cosolute on {{the physical}} state of mannitol after freeze drying were investigated. When mannitol is present as a single solute, slow freezing of 10 % (w/v) mannitol produces a mixture of the α and the β polymorphs, whereas <b>fast</b> <b>freezing</b> of the same solution produces the δ form. <b>Fast</b> <b>freezing</b> of 5 % (w/v) mannitol results primarily in the β form. When a noncrystallizing cosolute is present, the relative threshold concentration above which crystalline mannitol is detected in the freeze-dried solid by x-ray diffraction is about 30 % (w/w). Glass transition temperature of mixtures of mannitol and disaccharides are reasonably well predicted by the Gordon-Taylor equation. ^ Crystallization of mannitol from freeze-dried solids during storage below Tg {{and the influence of}} viscoelastic properties of an amorphous solid below Tg on mannitol crystallization were studied. Fragility of freeze-dried solids was measured using two different methods. It was determined from measuring the width of the glass transition (ΔTg) and from measuring the enthalpy recovery due to molecular mobility below Tg using DSC. The data suggest that the fragility measurement from the enthalpy recovery data may be the more rigorous method. When mannitol/disaccharide mixtures were stored 10 – 15 °C below their glass transition temperature, mannitol did not crystallize for at least 20 -week period. When mannitol/sucrose (a fragile glass former) and mannitol/maltodextrin (a strong glass former) were stored at about 5 °C below Tg, only mannitol/maltodextrin mixture showed an increase in mannitol crystallinity. This supports the hypothesis that mannitol is less likely to crystallize from the fragile glass mixture compared to the strong glass mixture. The reason is that at the same temperature interval below the glass transition temperature, (Tg-T), the fragile glass system will more quickly increase in viscosity and have less molecular mobility because of its narrow glass transition region. ...|$|R
40|$|The freeze {{denaturation}} {{of model}} proteins, LDH, ADH, and catalase, {{was investigated in}} absence of cryoprotectants using a microcryostage under well-controlled freezing and thawing rates. Most of the experimental data were obtained from a study using a dilute solution with an enzyme concentration of 0. 025 g/l. The dependence of activity recovery of proteins on the freezing and thawing rates showed a reciprocal and independent effect, that is, slow freezing (at a freezing rate about 1 degrees C/min) and fast thawing (at a thawing rate > 10 degrees C/min) produced higher activity recovery, whereas <b>fast</b> <b>freezing</b> with slow thawing resulted in more severe damage to proteins. With minimizing the freezing concentration and pH change of buffer solution by using a potassium phosphate buffer, this phenomenon could be ascribed to surface-induced denaturation during freezing and thawing process. Upon the <b>fast</b> <b>freezing</b> (e. g., when the freezing rate > 20 degrees C/min), small ice crystals and a relatively large surface area of ice-liquid interface are formed, which increases the exposure of protein molecules to the ice-liquid interface and hence increases {{the damage to the}} proteins. During thawing, additional damage to proteins is caused by recrystallization process. Recrystallization exerts additional interfacial tension or shear on the entrapped proteins and hence causes additional damage to the latter. When buffer solutes participated during freezing, the activity recovery of proteins after freezing and thawing decreased due to the change of buffer solution pH during freezing. However, the patterns of the dependence on freezing and thawing rates of activity recovery did not change except for that at extreme low freezing rates (< 0. 5 degrees C/min). The results exhibited that the freezing damage of protein in aqueous solutions could be reduced by changing the buffer type and composition and by optimizing the freezing-thawing protocol...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem and}} the methods {{available}} <b>Fast</b> <b>freezing</b> (cryofixation) combined with freeze-fracture electron microscopy has shown that biological membrane fusion is a locally restricted and fast event (Plattner, 1981, 1991). It is difficult to capture, since {{it is at the}} limits of the temporal (0. 1 to 1 ms, depending on conditions, like sample geometry etc.) and spatial (~ 3 nm) resolution avail-able with this methodology (Plattner and Bachmann, 1982). It has been established that some fusion sites contain intramembraneous particles (IMPs, equivalent to integral proteins) and a diffuse mass of proteins between mem-branes to be fused (Plattner, 1981, 1991). Later on, patch-clamp analysis of membrane capacitance changes (Neher and Marty, 1982) has not only refined the concept of fast focal fusion, but recently has also provided a new mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} freeze-drying, {{blanching}} and freezing rate pre-treatments on the microstructure {{and on the}} rehydration properties of winter carrots were studied by µCT, SEM, MRI and NMR techniques. The freezing rate determines the size of ice crystals being formed that leave pores upon drying. Their average size (determined by µCT) can be predicted in a quantitative manner by considering dendritic growth and freezing rates. Blanching as a pre-treatment, however, did not affect pore size distribution induced by freeze-drying. Upon rehydration of the freeze-dried carrots, PFG NMR and MRI show that cellular compartments were not restored and instead a porous network with permeable barriers is formed. Blanching pre-treatment introduced a less connected and more anisotropic porous network if followed by <b>fast</b> <b>freezing,</b> indicating that more of the native cell wall morphology is preserved...|$|R
