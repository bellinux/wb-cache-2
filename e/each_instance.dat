5|$|The French {{attacked}} St. John's {{again in}} 1705 (Siege of St. John's), and captured it in 1708 (Battle of St. John's), devastating civilian structures with fire on <b>each</b> <b>instance.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a fixed graph H {{on the right side}} of <b>each</b> <b>instance</b> is also called the H-coloring problem. When H is the complete graph K'k, this is the graph k-coloring problem, which is solvable in polynomial time for k = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. For {{the sake}} of clarity, we can safely assume that <b>each</b> Reducer <b>instance</b> {{receives}} the tuples for exactly one key; we can hence parameterize <b>each</b> such <b>instance</b> with the key it has been assigned.|$|R
5000|$|Keys: An attribute, or {{combination}} of attributes, of an entity whose values uniquely identify <b>each</b> entity <b>instance.</b> <b>Each</b> such set constitutes a candidate key.|$|R
30|$|This plot {{demonstrates}} overlapping {{proportion of}} each PPI attributes to {{positive and negative}} instances according {{to the type of}} attributes. ‘pos’ means overlap between <b>each</b> positive <b>instances</b> in a dataset and PPI attributes, and ‘neg’ means overlaps between <b>each</b> negative <b>instances</b> in a dataset and PPI attributes.|$|R
5|$|During each of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} attacks on the firebases and relief column, communist forces suffered horrendous casualties from aircraft and armed helicopter attacks, artillery bombardment, and small arms fire. In <b>each</b> <b>instance,</b> however, they were pressed home with a professional competence and determination that both impressed and shocked those that observed them. According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight sapper battalions – approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area.|$|E
5|$|International Street is a themed area at Canada's Wonderland {{theme park}} in Vaughan, Ontario. Similar to the Main Street, U.S.A. {{sections}} of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, {{it acts as}} an entrance way to the park. The street ends at Wonder Mountain, a visual landmark for navigating {{through much of the}} park. A similar format is used in Kings Island and Kings Dominion theme parks, albeit with a replica of the Eiffel Tower at the end in both parks. In <b>each</b> <b>instance,</b> the International Street section was created while the park was owned by Kings Entertainment Company, then transferred to Paramount Parks, and finally to the current owners, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.|$|E
5|$|The Weapons Platoon, after {{becoming}} {{separated from the}} rest of the company, encountered North Koreans on the trail it was following three times in the night, but in <b>each</b> <b>instance</b> neither side fired, each going on its way. At dawn, the platoon ambushed a group of North Koreans, killing 13 and capturing three North Koreans. From the body of a North Korean officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps. These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} Raylectron instancing (or proxies as {{some call}} it) can produce {{extremely}} large models using very little memory. The Raylectron instancing capability is widely used by landscape designiner such as for trees, bushes and other objects. One unique capability is that <b>each</b> <b>instances</b> can be individually rotated and scalled, producing a different look using a single instance of an object.|$|R
50|$|One popular {{configuration}} {{was to run}} Apache HTTP Server 2.2 as a {{load balancer}} using mod_proxy_balancer in conjunction with several Mongrel <b>instances.</b> <b>Each</b> Mongrel <b>instance</b> would run on a separate TCP port, configured via the mongrel_cluster management utility. Until recently, Twitter was a notable instance of this configuration.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiments}} are deployed on Amazon EC 2 [28] with the instance type: m 1.small. <b>Each</b> <b>instance’s</b> configuration is as follows: 1.7 GHz 2006 Intel Xeon processor, 1.7 GB memory, 160 GB storage. We employed 20 <b>instances</b> and <b>each</b> {{of them is}} configured with a maximum of 2 map tasks and 1 reduce task (we don’t have reduce tasks for PML) for task trackers.|$|R
5|$|Commissioner Gordon informs Batman {{that the}} {{patients}} of Arkham Asylum {{have taken over}} the facility, threatening to murder the staff unless Batman agrees to meet with them. Among the hostages are Dr. Charles Cavendish, Arkham's administrator, and Dr. Ruth Adams, a therapist. The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in <b>each</b> <b>instance</b> increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in <b>each</b> <b>instance,</b> the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In <b>each</b> <b>instance,</b> Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E

Players can {{determine}} how many turns they want to spend fighting the monster (with 1 turn corresponding to 1 AP). Players are ranked in <b>each</b> raid <b>instance</b> by how much they contributed to defeat the monster, and high ranking players in <b>each</b> raid <b>instance</b> can get valuable prizes.|$|R
