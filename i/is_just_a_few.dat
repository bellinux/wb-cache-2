25|$|In {{the initial}} {{years of the}} ULFA {{movement}} (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both {{urban and rural areas}} of Assam), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Upper and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late Heerak Jyoti Mahanta hailed from a place which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometres from the state capital Guwahati. However, with the Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the tribal areas for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam. The Ulfa also has strong following among the Naga people in Assam.|$|E
500|$|With a {{production}} budget of , principal photography began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on , 2012. After seven weeks, filming concluded on , 2012. As {{a way to}} keep down production costs, a bulk of the filming took place around the greater New Orleans area– mostly south of the Red River country in the north of the state, where the historic Northup was enslaved. Among locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Magnolia, a plantation in Schriever, Louisiana, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> miles from one of the historic sites where Northup was held. [...] "To know that we were right there in the place where these things occurred was so powerful and emotional," [...] said actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.

500|$|In {{addition}} to being a primary factor {{in the development of the}} largest valleys, the dike complex plays another important role that of creating and maintaining the water table. Hawaiian lava is extremely permeable and porous. Rainwater easily seeps into the lava, creating a large lens of fresh water below the island surface. In most places, the top of the water table <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feet from sea level, as the fresh water lens is floating on salt water. Unlike porous lava flows, however, dikes cool underground into dense rock with few cracks and vesicles. The dikes act as impermeable vertical walls through which groundwater cannot flow. Deep layers of ash compact into impermeable layers between lava flows, preventing percolation of the rainwater. Rainwater that would ordinarily seep right through the ground gets trapped in the dike [...] "reservoirs," [...] located well above sea level. The groundwater is confined to a flow along the dike until it finds a means to escape.|$|E

[...] In particular, Patel pointed to Apple's AirPlay protocol as an example of an established competitor with many more features. TechCrunch's review of the device said, [...] "Even with a bug or two rearing its head, the Chromecast is easily worth its $35 pricetag." [...] Gizmodo gave the device a positive review, highlighting the ease of setup and sharing video. In comparing the device to competitors, the review said, [...] "Chromecast isn't Google's version of Apple TV, and it's not trying to be... But Chromecast also costs a third of what those devices do, and has plenty of potential given that its SDK <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days old." ...|$|E

2500|$|Undeveloped but {{extensive}} coal deposits exist along Youngs Creek {{and adjacent}} creeks, which {{flow into the}} Tongue River just upstream from the Tongue River Reservoir. [...] This large and (as yet) untapped deposit of coal <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{miles south of the}} large open pit coal mines already being operated by Kiewit. The upper 15 miles of Youngs Creek lies on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana, and the Crow Tribe owns the coal beds underlying this portion of the creek. The last 3 miles of the creek lie between the reservation boundary and the Tongue River, in Wyoming. As to the coal beds on the Crow reservation, the Secretary of the Interior approved a coal lease negotiated by the Crow Tribe with Shell Oil Company in 1983 to develop this coal resource. The lease had extensive long term benefits for the Crow tribe, and required payments to the tribe to start at a future point of time even in the event the coal was not mined. Shell paid the tribe a bonus to cancel this lease in 1985, because of poor market conditions, and because of Shell's uncertainties on how Montana's severance tax would be applied to coal owned by the Crow Tribe. Compared to Otter Creek these coal resources are easier to develop—the coal resources of Young's creek lies within five to ten miles of the railroad spur line which is used to ship coal from the nearby open pit mines being operated by Kiewit in the Decker, Montana area, and the communities of Sheridan and Ranchester already exist to serve as a base for the work force needed to develop coal mines at Youngs Creek.|$|E
