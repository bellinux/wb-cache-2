40|$|We {{construct}} energy-optimized resonating {{valence bond}} wavefunctions {{as a means}} to sketch out the zero-temperature phase diagram of the square-lattice quantum Heisenberg model with competing nearest- (J 1) and next-nearest-neighbour (J 2) interactions. Our emphasis is not on achieving an accurate representation of the magnetically disordered <b>intermediate</b> phase (<b>centred</b> on a relative coupling g = J 2 /J 1 ~ 1 / 2 and whose exact nature is still controversial) but on exploring whether and how the Marshall sign structure breaks down {{in the vicinity of the}} phase boundaries. Numerical evaluation of two- and four-spin correlation functions is carried out stochastically using a worm algorithm that has been modified to operate in either of two modes: one in which the sublattice labelling is fixed beforehand and another in which the worm manipulates the current labelling so as to sample various sign conventions. Our results suggest that the disordered phase evolves continuously out of the (pi,pi) Neel phase and largely inherits its Marshall sign structure; on the other hand, the transition from the magnetically ordered (pi, 0) phase is strongly first order and involves an abrupt change in the sign structure and spatial symmetry as the results of a level crossing.

40|$|The {{arguments}} in Nigeria {{over whether the}} urban or the rural areas should be given greater priority in national development appear somewhat misplaced and unhelpful because the {{urban and rural areas}} are mutually interdependent, with many complex links and interactions between them, and the constant movements of people, goods, money, ideas and information from one to the other. For this reason, the Habitat Agenda of the Istanbul City Summit advocates "an integrated approach to promote balanced and mutually supportive urban-rural development (through) strong local and national institutions that place emphasis on rural-urban linkages, and treat villages and towns as two sides of the human settlement continuum" The paper considers ways to overcome the traditional divide between urban and rural planning and development, and by so doing achieve a balanced and more sustainable pattern of development and poverty reduction. It focuses on the promotion of small and <b>intermediate</b> urban <b>centres</b> as an appropriate middle course which combines the advantages of urban as well as rural approaches to development, but without the disadvantages of large population concentrations in a few metropolitan areas, or of the wide dispersal of investments and scarce resources in scattered villages too small to support basic services.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{accumulation}} of technological competence is a path-dependent and context-specific process, being partly firm-specific and partly location-specific. MNCs spread the competence base of the firm, and acquire new technological assets or sources of competitive advantage. For their part indigenous firms benefit from local knowledge spillovers from MNCs, given the access of the latter to complementary streams of knowledge being developed in other locations. This paper examines how the particular corporate technological trajectories of multinational corporations (MNCs) have interacted with spatially-specific resources for the creation of new competence in some of the leading regions in Europe. Yet foreign investments, and the associated skills and capabilities that they bring, are arguably of crucial importance as a catalyst for local growth: learning curve advantages are mainly people- and institution-embodied and regional systems may substantially benefit from global corporations investing in innovation and local human capital. Although a break has thus occurred with the conventional economic approach - in which spatial factors shaping innovation were usually considered secondary (if not thoroughly negligible) - too little is still known about the regional scope with respect to the geographical location of innovatory capacity in the global economy. This is all the more relevant in the presence of an in-depth process of economic integration, as is the case of the EU, which arose from the need to define the problems, and the policies aimed at solving them, in terms of geographical location and centre/periphery economic convergence. We use data on the patents granted in the United States to large firms for inventions emanating from research facilities located in eight selected European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK) over a 27 year period (1969 - 1995). The location-specific patent data is complemented through the use of other indicators such as the regional distribution of expenditure on basic scientific research, and the R&D expenditure personnel given by the EU database New-Cronos-Regio. The aim is to improve our understanding of some aspects of the effects of Innovation and Globalisation on Firms and Regions - i. e. technological spillovers - by examining the patterns of technological (by technological field of the largest firms) and production (by industry of the output of the largest firms) specialisation in each region. Differences between the two specialisation profiles may be indicative of technological diversification by industry, and hence potential technological overlaps between industries. These overlaps may be more pronounced in higher order centres, due to their greater technological breadth (which may show a greater technological diversification within the typical industry represented in the region, and not merely a greater span of industries). We then distinguish between <b>intermediate</b> <b>centres</b> (with significant levels of technologically focused activity) and lower order regions (backward regions, with little activity at all). The patterns of technological diversification of industries are then checked by examining which firms are responsible for a positive technological specialisation {{in the case of a}} region that lacks specialisation in the equivalent industrial category, and how this fits into the overall pattern of technological diversification of the firms in question. ...|$|R

40|$|UN Habitat {{reports that}} though Africa {{is still the}} least urbanised {{continent}} of the world, it however, has the fastest rate of urbanisation. Two third of this population reside in small and <b>intermediate</b> coastal <b>centres</b> with 60 % in cities of less than 500, 000 inhabitants. The major trend in Africa like {{other places in the}} world shows that a larger portion of these urban areas are located in the coastal zones. In West Africa the rate of this growth is higher than the continent’s average. Urbanisation in West Africa is poverty driven with very low socio-economic transformation; this has led to the evolution of different lifestyles among the people even in rich countries like Nigeria. This rapid urban growth has led to the drowning so to say of the original inhabitants of those areas. In the area, the current thematic coastal issues of climate change and sea level rise have captured researchers interest with little focus on lifestyles of the inhabitants of these cities. The study therefore aimed at examining the possible evolution of new lifestyles over time resulting from the urban expansion and the wider implications of these especially for the socially excluded- fisher folks, wetland farmers, indigenous people, women and the youth of West Africa in these urban centres.

40|$|An {{addition}} of 1. 5 at% Co to Ti- 48 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb (in at%) transformed the alloy from essentially unsinterable to fully sinterable at 1300 degrees C. This, {{together with a}} simple powder coating process developed recently, has allowed near-net shape fabrication of the alloy {{for the first time}} by cold compaction and pressureless sintering. The {{addition of}} Co results in the formation of an <b>intermediate</b> face <b>centred</b> cubic (fcc) CoAl 2 Ti phase prior to 1220 degrees C during heating. It subsequently reacts with an alpha phase leading to the formation of a Co-containing, wettable sintering liquid through a two-step process, CoAl 2 Ti+alpha -> Liquid at 1256. 2 degrees C and CoAl 2 Ti+alpha ->gamma-TiAl+Liquid at 1267. 2 degrees C, and therefore full densification of the alloy. Without Co, sintering of the Ti- 48 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb alloy powder at 1300 degrees C is controlled by the slow self-diffusion of Ti and interdiffusion of Ti and Al according to the activation energy determined.
