5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, {{as seen in}} the <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> of the Eyrie {{and from}} the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the film}} was {{scheduled}} to shoot on five sound stages at Los Angeles: Downey, Sony, Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal. Filming moved to Chandler Field in Fresno, California, substituting for Mexico City International Airport, on October 11, 2007. After shooting aerial shots of Chandler Airport and a DC-3 {{on the morning of}} October 12, 2007, filming wrapped. Although he originally found no need for re-shoots after viewing his first cut of the film, Spielberg decided to add an <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> filmed on February 29, 2008, in Pasadena, California.|$|E

25|$|The {{filming of}} the third season began in early July 2012, and {{concluded}} with the wrap of the unit filming in Iceland on November 24, 2012. Filming in Iceland, for scenes {{in five of the}} season's ten episodes, took place near Akureyri and Lake Mývatn. Dimmuborgir was used as the location for Mance Rayder's wildling army camp, and the Grjótagjá cave was used as <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> of Jon Snow and Ygrite in the cave although most of this scene was filmed in the studio. The filming in Iceland lasted eight days, as opposed to nearly a month for season 2. Kit Harington (Jon Snow) broke an ankle in an accident in July, which required the Iceland shoots to be pushed back to give him time to heal, as well as the occasional use of a body double.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{left many}} filmgoers confused. In his scathing {{review of the}} film, Roger Ebert says that he cannot believe [...] "that the director, Joseph Sargent, would film this final climactic scene so incompetently {{that there is not}} even an <b>establishing</b> <b>shot,</b> so {{we have to figure out}} what {{happened}} on the basis of empirical evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Matte {{paintings}} of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's Treasure Island, which already had appropriate art deco architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating [...] "Berlin Flughafen". The <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings {{were used for the}} sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.|$|E

500|$|The National Trust {{continued}} the restoration work, and added new roofs to the towers and gatehouse. Excavations were resumed in 1970, and the moat {{was once again}} drained. Bodiam Castle was used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in an <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> identifying it as [...] "Swamp Castle" [...] in the [...] "Tale of Sir Lancelot" [...] sequence. The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England carried out {{a survey of the}} earthworks surrounding Bodiam Castle in 1990. In the 1990s, Bodiam Castle was at the centre of a debate in castle studies over the balance between militaristic and social interpretations of such sites. The arguments focused on elements such as the apparent strength of the defences– such as the imposing moat – and elements of display. It has been suggested that the moat could have been drained in a day because the embankment surrounding it was not substantial, and that as such it did not pose a serious obstacle to an attacker. Also, the large windows in the castle's exterior were defensive weak points. The castle is a Scheduled Monument, which means it is a [...] "nationally important" [...] historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. Today the castle is open to the public, and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, nearly 170,000 people visited in 2014. In the opinion of historian Charles Coulson, Bodiam [...] "represents the popular ideal of a medieval castle".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{is one of}} Hitchcock's most {{experimental}} and [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} experiments ever attempted by a major director working with big box-office names", abandoning many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes.

2500|$|Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's {{encounter}} with {{the man behind the}} counter at the gas station. [...] "Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the <b>establishing</b> <b>shot</b> of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth." ...|$|E
