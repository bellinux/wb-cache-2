Our earlier studies suggested that human <b>factor</b> VII/tissue <b>factor</b> cannot activate <b>factor</b> IX. Studies have now been extended to the activation of <b>factor</b> X. Reaction mixtures were made with purified <b>factor</b> VII, X, and tissue factor; in some experiments antithrombin III and heparin were added to prevent back-activation of <b>factor</b> VII. <b>Factor</b> X was activated at similar rates in reaction mixtures containing either <b>factor</b> VII or <b>factor</b> VIIa after an initial 30 -sec lag with <b>factor</b> VII. In reaction mixtures with <b>factor</b> VII a linear activation of <b>factor</b> X was established several minutes before cleavage of 125 I-labeled <b>factor</b> VII to the two-chain activated molecule was demonstrable on gel profiles. Adding antithrombin III and heparin blocked activation of <b>factor</b> X by <b>factor</b> VII/tissue <b>factor</b> but not by <b>factor</b> VIIa/tissue <b>factor.</b> When the antithrombin III and heparin were added 1 min after the other reagents, <b>factor</b> VII/tissue <b>factor</b> activation of <b>factor</b> X was not blocked. These data suggest that <b>factor</b> VII/tissue <b>factor</b> cannot activate measurable amounts of <b>factor</b> X over several minutes. Overall, our results {{support the hypothesis that}} a rapid preferential activation of <b>factor</b> VII bound to tissue <b>factor</b> by trace amounts of <b>factor</b> Xa is a key early step in tissue factor-dependent blood coagulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Factor</b> VII can be activated, to a {{molecule}} giving shorter clotting times with tissue <b>factor,</b> by incubating plasma with kaolin or by clotting plasma. The mechanisms of activation differ. With kaolin, activated <b>Factor</b> XII (XIIa) was the apparent principal activator. Thus, <b>Factor</b> VII was not activated in <b>Factor</b> XII-deficient plasma, was partially activated in prekallikrein and high-molecular weight kininogen (HMW kininogen) -deficient plasmas, but was activated in other deficient plasmas. After clotting, activated <b>Factor</b> IX (IXa) was the apparent principal activator. Thus, <b>Factor</b> VII was not activated in <b>Factor</b> XII-,HMW kininogen-, XI-, and IX-deficient plasmas, but was activated in <b>Factor</b> VIII-, X-, and V-deficient plasmas. In further studies, purified small-fragment <b>Factor</b> XIIa (β-XIIa), kallikrein, and <b>Factor</b> IXa {{were added to}} partially purified <b>Factor</b> VII and to plasma. High concentrations of β-XIIa activated <b>Factor</b> VII in a purified system; much lower concentrations of β-XIIa activated <b>Factor</b> VII in normal plasma but not in prekallikrein or HWM kininogen-deficient plasmas. Kallikrein alone failed to activate partially purified <b>Factor</b> VII but did so when purified <b>Factor</b> IX was added. Kallikrein also activated <b>Factor</b> VII in normal, <b>Factor</b> XII-, and <b>Factor</b> IX-deficient plasmas. Purified <b>Factor</b> IXa activated partially purified <b>Factor</b> VII and had no additional indirect activating effect {{in the presence of}} plasma.

To understand why prophylactic treatment with both products is efficacious, {{we conducted a}} pharmacokinetic study. Materials and MethodsTen <b>factor</b> VII deficient patients were treated with either recombinant activated (20 μg/kg) or plasma-derived (25 IU/kg) <b>factor</b> VII in a cross-over design. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed through activated <b>factor</b> VII activity, <b>factor</b> VII clotting activity, and <b>factor</b> VII antigen levels on depicted time points. ResultsFactor VII activity half-lifes, determined by non-compartmental and one-compartmental analysis (results in brackets), were shorter for recombinant activated (1. 4 h; 0. 7 h) than for plasma-derived <b>factor</b> VII (6. 8 h; 3. 2 h); both recombinant activated (5. 1 h; 2. 1 h and plasma-derived <b>factor</b> VII (5. 8 h; 3. 2 h) resulted in longer half-lives of <b>factor</b> VII antigen. Activated <b>factor</b> VII half-lives (based on activated <b>factor</b> VII activity levels) were significantly higher compared to <b>factor</b> VII clotting activity (1. 6 h; 0. 9 h). Volumes of distribution were significantly higher for activated <b>factor</b> VII (236 ml/kg; 175 ml/kg, measured by activated <b>factor</b> VII) as compared to plasma-derived <b>factor</b> VII (206 ml/kg; 64 ml/kg, measured by <b>factor</b> FVII activity), suggesting a plasma- and extracellular fluid distribution for recombinant activated <b>factor</b> VII.

Volumes of distribution were significantly higher for treatment with recombinant activated <b>factor</b> VII. The longer half-life for plasma-derived <b>factor</b> VII, compared to recombinant activated <b>factor</b> VII, and the increased volume of distribution for recombinant activated <b>factor</b> VII, compared to plasma-derived <b>factor</b> VII may further elucidate the beneficial effect of prophylactic treatment of both products...|$|R
