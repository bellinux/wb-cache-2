The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an update on the microbiology and epidemiology of strains of EPEC in England between 2010 and 2012. A wide range of E. coli serogroups were identified, with the most common being E. coliO 145, O 49 and O 157. Few isolates (9 %) had additional virulence factors (specifically bfp, vtx 2 f and espT genes) and the majority were classified as atypical EPEC. The majority of cases (86 %) were among children. This included a significantly higher percentage (17. 4 %) of cases aged 0 – 12 months when compared with cases of other common gastrointestinal pathogens (P, 0. 001).

40|$|Milk {{samples from}} 251 nursing mothers were {{screened}} for enterotoxigenic staphylococci. The incidence of staphylococci in milk samples was 71. 3 %. Two hundred and sixteen strains were isolated from 179 mothers. Eighty-six (39. 8 %) of the 216 strains {{were found to}} be toxigenic. Enterotoxin type A (SEA) predominated, with 41 strains (19. 0 %) elaborating it. Twenty-one strains (9. 7 %) produced enterotoxin B (SEB) while only eight (3. 7 %) produced enterotoxin C (SEC). Ten strains (4. 6 %) produced all three types. Enterotoxigenic strains usually produced coagulase, thermonuclease and alpha haemolysin. In this series breast-feeding alone was more common than combined breast and bottle feeding, especially among mothers less than 30 years old. The incidence of reported <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> decreased with increasing age of the mother. Of 16 babies with diarrhoea, 10 (62. 5 %) had mothers whose milk yielded staphylococci.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} research was to determine the causative microorganisms of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea,</b> focusing mainly on Escherichia species, and making comparative study of rest ofbacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea, as far as their identification and their reaction to different antimicrobial agents of common use. The present work methodology included the isolation, purification, identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing of bacteria which were isolated from infants suffering diarrhoea in different parts of Khartoum State, Sudan. The method adopted for native isolation and identification purposes was the culturing of faeces in differential and selective culture media such as MacConkey’s agar and Eosin Methylene Blue agar using streaking method. The purified isolates were, then, subjected for biochemical activity tests and serotyping. The results obtained revealed that, 234 isolates were collected from the 200 stool samples from infants, which were subjected to a series of purification and identification experiments. All the 234 isolates were Gram-negative rods in shape, and alone E. coliconstituted 141 of all the identified isolates. Of these isolates 34 were classified, using serotyping, as enteropathogenic E. coli, 16 as Enterotoxigenic E. coli and 12 as Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. The yield of other pathogens was, also, detected and subjected to identification tests. The tests revealed 23 isolates ofProteus, 14 isolates of Shigella spp., and 13 isolates of each of Salmonella, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas. Also Citrobacterwas represented in 12 samples in this study. Morganellawas isolated from 4 samples. Using the disc diffusion technique the clinical strains of E. coli (141), Proteus mirabilis(23), Shigella(14), Salmonella(13), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13), Pseudomonasaeruginosa (13), Citrobacter freundii(12), Morganella morganii(4), Enterobacter(1) were subjected to susceptibility tests to different antibiotics.

40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichiacoli (ETEC) is a {{major cause}} of traveller’s and <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> in {{developing}} countries, and results in considerable mortality in under 5 year olds. Disease is mediated through adhesion of ETEC cells to the intestinal brush border and the secretion of the heat-stable and/or heat-labile toxin. Whilst the toxins have been well studied it is still not clear how their expression is regulated. This work has defined binding of CRP, H-NS and σ^ 7 ^ 0 across the genome of the prototypical ETEC strain H 10407. We demonstrate a central role for all three factors in regulating pathogenicity in ETEC H 10407. Hence, we show that CRP directly regulates expression of both estA 2 and estA 1, which encode the heat-stable toxins. Furthermore, CRP indirectly represses expression of the heat-labile toxin. This work also identifies a role for CRP in controlling transcription of a small open reading frame, imbedded within a gene, at the 3 ’ end of an operon encoding a type I secretion system. ...|$|E

Out of total patients, 14877 (54. 77 %) were males and 12282 (45. 22 %) were females. As far as the distribution is concerned, 17352 patients (63. 10 %) were recorded from Rawalpindi while the remaining 9807 (36. 10 %) were from Islamabad. The highest incidence was recorded amongst the age group 0 - 12 months, with the number of diarrhoeal patients being 14936 (54. 99 %) followed by the age group 1 - 2 years where the number of patients remained 8896 (32. 75 %). The lowest incidence was recorded in the age group of 2 - 3 years where the number of patients recorded was 3327 (12. 25 %). As far as intensity of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis is concerned, out of a total of 27159 patients recorded in four years, 8573 (31. 56 %) were suffering from gastroenteritis and 18586 (68. 43 %) were suffering from diarrhoea. Breast feeding data revealed that out of the 27159 diarrhoea/ gastroenteritis patients, 11522 (42. 42 %) were breast-fed and 15637 (57. 57 %) were fed on other food. The incidence of infection in breast fed patients was low. The second part of the study involved correlating prevalence of enteropathogenic E. coli with <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> and determination of levels of antibiotic resistance amongst these isolates. For this purpose one hundred strains from diarrhoea and gastroenteritis patients falling within 0 - 3 years of age (after confirmation by biochemical and serological tests) were set aside and screened for levels of susceptibility against 13 conventional antibiotics. All isolates were 100 % resistant to ampicillin, bacitracin, penicillin and trimethoprim, while 91 % were resistant to streptomycin, 88 % were resistant to tetracycline, 69 % to chloramphenicol, 47 % to spectinomycin, 14 % to rifampicin and 0 % to amikacine and gentamicin. Whole cell protein profile analysis of these isolates was carried out to identify the genetic variability by the gel profile. The patterns were compared for variability among the whole cell protein profile by using the method of Dice (1945). Using this method of correlation, it was observed that several groups were distinguishable amongst the isolates. Such data suggest that different immunogenic groups are prevalent in our geogrpahical area...|$|E

Methods and Results: A total of 250 sewage (raw and treated) and 60 shellfish samples were collected between January 2003 and April 2007 in Monastir region, Tunisia. Group A rotavirus (RVA) was detected in 80 (32 %) sewage samples, norovirus (NoV) in 11 (4. 4 %) and enteric adenovirus (AdV) in 1 (0. 4 %). Among 60 shellfish samples collected near sewage effluents, one was contaminated by NoV (1. 6 %). Conclusion: Our data represent the first documentation in Tunisia, combining gastroenteritis viruses circulating in the environment and in clinical isolates. We observed a correlation between environmental strains and those found in children suffering from gastroenteritis during the same period study. This suggests the existence of a relationship between water contamination and paediatric diarrhoea. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our results address the potential health risks associated with transmission of human enteric viruses through water-related environmental routes. The research findings will aid in elucidating the molecular epidemiology and circulation of enteric viruses in Tunisia and in Africa, where data are rare...|$|E
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 48 – 54 The {{association}} of <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> {{with the presence}} of garbage in the environment was investigated in Canabrava, a peripheral neighbourhood of Salvador, northeast of Brazil. A cross-sectional study was conducted with all the 184 children aged less than two years residing in Canabrava, which is located close to the city garbage dump. Variables selected for study included the method used for the disposal of excrement, type of floor, mother's education, unemployment of the head of the family, regularity of the water supply, presence of toilet, storage of garbage inside the house, age, gender, duration of breastfeeding, and the number of people per room. The estimated prevalence of diarrhoea was 21. 2 %. Exposure to garbage in the environment was found {{to be the most important}} factor associated with diarrhoea (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3. 98, 95 % CI 1. 56 – 10. 13). Other important variables were the mother's education (AOR = 2. 79, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 7. 13), maternal breastfeeding (AOR = 2. 30, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 5. 04), and unemployment of the head of the family (AOR = 2. 09, 95 % CI 0. 93 – 4. 69). These findings indicate the necessity of adopting solutions in the public domain and of intersectorial policies for the reduction of diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Summary. To {{assess the}} role of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea,</b> 482 {{children}} with diarrhoea and 103 healthy controls, from three localities of Galicia, north-western Spain, were investigated between 1985 and 1988. Rotavirus (37. 3 %) and Salmonella spp. (1 2. 8 %) were the most common causal agents, followed by ETEC (3. 973, Campylobacter jejuni (2 * 3 %), Shigella spp. (0. 9 %) and Yersinia enterocolitica (0. 5 %). ETEC were significantly more frequently isolated from children with diarrhoea who were under 1 month of age (26. 5 %) than from older diarrhoeic children (2. 2 %) (p < 0. 001) or from healthy children who were under 1 month of age (0 %) (p < 0. 05). Among children who harboured ETEC, five of the nine children under 1 month of age developed diarrhoea in hospital, whereas none of the 10 children over 1 month of age did so. Seventeen ETEC isolates produced heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) only, four produced only heat-labile enterotoxin (LT), and two produced both toxins. Colonisation factor antigens CFA/I and CFA/II were detected in 11 (55. 0 %) of the 20 ETEC isolates that remained enterotoxigenic after maintenance in the laboratory. Most ETEC isolates belonged to serotypes 0 1 53 : K-: H 45 (nine STa ' CFA/I + isolates) ...|$|E
40|$|Rotavirus is a {{major cause}} of acute <b>infantile</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> worldwide. The virus genome {{consists}} of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that codesfor six structural proteins (VP 1 - 6) and six non-structural proteins(NSP 1 - 6). NSPs are proteins expressed from the virus genome in the infected cell, but are not incorporated into the mature virus article. NSPs play an essential role in virus replication, morphogenesis and pathogenesis, and most of them exhibit multifunctional properties. Structure-function analysis of the NSPs is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the virus circumvents host innate immune responses, inhibits cellular protein synthesis, hijacks the protein synthetic machinery for its own propagation and manifests the disease process. Because of their essential roles in virus biology, NSPs represent potential targets for the development of antiviral agents. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of NSPs has been hindered due to low-level expression and aggregation. To date, the complete three-dimensional structure of only NSP 2 has been determined. The structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of NSP 3 and the diarrhoea-inducing domain of NSP 4 have also been determined. This review primarily covers the structural and biological functions of the NSPs whose three-dimensional structural aspects have been fully or partially understood, but provides a brief account of other NSPs and the structural features of the mature virion as determined by electron cryomicroscopy...|$|E
