Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E

He then beat Rae and strangled her to death in an alleyway. [...] Barlow said that because Hollyoaks Later is broadcast late at night, there were no limits to the storyline, allowing the producers to [...] "do whatever they wanted with it." [...] She described Rae's death scene as [...] "absolutely incredible" [...] and loved {{the chance to work}} with accredited actor Rawle. She explained that Rae's death had been kept secret in order to shock viewers in the same way the death of Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) had previously done. Barlow said she was happy and grateful with the nature of her exit storyline, as the opportunity to [...] "go out with a bang" [...] was better than Rae leaving quietly in a taxi. She hoped that Rae's murder would [...] "go down in Hollyoaks history" [...] {{as one of the best}} exits. In the aftermath, Brendan was arrested for Rae's murder after Silas planted evidence on him. Barlow stated that other characters blamed Brendan because he had caused Rae to fear for her life, and that Ste believed he was culpable because [...] "fter all the ups and downs, Ste knows exactly what the relationship between Rae and Brendan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> and all the problems they've had." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

One UN official claimed that while Ban would greet world leaders in their native language, he would then read directly from his talking points without small talk. The UN official opined, [...] "Quiet diplomacy? He [...] displayed no skills for that.” South African lawyer Nicholas Haysom also defended Ban, saying that the news media [...] "caricatured [...] as invisible when he made outspoken comments that the media then failed to report".|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{said several}} of the tracks are songs that he held onto before he was signed. He said they were too good to give away on mixtapes. Cole stated that he had 16 tracks on the album, 12 of which he has {{produced}} himself. He also revealed {{that he would not}} release a pre-album mixtape like he previously stated. Instead, every Sunday until the album he released songs that did not make the album. The bundles of songs released are called Any Given Sundays.

HRW noted that Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India, saw a parallel between the apartheid system and untouchability. Eleanor Zelliot also notes Singh's 2006 comment but says that, despite the obvious similarities, race prejudice and the situation of Dalits [...] "have a different basis and perhaps a different solution." [...] Though the Indian Constitution abolished untouchability, the oppressed status of Dalits remains a reality. In rural India, stated Klaus Klostermaier in 2010, [...] "they still live in secluded quarters, do the dirtiest work, and {{are not allowed to}} use the village well and other common facilities". In the same year, Zelliot noted that [...] "In spite of much progress over the last sixty years, Dalits are still at the social and economic bottom of society." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Stewart made a short video against {{domestic}} violence for Amnesty International, {{in which he}} recollected his father's physical attacks on his mother and the effect it had on him as a child. For instance, he said, [...] "the physical harm... a shocking pain. But there are other aspects of violence which have more lasting impact psychologically on family members. It is destructive and tainting. As a child witnessing these events, one cannot simply help somehow feeling responsible for them; for the pain, and the screaming, and the misery." [...] In the same year, he gave his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he is Chancellor, to fund post-graduate study into {{domestic violence}}. Stewart's childhood experience also led {{him to become a}} patron of Refuge, a UK charity for abused women. In 2009, Stewart gave a speech at the launch of Created Equal, a book about women's rights, talking again about his personal experiences with domestic violence and the impacts they had on him. He remarked, [...] "violence is a choice and it's a choice a man makes...the lasting impact on my mother...and indeed on myself...was extreme. Overcoming the lessons of that male stereotype that I was being shown was a struggle." [...] He now hopes to set an example of [...] "what it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> to be in an environment of such violence and that it can pass and that one can survive it and even though sometimes still a struggle." [...] Additionally, in October 2011, he presented a BBC Lifeline Appeal on behalf of Refuge, discussing his own experience of domestic violence and interviewing a woman whose daughter was murdered by her ex-husband.|$|E
