40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{effects of}} reference pricing {{for prescription drugs}} in German social health insurance based on econometric panel data methods. We analyze the effect on <b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices.</b> Moreover, we investigate whether manufacturers adapt prices of their products not subject to reference pricing {{as a consequence of}} changes in reference prices of their products subject to reference pricing. We use a large panel data set of nearly all German prescription drugs on a monthly basis between October 1994 and July 2005. Altogether, the data comprise almost 4 million observations. They provide information on <b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices,</b> reference prices, manufacturers, type of prescription drug, and market entries and exits. Our results show that there is no full price adjustment:A 1 %-change in reference prices leads to a 0. 3 %-change in market prices. Price adjustment, however, is fast, it mostly happens in the first month. Furthermore, the first introduction of a reference price reduces market prices of the affected products by approximately 14 %. Finally, we observe a significant time effect which is positive in the market without reference prices and negative in that with reference price.

50|$|As {{promising}} as {{the future}} is for a whole, the outlook for small and medium enterprises (SME) is not as bright. The excise structure changed so that companies now {{have to pay a}} 16% tax on the maximum retail price (MRP) of their products, as opposed to on the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price.</b> Consequently, larger companies cut back on outsourcing and what business is left shifted to companies with facilities in the four tax-free states - Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttaranchal, and Jharkhand. Consequently, a large number of pharmaceutical manufacturers shifted their plant to these states, as it became almost impossible to continue operating in non-tax free zones. But in a matter of a couple of years the excise duty was revised on two occasions, first it was reduced to 8% and then to 4%. As a result, the benefits of shifting to a tax free zone was negated. This resulted in, factories in the tax free zones, to start up third party manufacturing. Under this these factories produced goods under the brand names of other parties on job work basis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{prices of}} medicines, both originators and generics, in New Zealand and 16 European {{countries}}. MethodsEx-factory price data as of December 2012 from New Zealand and 16 European countries were compared for {{a basket of}} 14 medicines, {{most of which were}} at least partially funded by the state in the 17 countries. Five medicines had, at least in some countries, generic versions on the market whose prices were also analyzed. Medicine price data for the 16 European countries were provided by the Pharma Price Information service. New Zealand medicine prices were retrieved from the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule. Unit prices converted into euro were compared at the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> level. ResultsFor the 14 medicines surveyed, considerable price differences at the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> level were identified. Within the European countries, prices in Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Spain ranked at the lower end, whereas prices in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were at the upper end. The results for New Zealand compared with Europe were variable. New Zealand prices were found in the lowest quartile for five medicines and in the highest quartile for seven other products. Price differences between the originator products and generic versions ranged from 0 % to 90 % depending on the medicine and the country. ConclusionsMedicine prices varied considerably between European countries and New Zealand as well as among the European countries.

30|$|The {{variables}} {{in this paper}} are as follows: Output (Y, 0.1 Billion Yuan) {{is measured by the}} industrial value-added; Capital (K, 0.1 Billion Yuan) is a stock variable and is measured by the annual average net value of fixed assets; Labor (L, 10 thousand employees) is measured by the average annual number of employees. The values of the domestic enterprise variables (Y_it^D, K_it^D, L_it^D) are calculated by subtracting the values of the three types of foreign-invested enterprises (Y_it^F, K_it^F, L_it^F) from the values of all state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises above the designated size industrial enterprises. This paper adopts the sum of foreign capital and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions’ capital to measure the main variable of foreign direct investment (FDI, 0.1 Billion Yuan); R&D (R&D, 0.1 Billion Yuan) is measured by the R&D funds of domestic enterprises. The original data above are determined by the current price for each year. To eliminate the price impact and obtain the real values, output is deflated by the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> index of industrial goods; furthermore, capital, FDI and R&D are deflated by the price index of investment in fixed assets.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveOur {{objective}} is to review and assess the main pharmaceutical cost-containment policies used in Ireland in recent years, and to highlight how a policy that improved fiscal sustainability but worsened economic sustainability could have improved both if an option-based approach was implemented. MethodThe main public pharmaceutical cost-containment policy measures including reducing the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> of drugs, pharmacy dispensing fees and community drug scheme coverage, and increasing patient copayments are outlined along with the resulting savings. We quantify the cost implications of a new policy that restricts the entitlement to free prescription drugs of persons older than 70 years and propose an alternative option-based policy that reduces the total cost to {{both the state and}} the patient. ResultsThis set of policy measures reduced public spending on community drugs by an estimated € 380 m in 2011. The policy restricting free prescription drugs for persons older than 70 years, though effective in reducing public cost, increased the total cost of the drugs supplied. The policy-induced cost increase stems from a fees anomaly between the two main community drugs schemes which is circumvented by our alternative option-based policy. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the need for policymakers, even when absorbed with reducing cost, to design cost-containment policies that are both fiscally and economically sustainable...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the performance of}} the Brazilian aerospace industry with that of the world leader in aerospace production, the USA, requires appropriate conversion rates. Following the methodology of the International Comparisons of Output and Productivity project (ICOP), we calculate unit value ratios for the aerospace industry based on <b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices.</b> So far no comparisons have been made for this sector, due to problems of disclosure in national statistics. In this paper, we have made adjustments to official data from industrial surveys using supplementary data on quantities and prices from a variety of other sources. Our 2005 unit value ratios for the aerospace industry are somewhat lower than updated UVRs from a previous ICOP study by Mulder et al (2002) for the whole transport equipment branch, but the two estimates are in the same range. Our results on comparative labour productivity in aerospace point to more rapid catch up than in the transport sector as a whole. There was a period between 1999 and 2003, when the Brazilian aerospace industry clearly outperformed the United States. However, Brazil was unable to sustain this dramatic sectoral catch up. After 2003, firms disregarded the clear signals of shrinking value added and continued {{to increase the number of}} employees. As a result Brazil once again fell behind.

40|$|Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 2 (DM 2) {{is one of}} {{the main}} sociosanitary problems; there are many treatments for it. Recently, it has been approved the first drug of a new family of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) : dapagliflozin. We aimed to review the available scientific evidence on dapagliflozin, in order to analyze its effectiveness, safety and cost and to estimate its role in the current pharmacotherapy of DM 2. Methods: Effectiveness and safety of dapagliflozin were analyzed by an evaluation of the scientific evidence. The cost of different OHA was calculated based on the defined daily dose (DDD) and their <b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices.</b> Results: Seven randomized clinical trials were identified: 2 monotherapy (840 patients) and 5 in combination with other hypoglycemic agents (3184 patients). In the seven trials, dapagliflozin reduced HbA 1 c; all were compared with placebo, unless in a trial of combination therapy in which was compared with an active drug (glipizide). The most common side effects were genitourinary infections and hypotension, although it should be taken into consideration the increase of the bladder cancer. Besides the DPP- 4 inhibitors, dapagliflozin {{is one of the}} OHA more expensive (annual cost of DDD= 729. 3 euros). Conclusions: Dapagliflozin does not provide advantages over pharmacotherapy for DM 2.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} reduce/prevent {{combination}} Anti-Retroviral Therapy (cART) -related toxicity, while maintaining its therapeutic effectiveness over time, the optimization of the antiretroviral therapy could be performed. AIM: To estimate {{the economic impact}} on the Italian National Health Service (NHS) of a cART optimization pathway as maintenance therapy in HIV- 1 infected patients over one-year period. METHODS: Patient data were retrieved from the electronic medical record system in use (year 2015) in a reference HIV Center in Northern Italy. The analysis considered naïve patients and non-naïve patients. To estimate the actual ART expenditure charged to the Center we calculated the cost of cART received during 12 months for each patient. Subsequently, referring to the same patients, a "potential" cART expenditure was estimated. This potential expenditure was estimated taking in consideration {{the adoption of a}} specific optimization pathway aimed at maintaining over the time the cART efficacy. Lastly, to assess the sustainability of the optimization pathway, we compared the actual cART expenditure with the potential one. We considered only drug costs (<b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices,</b> included all discounts and VAT) {{from the perspective of the}} Italian NHS. RESULTS: In the 2015, the total expenditure for 564 enrolled HIV- 1 patients treated with cART was € 4, 042, 983. The mean treatment cost per patient was € 7, 168. If the Center adopted a specific optimization pathway, the total expenditure would be € 3, 914, 855 (€ - 128, 128). CONCLUSIONS: From the Italian NHS’s perspective, the adoption of a specific cART optimization pathway represents a cost-saving option as maintenance antiretroviral therapy in HIV- 1 infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To compare {{prices of}} in-patent active {{ingredients}} (AIs) in Europe at three levels (ex-factory prices, net distribution margins and third party payers' prices). Methods We compared the prices in seven EU countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK) of the 20 in-patent AIs most {{sold on the}} Italian retail market in 2004, based on "sell in" sales data. We calculated the average <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> per unit of each compound {{in each of the}} seven countries, weighted by the volumes of all reimbursable package sizes and strengths. We estimated net distribution margins according to the 2004 domestic regulations by deducting any type of mandatory discount. Finally, we added VAT to calculate "third party payer's prices". All prices were expressed in index numbers (ItalyÂ =Â  100). Results Italy had the lowest average ex-factory prices, the Netherlands and particularly the UK had by far the lowest distribution margins, while Germany had by far the highest third party payers' prices. The Netherlands and particularly UK showed a steep decrease from ex-factory to third party payers' prices, while Belgium, Italy and Spain gave the opposite pattern. Conclusions Our study suggests that public authorities can deal with drug prices both by strictly controlling ex-factory prices and by establishing appropriate distribution margins. The latter might be facilitated by liberalizing the distribution sector. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{describe}} pharmaceutical {{pricing and}} reimbursement systems in 29 European countries {{with regard to}} medicines, particularly generics, and their possible impact on generics uptake. Method: Data collection on pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement policies with the staff of competent authorities. Results: In most European countries the prices of medicines are controlled at the stage of manufacture (<b>ex-factory</b> <b>price)</b> or wholesale. Usually, price control systems target reimbursable medicines, and the prices of reimbursable generics are regulated. Sixteen of the 29 countries surveyed in this study apply a policy of generic price linkage, i. e. setting {{the price of the}} generic medicines at a specific percentage lower than that of the originator. Twenty-two of the surveyed countries run a reference price system, i. e. a reimbursement policy based on clusters of identical or similar medicines for which a fixed amount of reimbursement is granted. Most countries cluster medicines with the same active ingredient, and only a few countries have opted for broader reference groups, thus allowing more interchangeability between choice of medicines and higher savings on costs. Demand-side measures such as generics substitution and/or prescribing by the international non-proprietary name are in place in nearly all the countries surveyed. These are usually not mandatory for the stakeholders concerned. Conclusion: As many pharmaceutical policies tend to address reimbursable medicines, generics fall under the scope of these measures. European countries apply a mix of specific measures to promote generics uptake. There appears to be room for improvement regarding the enforcement of some policies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recently Fisher-Vanden et al (2004) {{have used}} firm level data to {{estimate}} an energy intensity function {{for a large}} number of enterprises in China. This is the first study to use the regression approach to examining the relationships between fuel prices and fuel consumption in China. One of the major findings of the study is that firms are very responsive to relative fuel price changes. However, as the authors acknowledged, the data set is comprised of only sampled enterprises and the time frame is too short to examine firms ’ dynamic behaviour. The present paper aims to model fuel demand behaviours in China using longer data series at the sectoral level. Unlike the Fisher-Vanden et al study, fuel price data for the present study are first estimated using China’s input-output tables and industrial <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> indices. Then, using annual data on total fuel consumption by sector for the period 1985 - 2000, the study investigates how sectors respond to changes in the relative prices of various fuels. Four sectors in the Chinese economy are selected for the study, namely, the chemical industry, the metal industry, the non-metal materials industry and the residential sector, which are top energy as well as top coal consumers. Five fuels are considered, namely, coal, crude oil, electricity, natural gas and petroleum products, which accounted for nearly all of the total energy consumption {{in each of the four}} sectors. A translog demand system is estimated for each sector using the seemingly unrelated regression method. The results suggest that significant substitutions away from coal to alternative fuels take place in the residential as well as the metal sectors...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to examine}} the impact of {{external}} price referencing (EPR) on on-patent medicine prices, adjusting for other factors that may affect price levels such as sales volume, exchange rates, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, total pharmaceutical expenditure (TPE), and size of the pharmaceutical industry. Methods: Price data of 14 on-patent products, in 14 European countries in 2007 and 2008 were obtained from the Pharmaceutical Price Information Service of the Austrian Health Institute. Based on the unit <b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices</b> in EURO, scaled ranks per country and per product were calculated. For the regression analysis the scaled ranks per country and product were weighted; each country had the same sum of weights but within a country the weights were proportional to its sales volume in the year (data obtained from IMS Health). Taking the scaled ranks, several statistical analyses were performed by using the program “R”, including a multiple regression analysis (including variables such as GDP per capita and national industry size). Results: This study showed that on average EPR as a pricing policy leads to lower prices. However, the large variation in price levels among countries using EPR confirmed that the price level is not only driven by EPR. The unadjusted linear regression model confirms that applying EPR in a country is associated with a lower scaled weighted rank (p= 0. 002). This interaction persisted after inclusion of total pharmaceutical expenditure per capita and GDP per capita in the final model. Conclusions: The study showed that for patented products, prices are in general lower in case the country applied EPR. Nevertheles...|$|R
40|$|Budget impact {{analysis}} in the maintenance raltegravir-containing regimen in virologically suppressed HIV infected patientsBackgroundA one-year cost analysis was conducted to estimate the impact {{from the perspective of}} the Italian National Health Service (NHS) of nevirapine or etravirine or rilpivirine plus raltegravir administration as maintenance antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed HIV- 1 infected patients. MethodsPatient data were retrieved from the electronic medical record system in use (year 2016) in a reference HIV centre in South Italy. The analysis considered patients with long-term (more than 1 year) virological suppression (HIV- 1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and no prior exposure to integrase inhibitors (INIs). To estimate the total HAART expenditure, we calculated the annual treatment cost for each enrolled patient. Subsequently, to estimate the dual therapy hypothetical expenditure, we assumed to treat the same patients with nevirapine or rilpivirine or etravirine and raltegravir. We took into account only drug costs (<b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices,</b> included all discounts and VAT) {{from the perspective of the}} Italian NHS. ResultsIn 2016, the total expenditure for the 116 enrolled HIV- 1 infected patients treated with HAART was € 869, 889. The mean treatment cost per patient was € 7, 499. If all patients were treated with the dual therapy (nevirapine/raltegravir), the total expenditure would be € 641, 016 (- 26. 3 %) with a mean treatment cost per patient of € 5, 526 and a potential total saving of € 228, 873. On the contrary, the dual regimen based on etravirine or rilpivirine associated with raltegravir would engender respectively a 35. 5 % and 8. 7 % expenditure increase. ConclusionsFrom the Italian NHS perspective, nevirapine/raltegravir represent a cost-saving option as maintenance antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed HIV- 1 infected patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{survey the}} price {{differences}} between originators and generics for a selected basket of molecules and to analyze {{similarities and differences}} {{with regard to the}} countries included and their generic policies. METHODS: <b>Ex-factory</b> <b>prices</b> as of November 2011 of five molecules provided from the Pharma Price Information (PPI) service of the Austrian Health Institute were analyzed for 16 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, UK). The selected molecules were gemcitabine, mycophenolate mofetil, olanzapine, risperidone and sumatriptan. For a specific presentation (same pack size, dosage and pharmaceutical form) of each molecule, the prices of the original product and the “most common generic” as defined by PPI were compared. RESULTS: Considerable variations among the extent of price differences between originator and generic were identified (gemicitabine: lowest price difference of 1. 4 % between originator and generic in Belgium and highest difference of 73. 4 % in Portugal; mycophenolate mofetil: 3. 4 % Norway – 71. 7 % Netherlands; olanzapine: 0. 1 % Spain – 97. 1 % Sweden; risperidone: 0. 9 % Netherlands – 97. 3 % UK; sumatriptan: 5. 8 % Greece – 95. 0 % Denmark). Further, no difference at all between originator and generic prices was found for some molecules in a few countries (Norway: for 4 of the 5 molecules analyzed; Spain: 3; Belgium: 2; in Austria, France and Greece for one molecule respectively). For the five molecules of the sample, Greece, Spain, Ireland and Norway consistently displayed lower price differences whereas Denmark, Finland and Sweden tended to show higher differences between originator and generic prices. CONCLUSION: Even if this research is illustrative and not representative due to the small sample size, results suggest confirming large differences across Europe. It appears that countries (e. g. Denmark, Sweden) with strong generic policies, particularly based on competition and involving elements of enforcement, tend to have higher differences between originator and generic prices. Further research, notably with a broader basket, is recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{medicines}} pricing procedure in the Republic of Macedonia OBJECTIVES: To analyze the development in {{the medicines}} pricing regulation in Republic of Macedonia during 2005 - 2010 {{and its impact on}} medicines affordability. METHODS: Regulatory analysis of the changes in the medicines prices regulation for the period 2005 - 2010 was applied. The affordability of the medicines to the population was explored before the after the new regulation introduction. Affordability was evaluated through the comparison of the cost of therapy of the most frequent diseases with the inhabitants wages. For comparison purposes, the average monthly wages in January 2005 (7. 999, 00 MKD) and in January 2010 (14. 914, 00 MKD) were used as announced by the UJP (Public Revenue Office of Macedonia). The statistical test used was Wilcoxon Matched Pais Test. RESULTS: The unified medicines prices were established in 2007 based on <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price,</b> wholesale mark-ups and pharmacy mark-ups. The Health Insurance Fund carried out the supply of medicines on the Positive list by international tenders until 2005. The reference pricing was introduced in 2007 and it took into consideration the Purchasing Parity Power. The statistical analysis of the cost of treatment for selected health conditions compared with the average monthly wages, expressed as working hours shows that less working hours are needed to purchase medicines for all clinical conditions in 2010 compared to 2005. There is statistically significant difference in the working hours needed to purchase medicines between 2010 and 2005 (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test: Z = 2, 240, p = 0, 0250). The better financial affordability of medicines in 2010 is a result of partly lower medicines prices, but predominantly a result of higher monthly wages. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis reveals the positive impact of medicines price control and reference pricing on medicines affordability. The number of working hours needed to purchase a month of treatment decreased. ...|$|E
40|$|An earlier project, TCP/URT/ 4515, {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} the i rrigated state farms operated by the National Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO), and made several recommendations for rehabilitation and improvements in management. Howe ver, an evaluation had yet to be carried out of the performance and constraints of the s ugar estates {{under the control of the}} Sugar Development Corporation (SUDECO). FAO assistance was therefore requested for reporting on the status of the implementation of those e arlier recommendations, and for recommending investment priorities for the irrigated st ate farms and the sugar estatesThe consultancy mission fielded by the project carried out site stud ies on four rice farms, one fodder and dairy farm, and four sugar estates. The mission foun d that all NAFCO farms and SUDECO sugar estates were operating well below their potential production levels: on the farms studied, rice production was 15 446 tons of pad dy, compared with a potential yield of 36 750 tons; the average output of the sugar estates had been about 50 percent of capacityWith respect to the NAFCO farms, the problems have arisen partly bec ause there was a shortage not only of local funds - because high production costs lea ve small profit margins -but also of the foreign exchange needed to maintain and replace essenti al farm equipment for irrigation and cropping systems. Further, although the management and accounting staff were well trained and experienced, the weak organizational stru cture and management system prevent effective management and budget control, and staff mor ale was low. The use of impure rice seed on the farms increased crop losses by an estim ated 5 percent to 8 percent of the final productVery few of the recommendations of the earlier project had been impl emented. Those recommendations were still fully endorsed, with a number of additions and amplifications. Management and organizational systems should be restructured so that individual farm general managers are answerable to the NAFCO Board of Directors. The local Boards of Directors should be transformed into advisory committees. The recommended investment priorities for rehabilitation included the replacement of out-dated equipment and farm machinery, and the purchase of spare parts; the establishmen t of a new rice seed multiplication farm; and training and incentive schemes to improve st aff morale. The estimated initial funding required was $US 4 to 5 million. To reduce the de pendence on foreign assistance, consideration should be given to a land-lease scheme for sma llholder farmers on some of the NAFCO rice farmsThe SUDECO sugar estates also suffered from a shortage of local fund s and foreign exchange which prevented the purchase of spare parts and replacement of capital items. All sugar produced by the estates was marketed through SUDECO. The ex-f actory price of sugar was adjusted annually to compensate for inflation, but in general it trailed two years behind the real needs of the estates. The over-riding reason for the low production by the sugar estates was the small profit margin allowed to them. To enable the es tates to generate sufficient cash to operate and secure the foreign exchange they need, i t was recommended that the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> of sugar be increased: at the moment, a 2 5 percent rise in the <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price</b> would be realistic. At Mtibwa and Kilombero, serio us shortages of outgrower cane would prevent the factories from reaching full production, and it was therefore important that the estates commit themselves more firmly to collecting and processing such cane. In addition, the price paid to farmers should be increase d to attract new growersThere was a high rate of turnover of medium-level technical staff in the estates' factories and workshops. It was recommended that additional training facilities be established, and incentive payments introduce...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Orphan {{drugs have}} been a {{highlight}} of discussions due to their higher prices than non-orphan drugs. There is currently no European consensus on the method of value assessment for orphan drugs. This study assessed {{the relationship between the}} prevalence of rare diseases and the annual treatment cost of orphan drugs in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and UK. Methods: Approved orphan drugs and prevalence data were extracted from the European Medicines Agency website. Annual treatment costs were calculated using <b>ex-factory</b> <b>price.</b> Simple regression was used to analyse the relationship between costs and prevalence. A specific bivariate analysis was performed for the rarest diseases (≤ 1 per 10, 000). Results: 120 drugs were analysed. Prevalence ranged from 0. 001 to 5 per 10, 000 (mean 1. 24, median 1). Annual treatment costs per patient ranged from € 755 to € 1, 051, 956 (mean € 100, 000, median € 39, 303). Results show a statistically significant inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and disease prevalence in all countries (France: r = - 0. 370, p = 0. 002; Germany: r = - 0. 365, p = 0. 002; Italy: r = - 0. 340, p = 0. 002; Spain: r = - 0. 316, p = 0. 041; UK: r = - 0. 358, p = 0. 0004; Sweden: r = - 0. 414, p = 0. 014; Norway: r = - 0. 367, p = 0. 002). When analysis was focused on the rarest diseases, a stronger correlation exists in all countries (France: r = - 0. 525, Germany: r = - 0. 482, Italy: r = - 0. 497, Spain: r = - 0. 531, UK: r = - 0. 436, Sweden: r = - 0. 455, Norway: r = - 0. 466; all p < 0. 05 except Sweden p = 0. 077). Conclusions: This study shows an inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and prevalence with high statistical significance in the studied countries. Although pricing is a complex process where different attributes are assessed, this study supports the idea that payers value rarity in pricing decisions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Follicular {{lymphoma}} (FL) is {{the second}} most common type of lymphoid cancer in Western Europe. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the cost utility of rituximab-bendamustine treatment compared with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) treatment as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced FL in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of rituximab-bendamustine compared with R-CHOP as first-line treatment for patients with advanced FL in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Transitions between health states (progression-free, including induction and maintenance; first relapse; second relapse; and death) were allowed for the patient cohort in 4 -week-long cycles. Clinical data for the extrapolation of progression-free survival curves were obtained from randomized trials. Mortality rates and utilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs (€, 2013) included drug costs (<b>ex-factory</b> <b>prices</b> with mandatory deductions), disease management costs and adverse event-associated costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % annual rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using 10, 000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess the model robustness. RESULTS: Treatment and administration costs during the induction phase were higher for rituximab-bendamustine (€ 17, 671) than for R-CHOP (€ 11, 850). At the end of the 25 -year period, the rituximab-bendamustine first-line strategy had a total cost of € 68, 357 compared with € 69, 528 for R-CHOP. Health benefits were higher for rituximab-bendamustine treatment (10. 31 QALYs) than for R-CHOP treatment (9. 82 QALYs). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab-bendamustine was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP in 53. 4 % of the simulations. CONCLUSION: First-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine in FL patients was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP; it showed cost savings and higher health benefits for the Spanish NHS.

40|$|Cost {{analysis}} of residual viremia detected by two real-time PCR assays for response-guided (dual or triple) therapy of HCV genotype 1 infectionIntroductionThe duration of interferon-based dual and triple therapies for HCV-G 1 {{is determined by}} assessment of early viral kinetics. We conducted a cost analysis to determine the mean cost of dual or triple therapy treatment for a patient with HCV-G 1, where the therapy duration (24 or 48 weeks) is guided by HCV-RNA assay. MethodsHCV-RNA was assessed by two widely used real-time PCR-based assays, Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan (CAP-CTM) and Real-Time HCV (ART). As far as the dual therapy (PegINFα- 2 b and RBV) is concerned, at week 12 of treatment 16. 0 % of patients (27 / 169) were eligible to receive a shorter duration of therapy (24 weeks) according to CAP-CTM and 8. 9 % (15 / 169) according to ART: 26 patients achieved SVR (15. 4 %) with CAP-CTM and 15 with ART (8. 9 %). With regard to triple therapy (TPV, PegINFα- 2 a and RBV), at week 12 of treatment 59. 6 % of patients (31 / 52) were eligible to receive a shorter duration of therapy (24 weeks) according to CAP-CTM and 28. 8 % (15 / 52) according to ART: 30 patients achieved SVR (57. 7 %) with CAP-CTM and 13 with ART (25. 0 %). The cost analysis was conducted {{from the perspective of}} the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Only drug (TPV, PegINFα- 2 a, PegINFα- 2 b and RBV) and test (CAP-CTM and ART) costs were taken into account. <b>Ex-factory</b> <b>prices</b> (included all discounts) and national tariffs were used to calculate drug consumptions and tests, respectively. Costs were assessed in Euros 2015. ResultsWith regard to dual therapy, the overall mean treatment cost per patient with CAP-CTM (€ 9, 572. 77) was lower than with ART (€ 9, 876. 19). With regard to triple therapy, the overall mean treatment cost per patient was lower with CAP-CTM (€ 31, 354. 40) than with ART (€ 33, 155. 26). ConclusionsCAP-CTM HCV-RNA assay was cost-saving from the Italian NHS perspective compared with ART HCV-RNA assay in the dual (-€ 303. 42 per patient) and triple (-€ 1, 800. 96 per patient) HCV therapy...|$|R
40|$|Budget impact {{analysis}} of ticagrelor for preventive treatment {{of patients with}} acute coronary syndromesBackgroundTicagrelor 90 mg BID is indicated {{for the prevention of}} thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Outcomes from the PLATO trial demonstrated that ticagrelor + ASA reduced the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to clopidogrel + ASA. ObjectiveThis analysis estimated the budget impact of the use of ticagrelor and clopidogrel for the prevention of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with ACS in Italy, based on the PLATO trial results. MethodsA budget-impact model (BIM) was developed to estimate the direct costs up to 12 months after an ACS event from the Italian NHS perspective. Resource utilization (drugs, screening, monitoring, hospitalizations and transfusions) was derived from the PLATO trial. Only direct medical costs were considered. <b>Ex-factory</b> <b>prices</b> (including all discounts) and National Tariffs were used to estimate the costs of drugs and medical resource, respectively. The BIM showed the difference in expenditure and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death – PLATO trial) generated by the base case as calculated for current prescription volumes (ticagrelor 50. 6 %, clopidogrel 49. 4 %), and for different prescription volume scenarios (ticagrelor at 75 % and 100 %). Key variables were tested in the sensitivity analysis. ResultsTicagrelor was associated with a medical cost offset driven by fewer hospitalizations; this partly offsets the incremental drug cost and results in an annual incremental cost per patient of € 32. 53 (€ 11, 526. 03 for ticagrelor and € 11, 493. 50 for clopidogrel). Based on data from the PLATO trial, the incidence of ACS and current prescription volumes in Italy, the BIM predicts that the total number of cardiovascular events and costs are 6, 169 and € 652. 3 M, respectively. The BIM predicts that ticagrelor is associated with 550 fewer cardiovascular events at an incremental cost of € 8. 8 M compared to generic clopidogrel. The impact of total annual costs for the Italian NHS would be limited if ticagrelor prescription volumes would be higher. The total cost is predicted to increase by 0. 07 % if ticagrelor prescription goes up to 75 %, while the reduction of cardiovascular events is estimated to be considerably lower than - 4. 9 %. ConclusionsUtilization of ticagrelor, as an alternative to generic clopidogrel to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with ACS, could represent an effective, low-cost treatment option for the Italian NHS...|$|R
