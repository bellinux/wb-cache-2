These defects are especially obvious in a small-sized dataset. To avoid the complicated treatment of PRs based metrics, we propose two new indicators - the citation-based indicator (CBI) and the combined impact indicator (CII). <b>Document</b> types <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> are taken into account. With the two indicators, one would no more be bothered by complex issues encountered by PRs based indicators.
