5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract.|$|E
50|$|Bidirectional {{transducers}} convert physical phenomena to <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> {{and also}} convert <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> into physical phenomena. Examples of inherently bidirectional transducers are antennae, which can convert conducted <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> {{to or from}} propagating electromagnetic waves, and voice coils, which convert <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> into sound (when used in a loudspeaker) or sound into <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> (when used in a microphone). Likewise, DC electric motors {{may be used to}} generate electrical power if the motor shaft is turned by an external torque.|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic {{transducers}} {{are divided}} into three broad categories: transmitters, receivers and transceivers. Transmitters convert <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> into ultrasound, receivers convert ultrasound into <b>electrical</b> <b>signals,</b> and transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound.|$|R
50|$|Advancements in {{technology}} {{within the past}} fifteen years have created multiple forms of electroanalgesia. Doctors can target specific <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> caused by pain and cancel them out using <b>electrical</b> <b>signals,</b> optimally with alternating low and high frequencies.|$|R
5|$|Among {{its other}} uses, in 1880, {{measurements}} {{from the site}} were used {{as part of the}} effort to develop standard time. The observatory remained the official timekeeper for Canada until 1905, when that responsibility was transferred to Ottawa's Dominion Observatory. At exactly 11:55am the clocks in Toronto fire halls were rung by an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> from the Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, {{which is exactly what}} a transponder is. A transponder can be made up of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> and the second transceiver converting the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E
5000|$|DSLAM: {{a device}} for DSL service. The DSLAM port where the {{subscriber}} local loop is connected converts analog <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> to data traffic (upstream traffic for data upload) and data traffic to analog <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> (downstream for data download).|$|R

25|$|Some neurons do not {{generate}} action potentials, {{but instead}} generate a graded <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> {{which in turn}} causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such nonspiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{membrane}} of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels {{that allow the}} neuron to generate and propagate an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (an action potential). These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), and calcium (Ca2+).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E

25|$|Other {{instruments}} {{convert the}} results of their measurements to a repetitive <b>electrical</b> <b>signal,</b> and incorporate an oscilloscope as a display element. Such complex measurement systems include spectrum analyzers, transistor analyzers, and time domain reflectometers (TDRs). Unlike an oscilloscope, these instruments automatically generate stimulus or sweep a measurement parameter.|$|E
25|$|Neurons {{communicate}} by chemical and electrical synapses {{in a process}} known as neurotransmission, also called synaptic transmission. The fundamental process that triggers the release of neurotransmitters is the action potential, a propagating <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> that is generated by exploiting the electrically excitable membrane of the neuron. This is also known as a wave of depolarization.|$|E
25|$|All class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit piezoelectricity, {{and have}} a piezoelectric effect called microphonics, microphony or in audio applications squealing. Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> which in many cases is undesired noise. Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.|$|E

40|$|In an ellipsometer, a phase-modulated, {{polarized}} light beam {{is applied to}} a sample, <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> are obtained representing the orthogonal planes of polarization of the light after it has interacted with the sample and the constants of the sample are calculated from the two resulting <b>electrical</b> <b>signals.</b> The phase modulation is sufficiently small so that the calibration errors are negligible. For this purpose, the phase modulator phase modulates the light within a range {{of no more than}} ten degrees modulations peak to peak. The two <b>electrical</b> <b>signals</b> are expanded by Fourier analysis and the coefficients thereof utilized to calculate psi and delta...|$|R
25|$|Gradually, {{electrical}} reproduction {{entered the}} home. The spring motor {{was replaced by}} an electric motor. The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm was replaced by an electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> The tone arm now served to conduct a pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn was replaced by an amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|For many sensing techniques, {{the sensor}} {{can act as}} both a sensor and an actuator– often the term {{transducer}} is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitive}} transducer {{element of}} a microphone is called its element or capsule. Sound is first converted to mechanical motion {{by means of a}} diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal.</b> A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A wireless microphone contains a radio transmitter.|$|E

25|$|Oscilloscopes {{are used}} to observe the change of an <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> over time, such that voltage and time {{describe}} a shape which is continuously graphed against a calibrated scale. The observed waveform can be analyzed for such properties as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|All {{ferroelectric}} materials exhibit piezoelectricity a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> (noise). The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
25|$|The axon of an α-MN {{connects with}} its extrafusal muscle fiber via a neuromuscular junction, a {{specialized}} type of chemical synapse that differs both in {{structure and function}} from the chemical synapses that connect neurons to each other. Both types of synapses rely on neurotransmitters to transduce the <b>electrical</b> <b>signal</b> into a chemical signal and back. One way they differ is that synapses between neurons typically use glutamate or GABA as their neurotransmitters, while the neuromuscular junction uses acetylcholine exclusively. Acetylcholine is sensed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on extrafusal muscle fibers, causing their contraction.|$|E
