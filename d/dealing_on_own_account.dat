40|$|The European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), {{expected}} to be implemented by October 2007, significantly modifies the regulation of the European securities industry. It will allow, among other things, investment firms to act as systematic internalizers. A systematic internalizer is an investment firm <b>dealing</b> <b>on</b> <b>own</b> <b>account</b> to execute client orders outside a regulated market or a multilateral trading facility (MTF). Specifically, systematic internalizers are required to publish firm quotes (i. e., to make a market) on liquid shares when dealing for retail quantities. This paper uses unique audit trail order data in order to estimate the fraction of order flow internalized, to evaluate the potential profitability of systematic internalization activity, and to investigate the main factors affecting both the fraction of order flow internalized and the magnitude of systematic internalization profitability. We use actually observed order flow data to simulate the systematic internalization activity. Each order submitted to the market has been scrutinized in order to verify the possibility of internalization based on the joint presence of the following two requirements (expressly requested by the Level 1 law text) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} in {{the first}} part theoretical aspects regarding merchandise imports <b>on</b> one’s <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> <b>on</b> short term trade credit. In the second part it approaches a practical application of accounts related to merchandise imports <b>on</b> one’s <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> <b>on</b> short term trade credit. Foreign Trade Companies’ merchandise imports, as an indirect form of organizing foreign trade, contains the sum of operations by which merchandise necessary to the national economy is bought for production or individual consumption. Just like exporting, importing can be done by foreign trade companies <b>on</b> their <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> or <b>on</b> commission. In indirect importing, on foreign trade companies’ <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> the abovementioned act on foreign markets and onward on the internal market, in their <b>own</b> name, <b>on</b> their <b>own</b> <b>account,</b> and at their own risk. Thus, the financial results of the import activity are reflected, in full, in the administration of the importing foreign trade company. Merchandise imports bought on credit, i. e. imports for which payment is made at a particular date, is determined by the shortage of financial resources of the importer. It is common practice both for simple and complex merchandise, however, generally complex merchandise is more frequently the subject of on credit acquisitions. import, merchandise, accounting, credit. ...|$|R
