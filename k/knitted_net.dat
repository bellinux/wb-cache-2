30|$|In {{the second}} {{iteration}} (Fig.  8), {{the experience of}} the net embracing the body became so distracting that any notion of context disappeared completely. The focus moved from playing with the fingers, to exploring the space that formed between the arms. Stretch sensors were added to the <b>knitted</b> <b>net</b> to sense deformation of the collar and transform it into sound. The intention was to create an object that would allow for the combination of dance and music performance. In the third iteration (Fig.  9), the dialogue between the net and the arms was developed further, allowing the performer to twist and turn the net. However, due to the difficulties of creating a functioning music instrument (latency, accuracy and robustness issues) the knitted collar moved to the background. The role of the wearable shifted. It became a support instrument to create soundscapes and allow other instruments to take a leading role in terms of music making. This shift gave bodily expression {{a central role in the}} music performance.|$|E

The paper deals with the German contributions to this process by examining the in approach and cartographic result most different examples of the two protectorates Deutsch-Südwestafrika (Namibia) and Deutsch-Ostafrika (Tanzania). Due to an early advance of route traverse mapping already {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century the area was fairly sufficiently mapped when Deutsch-Südwestafrika was established. As a consequence cartography hibernated to some degree until the Herero and Nama uprisings 1904 sparked off a full turn around with major efforts aiming at various map series from 1 : 25 000 to 1 : 400 000. Although geodetic highly innovative – e. g. the first implementation of Gauss-Krüger co-ordinates in German mapping – the lately tackled task of topographical field work left this most important imperial colony without any completed reliable map series at the outbreak of the war in 1914. Contrary Deutsch-Ostafrika lacked the abundance of criss-cross pre-colonial route traverses to build on. But exactly this short-comings triggered immediate and thorough efforts to survey that difficult terrain with its unhealthy tropical climate, thick bushes, high mountains and often hostile population.

40|$|Problem statement: In a {{historical}} {{study of the}} ancient communities {{in the area of}} Thung Kula, it was revealed that there are important resources including rice, fish, salt and iron. Salt is used in making fermented fish (known locally as Pla Daek), a culinary culture which has been prevalent in the ethnic groups of Laos and Khmer. The availability of rice and fish in Thung Kula has continued to this day. Thung Kula farmers have extended their fishing sources from the government-owned places to their own fields or ponds. Approach: They use fishing instruments that had been developed out of folk wisdom in combination with the new technology in order to increase the fishing yields adequate for their own consumption and for commerce. The present research aimed to study the adaptation of fishing instruments of the farmers at Ban Ta Yuak, Thung Luang sub-district, Suwannaphum district, Roi-Et province. The studied area was Thung Kula in the North East of Thailand. The research method was qualitative. Data were collected from relevant documents and from field studies with 25 informants. Structured and unstructured interviews were conducted with local tradesmen, consumers, fishing-instrument shop owners. Results: The results were presented descriptively below. The adaptation of fishing instruments of Ban Ta Yuak farmers began with the increased population, the changing ecological systems {{as a result of the}} governments construction of reservoirs, canals, public ponds and the market-oriented economy which had attracted the local fishing markets across the Thung Kula area. Ban Ta Yuak farmers have then adapted their fishing instruments to fit the available kinds of fish and the ecological systems of the local water sources. With assistance from the government, the farmers have their own fishing ponds. It was found that prior to the application of the national economic and social plan of 1962 these farmers created simple fishing instruments such as Sai (a bamboo fish trap), Sawing (a hand net), Hae (a cast net), Sum (a coop-like cover-trap) out of locally available materials like bamboos, vines, jute or cotton threads. In 1963, the Ban Ta Yuak farmers started using fishing instruments that combined natural materials with technological devices available in the markets. Presently, there are 9 kinds of them: A fish-trapping hole (replacing Hai or a earthen jar) made with a plastic bucket or pip (a tin container) the opening of which was covered with a nylon <b>knitted</b> <b>net,</b> sum (a coop-like cover-trap) made in a large size from bamboo strips and nylon strings with a wide opening and a frame of steel wires (instead of bamboo strips) covered with nylon nets, Yor (a dip net), Sawing (a hand net) with a metal hoop and nylon meshes (instead of jute or cotton ones), Hae (a cast net), Uan (a seine), Mong or a small seine-like fishing net traditionally made with knitted cotton threads, but presently made with synthetic fibers, fishing spears whose handles were made with Plaslon or PVC pipes, Lorb (a fish trap) and Sai (a fish trap), presently made with bamboo and nylon strings. Other fishing equipment included Khong (a fish container), Krasang (a floating fish basket), Takra (a fish basket) which were made wholly from synthetic fibers instead of bamboo or from a bamboo framework covered with knitted nylons. Conclusion/Recommendations: Adaptation of fishing instruments (by integrating synthetic materials) is appropriate and useful in that it saved the time in searching for usable natural materials and the communitys natural resources were preserved. Moreover, smaller fish were allowed to live and reproduce since the fishing instruments were designed for larger fish to be sold in local markets. It enabled the farmers to earn extra income by catching and selling fish...|$|E

50|$|Gaugain {{was born}} in the early 1800s and was the {{daughter}} of a tailor. After marrying, she worked in her husband's shop at 63 George Street and helped turn it into a thriving haberdashery. Gaugain wrote and disseminated knitting patterns throughout the 1830s from her shop and published her first pattern book in 1840. It was called 'Lady's Assistant in <b>Knitting,</b> <b>Netting</b> and Crochet.' She had a particular way of writing her patterns with full instructions at the beginning detailing the meanings of abbreviations. The book was very popular. To see the 1842 edition of this book click here. The book reached a massive audience in the UK and America and was the best-selling knitting book of the period. It ran to 22 editions. Throughout the 1840s and 50s, she published a great many titles. In response to reader's feedback, she began to produce charted paper and instructions that allowed knitters to create their own designs and began accepting mail orders at the Edinburgh shop. She died in 1860. She is buried in Edinburgh’s Dean Cemetery near the waters of Leith.|$|R
40|$|Polymeric meshes in {{the form}} of <b>knitted</b> <b>nets</b> are {{commonly}} used in the surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapses. Although a number of these prosthetic meshes are commercially available, there is little published data on their mechanical performance, in particular on the change in stiffness under the repeated loading experienced in vivo. In this in vitro study, cyclic tensile loading was applied to rectangular strips of four different commercially available meshes. The applied force and resultant displacement was monitored throughout the tests in order to evaluate the change in stiffness. In addition, each mesh was randomly marked using indelible ink in order to permit the use of threedimensional digital image correlation to evaluate local displacements during the tests. However, the scale and form of the deformation experienced by some of the meshes made correlation difficult so that confirmation of the values of stiffness were only obtained for two meshes. The results demonstrate that all the meshes experience an increase in stiffness during cyclic loading, that in most cases cyclic creep occurs and in some cases large-scale, irreversible reorganisation of the mesh structure occurs after as few as 200 cycles at loads of the order of 10 N...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this PhD project {{was to develop a}} method for {{non-linear}} strength analysis of net structures applied in the aquaculture and fishing industries, e. g. net cages and trawls. The work focused on the aquaculture net cage, which was applied in experiments and analyses, and included research to establish knowledge within material properties and failure modes of traditional netting materials for aquaculture. It was chosen to focus on tensile properties and to study elastic and plastic behaviour, fracture, creep behaviour and cod bite damage. The project consisted of three main activities: tensile testing of netting materials, studies and testing of cod bite damage and resistance, and structural analysis of aquaculture net cages. Net cages are built as a system of ropes and netting. They are designed to transfer and carry all major forces through the ropes. Loads from current, waves, weights and handling induce forces in the net cage, which must be dimensioned to withstand this. Analyzing an aquaculture net cage is both complex and time consuming due to non-linear effects, detailed geometry and dynamic loads. The behaviour of the net cage is dominated by very large deformations and displacements, and materials with non-linear properties. There is a need for verified analysis methods and specific guidance on how to reduce the complexity of a net cage analysis. In order to perform a strength analysis of a net cage, it is crucial to know the material properties of the netting material. Traditionally, the material property of major interest for the aquaculture industry has been the tensile breaking strength of netting (mesh) and ropes, and comparatively little focus has been on their detailed stiffness properties and general behaviour prior to fracture. A new test method was established to determine the uniaxial tensile properties of knotless netting materials. It was applied on a variety of netting materials and stress-strain relations were developed. Data on temporary creep properties, recovery of strain post creep and post creep tensile properties of a selection of Raschel <b>knitted</b> <b>netting</b> materials was presented. Post creep tensile testing showed that the length and force at break were not significantly affected by the creep load history. Cod farmers have reported that cod interact with the cage netting through biting and thereby create wear and tear. The nature of the cod bite attack on traditional, multifilament netting materials was described based on studies of cod interaction with traditional knotless netting and resulting fracture damage on netting fibres. Field experiments were performed, subjecting panels of netting to cod bite in commercial cod cages. In addition, a test method was developed to simulate damage on traditional netting from cod bite, and a prototype bite-jig was designed and assembled. It was concluded that netting materials for cod aquaculture must be resistant to cod bite or be repellent or uninteresting for cod. A method for numerical analysis of net cages in constant uniform current was developed and verified for limited solidity, deformations and current velocities. Various new designs for aquaculture net cages were presented and compared to a traditional net cage with regard to stresses in the netting material and deformation of the net cage.

40|$|The loop {{configuration}} that {{is obtained}} in the knit depends on both qualitative and quantitative factors, {{the most important of}} which is the loop length. Thus, it is necessary to have a geometrical model of knitted loop configuration. The aim of this research is to develop loop model for <b>net</b> <b>knit</b> structure with hexagonal cell which is formed by alternation of tricot and chain courses. Vertical ribs of such net structure consist of tricot closed loops of identical configuration while diagonal ribs consist of tricot and chain loops of different type, shape and form. In this study each loop is presented as sum of planar and spatial lines, the length of which can be easily calculated by the well-known formulas. Numerical dependences for loop length calculation are determined as a result of mathematical transformations. To verify the suggested model few variants of fillet warp knit structures were produced from polyester yarn. The investigation showed that theoretical average loop length of repeat corresponds to experimental value.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{defining}} the concept of intangible cultural heritage {{in the context of}} safeguarding of speeches, customs, historical and traditional cultural assets of Slavonia, Baranya and Syrmia. Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Croatia is endangered and it is becoming extinct due to the influence of a number of factors. Since the formulation of the 1999 Act on the Protection and Preservation of Cultural Goods, intangible cultural heritage has been under special protection as goods of interest to the Republic of Croatia and 85 items have been listed as intangible cultural heritage in the Register of Cultural Goods of the Republic of Croatia so far. Intangible cultural heritage is the subject of scientific research, as well {{as a part of the}} tourist offer (<b>knitting</b> fishing <b>nets,</b> reconstruction of customs), and some craft activities (pottery, lace making, apiculture). However, the issues related to the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage are numerous, the most important being the disorganized and insufficient documentation of intangible assets and dispersion of the collected documentation. This paper sets out to highlight the ways modern technology and scientific research can cooperate in the processing of intangible cultural assets, which seems to be the best and safest option for permanent preservation of intangible cultural heritage in its broadest sense. The preservation of intangible cultural heritage is regarded in this paper at four basic levels: the collection (digitization of data), the processing of data to the level of information, proper storage of data and information processed and the dissemination to final users. The vital step towards the realization of the goals is to gather all accessible data using modern technical tools and techniques. In the era of cloud computing and distributed data storage, it is necessary to provide sufficient data redundancy for permanent preservation, especially if such valuable information is in question. As an ultimate goal, it is necessary to disseminate the collected and preserved assets in a user-oriented manner, depending on the available and desired level of animation and technical knowledge of users...|$|R

For this reason, the use of wind and hail protection systems is recommended for kiwifruit vines in those agricultural areas where windy conditions and hailstorms occur with high frequency. However, the presence of anti-hail nets above the canopy can influence air temperature and humidity and can affect the quantity and/or quality of the light reaching the canopy. Our aim was to study the effect of photo-selective anti-hail nets on the vegetative growth, fertility, and fruit yield of kiwifruit vines, Actinidia deliciosa [(A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A. R.

40|$|Abstract Background Bursting {{strength}} {{is a standard}} method for evaluating mosquito net strength. This article suggests that tension strength with one grab and one hook better represent how holes are generated in bed nets in real life. Methods Measurements of bursting strength and tension strengths in the two directions are analysed for eight model nets created for the study. The nets {{were made in the}} most commonly used denier (75 and 100 D) and mesh (156 holes/inch 2) for multifilament polyester yarns, texturized or not, and with 4 or 6 sided holes. All were made from one polyester quality. Data was arranged in a randomized, complete block design and analysed for significant variables and their interactions. Data was then subjected to regression analyses using net square metre weight as a weighting factor with stepwise removal of variables. This revealed how the four textile variables interacted and allowed for making predictions for the strength of commercial nets in polyester or polyethylene. Results For the model nets, higher denier provided higher bursting strength and tension strengths, texturizing weakened nets and four-sided holes were stronger than six-sided holes. Even when compensating for square metre weight, 100 D nets are stronger than 75 D nets. Results for the commercial polyester net nets are less clear, probably because of different qualities of polyester. Tensile strength: a 75 denier <b>net</b> <b>knitted</b> tightly to provide the same square metre weight as a standard 100 denier net therefore does not obtain the same strength. Polyethylene nets are made of mono-fibre yarns and, therefore, have higher tension strength in both directions than multifilament polyester nets. For bursting strength results overlap for 100 denier yarns of both yarn types. As a class, commercial polyethylene nets are stronger than commercial polyester net whatever method is used for evaluation. Conclusion Tension strength measured in the length and width directions of the net using one hook and one clamp provide new relevant data as this method more closely imitates the cause of tear holes in nets as they occur in real life use. Using this methodology, the commercial monofilament yarn polyethylene nets are significantly stronger than the commercial multifilament polyester nets. This test method should be applied for nets used for years in the field. </p...|$|R
