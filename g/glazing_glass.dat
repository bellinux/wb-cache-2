40|$|This paper {{provides}} a quantitative {{measure of the}} bonding strength of structural silicone sealant applied to wood–double <b>glazing</b> <b>glass</b> joints for wood frame applications. The joint strength is assessed by tensile and shear experimental tests. The paper aims to characterize the joint behaviour through experimental tests in order to implement and validate a ﬁnite element (FE) model of the joint {{that can be used}} for whole frame characterization. The experimental tests are carried out on three wood species (Meranti, White Oak and Pine), and two different FE models of the wood–silicone–glass joint are implemented: the ﬁrst basic model assumes the modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture of the silicone as provided by the manufacturer, while the second model assumes the results of the experimental tensile tests. The results of the ﬁrst FE model do not ﬁt well with the tests carried out, while the second FE model proves to be more reliable and is validated by experimental results. The results report that, when modelling wood–double <b>glazing</b> <b>glass</b> joints by FE methods, the equivalent structural sealant modulus of elasticity assigned in the model should be about 50...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerical and {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis has}} been carried out to understand the performance of solar flat plate collector (SFPC) so as to improve its performance. Though SFPCs’ are been using as solar thermal collectors over the few decades, their thermal efficiency is considerably low. The thermal efficiency can be improved either by changing the geometric parameters or by changing its working fluid. The gap between absorber plate and glass, <b>glazing</b> <b>glass</b> thickness and number of glazing glasses plays a vital role in the performance of the SFPC. Since nanofluids possesses higher heat transfer coefficients, now-a-days they are been widely using in different engineering fields. Based on exergy analysis {{it has been shown that}} efficiency of SFPC has been improved considerably. Al 2 O 3 -water and CuO-water nanofluids are considered for the comparison. Heat transfer phenomenon inside the risers of SFPC is analyzed numerically by developing a 3 D model in commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. It is observed that that the proposed model is predicting the heat loss coefficients and fluid temperatures with good accuracy. The thermal efficiency obtained with this numerical model is validated against measured data. This paper also discusses about the heat transfer enhancement capabilities of nanofluid based SFPC...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} finite element (FE) {{model of a}} novel wooden window frame {{typology}} and validates it by experimental tests on a whole window frame and corner joint specimens. The focus is on double <b>glazing</b> <b>glass</b> frames and dowelled butt corner joints. The innovation consists on {{the application of the}} structural silicone sealant only at the interface between wood and one of the thin glass layers of the double-glazing glass, so achieving a low application depth. This application mode reduces the sealant quantity and allows the disassembly and substitution of the glass from the frame in case of breakage. In order to inform the FE model of the whole frame, the corner joint strength is measured by specific experimental tests. The test are carried out on meranti wood species and using a SIKA WT- 40 structural silicone. The results show an high correlation between the FE model and the experimental results in the range of small frame deformations, that are of interest for this application. The model is then applied to various wooden frame geometries in order to evaluate if the silicone application mode and dowelled corner joints allow an acceptable stiffness of the frame, and in particular low deformations of the bottom corner joint, {{in order to maintain the}} wooden frame functionality under external loads. This approach could be useful in the assessment of optimal wood-sealant-glass joint geometries, corner joint geometries and window frame geometries to limit the bottom corner joint deformation in the required range...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} on silicone structural sealants application {{in the field}} of wood window frames is growing fast, because of the introduction of novel production processes and stringent energy performance requirements of buildings. Structural timber-glass-sealant adhesive bonding assessments were carried out in several researches. The goal {{of this paper is to}} investigate the mechanism of adhesion and the properties of wood-structural silicone joints in order to understand the failure modes and strength of these bondings. For this purpose, tensile tests on wood-silicone joints were carried out in order to investigate the adhesion strength with different wood species. Moreover, peel tests have been carried out on wood-silicone joints in order to better understand the adhesion properties of the different materials. For this purpose, a dedicated belt was used, to avoid typical problems encountered during the standard peel test execution. In this investigation, both tests on untreated wood-silicone bonding and on coated wood-silicone bonding have been carried out, in order to capture the influence of wood species and wood primers on the adhesion to silicone. The results clearly proved that the adhesion strength between wood and structural silicone is highly influenced by the wood species, and a good correlation was found between tensile strength and breakage load in peel test. These results can be useful when assessing the strength of wood-silicone-double <b>glazing</b> <b>glass</b> joints and when informing FE models of wood frames joints and also to provide indications about optimal structural sealant application modes and selection of silicone typologies in wood frames applications...|$|E
