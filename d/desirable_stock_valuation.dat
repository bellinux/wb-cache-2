40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{significant}} issues in investment management is <b>stock</b> <b>valuation.</b> Investors and shareholders can value their own shares based on <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> models and make decisions on stock trading accordingly. This study attempts {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> and a company's management. In this regard, the present study uses field and library research methods, and examines 25 companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from the years 2009 to 2013 along with 125 observations. The results of this study suggest that managers’ success in <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> primarily depends on the correct understanding of influential resources and it is recommended that managers increase the value of their company's stock by the prober use and combination of factors effective in <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> according to the information of the company...|$|R

40|$|The study {{estimates}} the commodity prices and firm performance risk exposures of the Malaysian and Singaporean plantation {{and other related}} commodities’ sectors, using the Ohlson (1995) ’s, Easton and Harris (1991) ’s and other related asset prices together with return models augmented with accounting factors. Results show that the firm performance factors affect significantly and strongly <b>stock</b> <b>valuation.</b> However, the commodity prices affect determinants of firm performance and <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> weakly. The study also finds that both the commodity prices and firm performance together affect stock prices more significantly than the stock returns do. However, both of the constructed models which show the impacts of commodity prices and firm performance on <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> have better explanation than Ohlson (1995) ’s and Easton and Harris (1991) ’s models. This study proves that the relationships among commodity prices, firm performance and <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> of plantation and agriculture sectors are more considerable than other sectors’ over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} on equity securities has fluctuated considerably in the U. S. between 1917 - 2004. This study investigates whether personal taxes on equity securities are related to <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> using the time-series variation in tax burdens. The paper finds an economically and statistically significant relationship between asset valuations and personal tax rates. Consistent with tax capitalization, <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> tend to be relatively low when tax burdens are relatively high. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is a {{different}} impact from changes in "new" and "old" economy <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> on private investment for seven OECD economies. A vector autoregressive model is estimated for each individual country, using quarterly data over the period 1990 - 2000. We find that the impact from changes in valuations of new economy stocks to investment is roughly the same in North America and United Kingdom as in continental Europe. By contrast, the impact from changes in old economy <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> on investment is, in general, larger in North America and United Kingdom than in continental Europe. Finally, the results suggest that in continental Europe the impact on investment from changes in the valuation of new economy stocks is bigger than for old economy stocks, whereas for North America and United Kingdom the impact is more similar.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> and selection systems applied by European equity fund managers when selecting ordinary shares. It also includes examining the most significant micro and macroeconomic factors as well as economic indicators when investing in common shares. Additionally we present and review academic principles of corporate <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> and selection in order to provide background and tools helpful for prudent investment decision We conducted a survey among ten European equity fund managers across Austria, Great Britain and Sweden. The results indicate that no single <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> method is applied in isolation. The combination of available approaches is the option in use with respect to the fund objective. The most important factors or indicators when selecting ordinary shares are: the firm’s financial situation, the shareholder value policy, the business climate index, the firm’s expected earnings, the sales development and future demand trends. We also found evidence that qualitative business assessment is essential in corporate <b>stock</b> and firm <b>valuation.</b> Therefore, we argue that more efforts should be directed into this valuation area. ...|$|R

The labor-augmented model also substantially outperforms the baseline model in explaining the cross-section of <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> ratios, especially across investment-to-assets portfolios.

40|$|We examine {{corporate}} investment spending around the {{asset price bubble}} in Japan in the late 1980 s and make three contributions {{to our understanding of}} how <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> affect investment. First, investment responds significantly to nonfundamental components of <b>stock</b> <b>valuations</b> during asset price shocks; fundamentals matter less. Clearly, the stock market is not a sideshow.

Third, asset price shocks primarily affect firms that rely more on bank financing and not necessarily those that use equity financing. ...|$|R
40|$|Stock {{evaluation}} {{is one of}} the most important and most complex operational processes in the stock exchange. In financial markets, the pricing of tradable assets plays a basic role in resource allocation. After initial <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> of listed companies in Tehran Stock Exchange, some changes were observed in prices with the value set by the Stock Exchange. The aim of this study was to determine the model applied in the formation of stock prices in the stock market to find an appropriate market value model among value-based valuation models. To test the models of <b>stock</b> <b>valuation,</b> ordinary least square regression was used. Also, E-Views software was used for further data analysis. The sample included all the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange from 2008 till 2013. Based on the stratified random sampling, each industry was selected as a category and using Cochran formula, sample size of 40 participants was determined from each category. The data analysis indicated that the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) had the highest adjustment factor and had been set as the best <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> model...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{uncertainty}} about a firm’s long-run profitability could increase its <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> {{has been proposed}} by Pastor and Veronesi (2003) to explain a number of phenomena in financial markets. We further examine this idea by analyzing a simple valuation model for both stocks and bonds, {{in contrast to the}} existing studies focusing on stocks only. Unless a firm is deeply in debt, our model implies that uncertainty about a firm’s profitability increases its <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> and decreases its bond valuation, where uncertainty’s impact is stronger if the firm’s leverage is higher. Using a number of existing uncertainty proxies in the literature and controlling for volatility, we empirically test these predictions. Consistent with the existing literature, our empirical evidence also supports the positive association of <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> and uncertainty for all uncertainty proxies. For only one proxy, our empirical evidence is also broadly consistent with uncertainty being negatively related to bond valuation and more so with greater leverage. However, the results based on all other uncertainty proxies generally (for example firm age) do not show a negative association with bond valuations. These results point to a number directions for further examination. Uncertainty, convexity, valuation, technology bubble...|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} and empirically implements a <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> model.

The resulting <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> formula has three variables as input: net earnings-per-share, expected earnings growth, and interest rate. Using a sample of stocks, our empirical exercise shows that the derived valuation formula produces significantly lower pricing errors than existing models, both in- and out-of-sample.

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a family of}} <b>stock</b> <b>valuation</b> models {{that are based on}} book values and earnings. The theoretical models address, among other features, two critical aspects of the stock market: the pricing of zero-dividend and negative earnings stocks. The modeling approach can be consistent with a large class of allowable dividend policies and does not require an explicit forecast of future book values. Reconciling empirical evidence, the model determined expected rate of return is related to book-to-market and earnings yield. Model implementation using S&P 500 stocks yields several empirical results. First, the performance yardsticks indicate that the models show promise in explaining market valuations. Second, both book and earnings considerations are crucial in <b>stock</b> <b>valuation.</b> Finally, zero-dividend and negative earnings stocks present no particular valuation hurdles with reasonable goodness-of-fit statistics...|$|R
