5000|$|Thamnophis sauritus sauritus, the <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> or common ribbon snake, is a {{subspecies}} of ribbon snake {{found in}} the northeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> {{gets its}} name from its very thin body. At maturity, it grows to between 18 and 86 cm in length. It is a slender, black snake with a yellow {{mid-back}} stripe and one on each side. A brown stripe {{of one or two}} rows of scales extends onto the sides of the belly. The rest of the belly is a greenish-white color. It also has two rows of black spots between the back and side stripes. It also has a long tail that is {{about a third of the}} length of its body. The labial scales around the mouth of the snake are unmarked and uniformly bright yellow or white. A white or light-yellow bar borders the front of the eyes. Juveniles are colored like adults.Some aspects of the <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> make it different from a close relative, the garter snake. The eastern has a much thinner body than a garter snake. Its tail makes up about one third of its body length. This snake has stripes on the third and fourth scale rows. The <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> has pure white lips and a mark of white color in front of its eyes. This snake is not venomous.|$|E
50|$|The {{pickerel}} frog's poisonous secretions cannot {{stop all}} creatures; green frogs, bull frogs, northern water <b>snakes,</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snakes,</b> and common garter snakes are their usual predators. When threatened, pickerel frogs will {{jump into the}} water and dive to the bottom to escape predators like birds and snakes.|$|R
50|$|Reproduction in <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snakes</b> {{takes place}} after they emerge from {{hibernation}} in the spring, in April or May. Mating occasionally {{takes place in}} the fall, but the female will delay fertilization and development until the next spring. The average gestation period is three months. The average number of young is around 12, but can range four to 27. Females give birth in late summer or the early fall. After birth, no parental care is involved; the young are left to fend for themselves. Most young reach sexual maturity after two years, but most usually wait until the third year.|$|R
25|$|The Upper Peninsula {{contains}} a large variety of wildlife. Some of the mammals {{found in the}} U.P. include shrews, moles, mice, white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, cougar, gray and red foxes, wolves, river otters, martens, fishers, muskrats, bobcats, coyotes, snowshoe hares, cotton-tail rabbits, porcupines, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, opossum and bats. There is a large variety of birds, including hawks, osprey, owls, gulls, hummingbirds, chickadees, robins, woodpeckers, warblers, and bald eagles. In terms of reptiles and amphibians, the U.P. has common garter snakes, red bellied snakes, pine snakes, northern water snakes, brown snakes, eastern garter snakes, <b>eastern</b> fox <b>snakes,</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> back <b>snakes,</b> green snakes, northern ringneck snakes, Eastern Milk Snakes (Mackinac and Marquette counties) and Eastern Hognose snakes (Menominee County only), plus snapping turtles, wood turtles, and painted turtles (the state reptile), green frogs, bullfrogs, northern leopard frogs, and salamanders. Lakes and rivers contain many fish such as walleye, muskie, northern pike, trout, salmon, bullhead catfish, and bass. Invasive species like the alewife and sea lamprey {{can be found in}} the Great Lakes. The U.P. also contains many shellfish, such as clams, aquatic snails, and crayfish. The American Bird Conservancy and the National Audubon Society have designated several locations as internationally Important Bird Areas.|$|R
50|$|His wife, Nita Jane Rossman (born 1936), {{also has}} an {{interest}} in herpetology and even had a subspecies named after her: Thamnophis sauritus nitae, a subspecies of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake.</b> She had collected the holotype for this subspecies on a field trip with her husband for his dissertation research, and he named it in her honor.|$|E
5000|$|The lake is {{also home}} to the Knox Conservation Lands, an area donated to the Nova Scotia Nature trust in order to {{permanently}} preserve a section of the lakes ecosystem. The Knox Conservation Lands are home to the only known habitat in Canada for the Lachnanthes (Carolina Redroot) and the first formally protected habitat of the above mentioned <b>Eastern</b> <b>Ribbon</b> <b>Snake.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interior camping {{can provide}} {{excellent}} wildlife viewing opportunities. Moose, warblers, white-tailed deer, barred owls, beavers, porcupines, woodpeckers, martens, and loons are not uncommon, especially along waterways. Black bears, though {{present in the}} park, are seldom seen. Coyotes are also present in this park. Harbour and grey seals are often seen along the seaside coast basking on its rocks. There are several uncommon species of organisms that call Kejimkujik their home. The Blanding's turtle which is considered an endangered species in Nova Scotia is similar in size to the common painted turtle; however the Blanding's is characterized by its yellow neck. Juveniles measure between 5 and 12 cm in carapace diameter while adult females can measure between 25 and 35 cm. It is a very gentle turtle that frequently nests on beaches that are accessible by the public. For this reason {{it is important for}} visitors {{to be careful not to}} disturb nesting turtles, and to report any sightings to the visitor centre. The <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> is a threatened species in Nova Scotia and lives in several isolated areas in the park. The <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake,</b> upon first glance, may be easily confused with the common garter snake, but the <b>eastern</b> <b>ribbon</b> <b>snake</b> is defined by three longitudinal yellow stripes on the dorsal side and a black or dark brown colouration. Adult eastern ribbon snakes in the park usually measure between 50 and 70 cm in length. Kejimkujik is one of two places in Canada where Hydrocotyle umbellata or water pennywort exists. The other is in Yarmouth County.|$|E

They do not dive like water snakes; they glide across the surface of the water, instead.|$|E
