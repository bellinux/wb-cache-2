5|$|The ninth day {{of racing}} {{resulted}} in a bunch sprint that was won by Sørensen. The next stage of the race was a forty-two kilometer individual time trial. Race leader Rominger won the leg by one minute and twenty-four seconds and increased his overall lead to three minutes over Casagrande, who was in second place overall. Enrico Zaina and Nelson Rodríguez Serna were the first two riders to reach the stage's final climb of Il Cioccio and the two stayed out in front until the finish which saw Zaina win the race to the line. With four kilometers left in the stage, Ugrumov and Berzin attempted to crack Rominger by attacking him repeatedly. After several attacks where the riders moves were marked, the riders agreed to ride to the finish together. The twelfth stage of the race saw the peloton arrive at the finish together ready <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> sprint. Cipollini originally won the stage but was relegated to last place on the stage after having {{been found to have}} leaned on Mario Manzoni during the dash to the line. Ján Svorada, who had come in second, was then made the stage winner.|$|E

[...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of other reasons.
