5|$|Although some reviewers {{initially}} {{expressed concerns}} about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named <b>it</b> <b>their</b> Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed {{as one of the}} greatest video games of all time.|$|E

The changes to the specification and a collapse {{in the price of}} collectible cars brought about by the early 1990s recession resulted in many buyers choosing not to exercise their purchase options. A total of just 275 cars were produced by the time production ended, each with a retail price of £470,000 in 1992 making <b>it</b> <b>their</b> most expensive car during its debut.|$|E

5|$|The artwork's {{concept was}} {{originated}} by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald, who illustrated the members performing with a lobster claw {{coming out of}} an amplifier and a snake around their feet. Following the drawing's completion, MacDonald sent it to the band {{and they decided to}} make <b>it</b> <b>their</b> Road to Ruin album cover. This sketch did, however, include original drummer Tommy, so the drawing had to be modified to depict Marky instead. This alteration was undergone by artist John Holmstrom, a Punk magazine associate and designer.|$|E

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording <b>it,</b> <b>their</b> creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, metalcore was {{evolving}} to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal. The album Reckless & Relentless by British band Asking Alexandria (which sold 31,000 copies {{in its first}} week), and The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album Dead Throne (which sold 32,400 in its first week) reached up to number 9 and 10, respectively, on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album Sempiternal to critical acclaim. The album debuted at number 3 on the UK Album Chart and at number 1 in Australia. The album sold 27,522 copies in the US, and charted at number 11 on the US Billboard Chart, making <b>it</b> <b>their</b> highest charting release in America until their follow-up album That's the Spirit debuted at no. 2 in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a virtual}} {{listening}} {{party on the}} band's website where the full ten songs from the record were made available to listen to, Spiritual Machines was released in Canada on December 12, 2000. For those who pre-ordered the album, a limited edition version of the CD was released in a black jewel {{case in which the}} artwork was not visible, only the band's name and logo in embossed lettering. Spiritual Machines sold 36,394 copies in its debut week, and would sell a total of 100,000 units in the first month after its release, making <b>it</b> <b>their</b> fastest selling album to date. It went on to be certified 2X Platinum in Canada. As was common practice, the album was released several months later in the United States on March 13, 2001. Upon release in the United States, it spent a total of four weeks on the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 81. In the United States, the album has yet to be certified by the RIAA. It was released to Asian and European markets on May 9, 2001 under the Epic Records label. The record was re-released in 2008 under the Sony's Special Markets division.|$|E

5|$|In 1530, the Maltese islands {{along with}} the North African port city of Tripoli {{were given to the}} Order of Saint John by Emperor Charles V. The knights settled in the town of Birgu and made <b>it</b> <b>their</b> capital. Soon after their arrival, the Order rebuilt the Castrum Maris, calling it Fort Saint Angelo. Later on, the entire town of Birgu began to be {{surrounded}} by new fortifications, in a similar style to the Order's earlier defences in Rhodes. Birgu's land front was built by 1540. Following the attack of 1551, the Order realised the need to build more defences. Two forts were built in 1552 - Fort Saint Elmo {{at the tip of the}} Sciberras Peninsula, on the site of an Aragonese watchtower, and Fort Saint Michael on Isola. In 1553, a new fortified city began to be built around Fort Saint Michael, and it was named Senglea after the Grand Master who built it.|$|E
5|$|In 972 A.D., {{during the}} rule of Khottiga Amoghavarsha, the Paramara King Siyaka Harsha {{attacked}} the empire and plundered Manyakheta, {{the capital of the}} Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district, declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. Indra IV, the last emperor, committed Sallekhana (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at Shravanabelagola. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made <b>it</b> <b>their</b> capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River– Godavari River doab called Vengi. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.|$|E
