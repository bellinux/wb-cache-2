In this paper we show quantitative results for a flaring loop with a realistic magnetic geometry, derived from a magnetic field extrapolation, and containing an electron distribution with typical thermal and nonthermal parameters, after folding through the instrumental profile of a realistic interferometric array. We compare the parameters generated from <b>forward</b> <b>fitting</b> a homogeneous source model to each line of sight through the folded image data cube with both the original parameters used in the model and with parameters generated from <b>forward</b> <b>fitting</b> a homogeneous source model to the original (unfolded) image data cube. We find excellent agreement in general, but with systematic effects that can be understood as due to finite resolution in the folded images and the variation of parameters along the line of sight, which are ignored in the homogeneous source model. We discuss the use of such 2 D parameter maps within a larger framework of 3 D modeling, and the prospects for applying these methods to data from a new generation of multifrequency radio arrays now or soon to be available.

Addition of a steep thermal component at low E did not prevent recovery of features at higher values of E. <b>Forward</b> <b>fitting</b> did recover large-scale forms and features well but, inevitably, failed to recover local features not expressible within the parametric used.

30|$|Hubbert was {{the first}} scholar to use <b>forward</b> curve <b>fitting.</b> Hubbert pointed out {{bell-shaped}} curve regularity of fossil energy development (Hubbert 1949). In 1956, Hubbert used a hand-drawn bell-shaped curve to forecast oil production in the 48 contiguous states of the USA. According to his prediction, the US oil production would peak in the early 1970 s and then decrease (Hubbert 1956). This prediction was confirmed by the actual oil production. Because of this successful prediction and the social concern about oil shortage, using bell-shaped curves to predict oil production has become especially popular. More and more scholars have begun {{to join in the}} forecasting of oil production. The forecasting method used by Hubbert has been adopted by more and more people and is named the “Hubbert model.” Although many scholars used this method, Hubbert had not given the specific formula of the method and its derivation. Until 1982, for the first time, Hubbert published the full formula and derivation process of the Hubbert model (Hubbert 1982). Since then, Hubbert model has been widely used.|$|R

The fit to RHESSI data on four flares for a single power law F-o(E-o) is much improved when ionization structure is included compared to when the usual fully ionized approximation is used.

It is designed to use the <b>forward</b> <b>fitting</b> technique {{to search for the}} set of best-fit parameter values in parametrized model functions. Sherpa can also estimate the confidence limits on best-fit parameters using a new confidence method or using an algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Confidence limits on parameter values are necessary for any data analysis result, but can be non-trivial to compute in a non-linear and multi-parameter space. This new, robust confidence method can estimate confidence limits of Sherpa parameters using a finite convergence rate. The Sherpa extension module, pyBLoCXS, implements a sophisticated Bayesian MCMC-based algorithm for simple single-component spectral mod-els defined in Sherpa. pyBLoCXS has primarily been developed in Python using high-energy X-ray spectral data.

We use a sample of about 200 long GRBs with known redshift to determine the luminosity and formation rate evolutions and the general shape of the luminosity function. In contrast to most other <b>forward</b> <b>fitting</b> methods of treating this problem we use the Efron Petrosian methods which allow a non-parametric determination of above quantities. We find a relatively strong luminosity evolution, a luminosity function that can be fitted to a broken power law, and an unusually high rate of formation rate at low redshifts, a rate more than one order of magnitude higher than the star formation rate (SFR).

For each ANN model, two architectures were constructed separately; 4 layers and 7 layers, each with different numbers of hidden layer units (5, 10 and 15). Ten different ANN optimization training algorithms (LM, BFG, BR, CGF, GD, GDM, GDA, GDX, OSS and RP) {{were used to}} train each model separately. Many experiments were conducted for {{each one of the}} five models. Each model used two different architectures, a different number of hidden layer neurons and ten different training algorithms. The performance results of the models were compared according to mean square error to identify the best ANN model. The results showed that the PatternNet model was the best model used. Finally, comparisons between the ten training algorithms were performed through training the PatternNet model. Comparison results showed that TrainLM was the best training algorithm for the {{iris recognition}} system...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{pressure}} level in-situ measurements {{are sensitive to}} standing-wave pressure minima and {{have the potential to}} result in over-amplification with risk to residual hearing in hearing-aid <b>fittings.</b> <b>Forward</b> {{pressure level}} (FPL) quantifies the pressure traveling toward the tympanic membrane and may be a potential solution as it is insensitive to ear-canal pressure minima. Derivation of FPL is dependent on a Thevenin-equivalent source calibration technique yielding source pressure and impedance. This technique is found to accurately decompose cavity pressure into incident and reflected components in both a hard-walled test cavity and in the human ear canal through the derivation of a second sound-level measure termed integrated pressure level (IPL). IPL is quantified by the sum of incident and reflected pressure amplitudes. FPL and IPL were both investigated as measures of sound-level entering the middle ear. FPL may be a better measure of middle-ear input because IPL is more dependent on middle-ear reflectance and ear-canal conductance. The use of FPL in hearing-aid applications is expected to provide an accurate means of quantifying high-frequency amplification...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is aimed at}} delineating the post-impact structural characteristics across the Serra da Cangalha impact crater in Brazil {{using a combination of}} magnetotelluric (MT) and aeromagnetic data. The MT survey was carried out along three radial MT profiles trending NW–SE, ENE–WSW and NNE–SSW across the crater. For MT sites located further away from the centre of the crater, isotropic MT responses were observed, suggesting a 1 D conductivity distribution in the subsurface in the frequency range of 100 – 10 Hz. For sites located {{in the vicinity of the}} inner ring of the crater, anisotropic responses were observed for the same frequency range. We believe that this zone probably represents the areas of structural disturbance. A 2 D resistivity inversion of these data reveals a four-layer model, representing a thin resistive layer underlain by a conductive layer, a weathered basement and a resistive crystalline basement. The depth to the top of the basement is estimated to be about 1. 2 km. This is in good agreement with the estimation of depth to the basement of about 1. 1 km, calculated using the aeromagnetic data. However, in view of the circular geometry of the crater, we have carried out a 3 D forward modeling computation to supplement the derived 2 D model. The 3 D resistivity <b>forward</b> model, <b>fitting</b> the MT responses by trial-by-error revealed a five-layer model, showing a significant reduction in the basement resistivity. This, perhaps, could be due to the structural disturbances that have been caused by the impact on the crater, resulting in brecciation, fracturing, alteration and shocked zone filled with weak-magnetic materials and fluids. We have calculated the effect of the impact on the overall structural deformation beneath the Serra da Cangalha crater, following the classical crater scaling relation of Holsapple and Schmidt [Holsapple, K. A., Schmidt, R. M., 1982. On the scaling of crater dimensions. II. Impact processes. J. Geophys. Res. 87, 1849 – 1870] and found to be about 2 km...|$|R
