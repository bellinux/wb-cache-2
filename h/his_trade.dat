5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates.

The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{managerial}} insider trading, with suitable regulations, mitigates {{the problem of}} information asymmetry and subsequently helps shareholders (or the board) to exert better control over corporate decisions. In a setting where {{the manager of a}} firm has private information about a potential investment project and his personal preference for investment differs from those of shareholders, I demonstrate the existence of a unique perfect-sequential equilibrium, in the spirit of Grossman and Perry (1986), where the manager's inside information is partially revealed through his voluntary purchase of the firm's stock, and shareholders screen the investment proposal based on the revealed information. However, for insider trading to be a credible signalling device, restrictions must be imposed that require the insider to publicly report <b>his</b> <b>trading</b> activity and prohibit him from making short-term reversals of <b>his</b> <b>trading</b> position. On the other hand, the insider may be allowed to make a profit from <b>his</b> <b>trading...</b>|$|R
