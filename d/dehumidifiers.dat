5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying <b>dehumidifiers</b> when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} application of a liquid desiccant <b>dehumidifier</b> system in confined building spaces. The proposed <b>dehumidifier</b> system controls the humidity ratio of the confined space when a large amount of moisture is released, and uses ambient space air for regeneration when the spaces produce no moisture. The generated moisture air during the regeneration period can be discharged through continuous exhaust ventilation. ^ In the dissertation, the physical system design is described and <b>dehumidifier</b> performance models and CFD models are integrated and developed. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the results of a conventional ventilation system and a <b>dehumidifier</b> system. ^ The results of the simulations show that the <b>dehumidifier</b> system reduced moisture condensation by 24. 0 % over a conventional exhaust ventilation system. It was also found that the configurations of the confined space and <b>dehumidifier,</b> e. g., the locations of the inlet air, exhaust air and moisture source, significantly impacted the space air humidity ratio and temperature distributions. ^ The theoretical analysis in the feasibility investigation suggests that an optimal <b>dehumidifier</b> system reduces moisture condensation and saves energy. Thus, the system optimizations are achieved by three approaches: optimal <b>dehumidifier</b> design parameters, improved <b>dehumidifier</b> location, and optimal regeneration period. ^ The results of the optimizations show that an improved <b>dehumidifier</b> location can reduce moisture condensation by 33. 1 % over the original <b>dehumidifier</b> location in the feasibility investigation. In addition, use of an optimal reheat desiccant temperature can reduce the regeneration period by 16. 0 % and the total performance period by 12. 5 %. ^ Yearly energy consumption and cost were compared between a base ventilation system and an optimal <b>dehumidifier</b> system for a bathroom in a hotel at two locations of Miami and Omaha. The comparisons were conducted for both systems with the same amount of accumulated condensation on the surfaces of the space. The total yearly electricity energy consumption in an optimal <b>dehumidifier</b> system can be saved by 63. 7 % in Omaha and 65. 2 % in Miami. The heating consumption can be saved by 66. 7 % in Omaha and 66. 7 % in Miami. The average yearly energy cost saving is around 65. 5 %. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolar {{distillation}} is {{a widely}} researched option for producing potable water in water-starved regions of the globe. Despite its technical simplicity and easiness-to-use, its efficiency has not sufficiently improved to promote its widespread use. The reasons for relative inefficiency of solar distillation are poor energy harvest at solar collectors, poor utilization of the harvested energy for evaporation {{of the water and}} suboptimum condensation of the humidified air in the condenser. A novel concept of solar still attempts to optimize the humidification-dehumidification cycle of a solar distillation unit to address these issues related to solar distillation units. The system works in a closed air open water humidification-dehumidification cycle. The energy source is solar irradiation, which heats up an air-water mixture. The driving force in the system is a small suction pressure induced in the system due to an aerator attached to the water inlet. A helical coil <b>dehumidifier</b> achieves efficient dehumidification in the system. The current paper describes experiments conducted to improve the efficiency of the <b>dehumidifier</b> attached to the novel solar distillation unit by optimizing the design parameters. The <b>dehumidifier</b> has the shape of a helical coil heat exchanger, which is cooled by the relatively cold water from a reservoir, which conversely, is heated by the heat of condensation. Even though there are sufficient studies on the design parameters of general helical coil condensers in literature, few studies are done to study their use in a humidification-dehumidification cycle involving non-condensable air. Further, a detailed parameter study of the helical coil <b>dehumidifier</b> is not yet done. The current paper discusses the various design parameters of a helical coil <b>dehumidifier</b> working in conjunction with a solar distillation unit as described above. Different design parameters of a helical coil <b>dehumidifier</b> discussed in this paper are pitch and diameter of the helical <b>dehumidifier.</b> Design insights for helical coil <b>dehumidifier</b> are thus obtained.
