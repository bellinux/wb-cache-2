40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine how policy {{documents}} in Norway the last ten years have interpreted ICT and <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in teacher education and in school. Norway implemented in 2006 a new national curriculum which increased the status of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> to be the fifth basic skill in the Norwegian elementary school (stage 1 - 13). This was a historic event and never before has <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> achieved such status in curricula, neither nationally nor internationally. The same has newly happened with the new General Plan for Teacher Education where <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> has become the fifth basic skill in all subjects. However, both teacher educators and teachers lack sufficient <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> to fulfil these ambiguous policy goals and therefore the article suggest how a model of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> can bridge some of the gap between the intentions in the policy documents and the teachers/teacher educators’ practise. At the same time the article attempts to elaborate our perception of the concept <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in an educational discourse and how one can define <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in light of a Scandinavian educational perspective. The research question in this article is: how can <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> be defined and what are the foundations of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in teacher education and schools in light of the policy documents in Norway? </p...|$|R

30|$|The CDES that we {{designed}} {{is based on}} a series of referents and models specified in the introduction to this paper. This does not mean that its importance should be minimized, since it constitutes one of the few existing models for the determination of generic <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> within the higher education study framework. In this respect, our study complements other proposals made from different perspectives. By way of example, it is worth mentioning models that determine the importance of <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> in higher education lecturers (Jeffs & Banister, 2006; Masood, 2010; Naci & Ferhan, 2009; Rong & Ling, 2008), to which it is necessary to add those studies describing the importance of standards related to <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> in the training of higher education students (Alan & Pitt, 2010; Hong & Jung, 2010; Kadijevich & Haapasalo, 2008; Kaminski, Switzer, & Gloeckner, 2009; Li-Ping & Jill, 2009; Niederhauser, Lindstrom, & Strobel, 2007; Voithofer, 2005).|$|E

Following the theoretical framework of the EU Kids Online project, we assessed the <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> of Romanian Youth at three levels: as 1. the range of online activities, 2. the attitudes towards the internet and 3. the self-efficacy perception (Sonck et al., 2012). The results of our study confirm in broad lines the statistical evidences of the EU Kids Online survey (Sonck et al., 2011), also offering a contextual and in depth understanding of the phenomenon by showing that the passage from the repetitive and passive consumption of the internet to the more creative activities – which top the „ladder of opportunities” (Livingstone, Haddon, 2009) – requires parental and/or school active mediation (Velicu, Barbovschi, further-coming).

40|$|During recent years, {{blogging}} {{has become}} established {{as an important}} part of Norwegian girls’ digital media culture. Girls who blog are often trivialized in the Norwegian public sphere; the activity itself is frequently the subject of heated debate but we seldom hear about the experiences tied to the blogging of these girls. This dissertation acknowledges, documents, and theorizes girls’ experiences of participation in mainstream blogging in Norway that is competitive, body-focused, and commercialized. This work emphasizes girls’ perspectives in order to address some of the gaps in the literature that often fails to shed light on girls’ experiences of identity performances online and their meaning making of <b>digital</b> <b>competences.</b> Combining qualitative in-depth interviewing, ethnographic analyses of blogs, and critical discourse analysis of Norwegian press coverage in a longitudinal design, I investigate how girls perform blogging selves over time, which <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> they find meaningful for participation in mainstream blogging, and how they are positioned in the press commentary via the identity label of “pink blogger”. Drawing on a combination of theoretical frameworks and methods, I strive for a holistic investigation of girls’ experiences that takes into consideration both the realities of everyday interactions with the mainstream blogging community and the audience, and of the wider cultural contexts and gendered discourses that frame, regulate, and discipline these everyday interactions. According to my findings, girls in mainstream blogging are trivialized in the press commentary as superficial, body-obsessed, and commercial pink bloggers. In contrast to these homogenizing and fixed implications of the pink blogger label, I argue that girls perform identity in blogs in various ways, picking up strategies of performing the blogging self according to goals that often change, and identifying with these performances to varying degrees. Similarly, the meanings the girls tie to <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> are varied, both aligning and contrasting with what is documented as beneficial in the literature. While girls are undoubtedly agents in performing identity and developing <b>digital</b> <b>competences,</b> the identity performances and development of <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> are also clearly framed by the norm of competitiveness, body focus, and commercialization of the mainstream blogging community {{as well as by the}} wider cultural contexts and gendered discourses beyond this community, including the pink blogger label and the normative ideal of the gender equal, socially engaged Nordic Girl...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine factors {{predicting}} lower secondary school students’ <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> and to explore differences between students when it comes to <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> Results from a <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> test and survey in lower secondary school will be presented. It is important to learn more about and investigate what characterizes students’ <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> A sample of 852 ninth-grade Norwegian students from 38 schools participated in the study. The students answered a 26 item multiple-choice <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> test and a self-report questionnaire about family background, motivation, and previous grades. Structural equation modeling was used to test a model of the hypothesised relationship between family background, mastery orientation, previous achievements, and <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> The results indicate variation in <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> among the ninth-graders. Further, analyses showed that students’ conditions at home, i. e., language integration and cultural capital, together with mastery orientation and academic achievements predict students <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> This study indicates that that there is evidence of digital diversity between lower secondary students. It does not seem like the development of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> among the students happens automatically. Students’ family background and school performance are the most important factors. Therefore, as this study shows, it is necessary to further investigate how schools can identify students’ level of competence and to develop plans and actions for how schools can help to try to equalize differences...|$|R
30|$|The {{advanced}} level of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> {{on the internet}} was reached {{with the use of}} both intensive and moderate types of expansive learning. In this sample, 71.1 % of female university students who used a form of expansive and intensive learning obtained an {{advanced level}} in <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> This form of learning was characterized by the use of a broad diversity of learning strategies, including conventional, collaborative and autonomous strategies. The women who used these expansive learning strategies in ICT did not present basic levels of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> (0 %) and only 28.9 % showed a moderate level of <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b> Women who learnt expansively but moderately presented an advanced degree of <b>digital</b> <b>competence.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} <b>digital</b> <b>competence,</b> this study {{confirms}} {{the hypothesis that}} university students’ <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> has a positive association with students’ DIL, while students with higher level of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> tend to more get involved in DIL. Prior studies fund that students’ digital literacy does not have significant effects on university students’ technology use for learning and claims that, {{in the context of}} education, the basic technology skill is no longer a major obstacle for most students (Lai et al., 2012). In contrast, this study shows <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> has a significant and medium effects on DIL since digital informal learning features are learner- centered and <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> still matters in learner controlled informal personal context.|$|R
30|$|In {{the light}} of all the above, {{the aim of this}} Delphi study is to design and {{validate}} a questionnaire constructed on the basis of various digital competence standards through which the perceived importance of the acquisition of <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> in higher education can be specifically assessed by a panel of experts.|$|E
30|$|Other studies {{point to}} a high {{perception}} of female university students in terms of <b>digital</b> <b>competences.</b> According to Rebollo-Catalán, Mayor-Buzón, et al. (2015), women learn using {{a wide variety of}} learning contexts and resources and in so doing they reach an advanced level of digital competence in the networks. In turn, the study by García-González et al. (2012) also shows that basic <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> are not necessarily transferred to the use of technology for educational purposes. One could say that the diversity of technologies that are used informally are not used in university education. The recent study by Jiménez-Cortés (2015), focusing on the ubiquitous learning of women in social networks, highlights that a large percentage of young women do not often use these digital technologies during their university academic activity, instead they prefer to use them at other times.|$|E
30|$|As the {{literature}} shows, there are studies that confirm and refute {{that there are}} significant differences {{between males and females}} in the use of technology; but there has been no study on whether such differences exist in terms of the basic <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> that a student can employ throughout his/her university life and later in the job market. The reason for focusing the study in the area of Social Sciences is that degrees such as Social Education, Social Work and Pedagogy share three generic competences based on technology that are common to all subjects (1) Competence in the use of ICT resources. (2) Competence in the search for relevant information and (3) Competence in the management and organization of information. Therefore, our study aims to determine whether through Bayes factor method, we can attribute significant differences in basic <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> to first-year male and female university students studying Social Sciences courses, specifically Social Education, Social Work and Pedagogy, in Spain.|$|E

30|$|Once we had {{verified}} the unidimensionality of {{the internet}} <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> scale, we calculated a global variable from the sum of items: “Degree of digital competence” (0 – 54). For this paper, we have presented the results of global digital competence on a three point scale (0 – 17 [*]=[*]Basic; 18 – 35 [*]=[*]Moderate; and, 36 – 54 [*]=[*]Advanced), after we had checked that this recoding had not affected its validity and reliability.|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> remains {{an issue of}} {{interest}} for both the scientific community and the supranational political agenda. This study uses the Delphi method to validate {{the design of a}} questionnaire to determine the perceived importance of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in higher education. The questionnaire was constructed from different framework documents in <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> standards (NETS, ACLR, UNESCO). The triangulation of non-parametric techniques made it possible to consolidate the results obtained through the Delphi panel, the suitability of which was highlighted through the expert competence index (K). The resulting questionnaire emerges as a good tool for undertaking future national and international studies on <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in higher education.|$|R
30|$|The {{study also}} {{revealed}} that there are gender differences on different subscales of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> which {{is in line with}} a traditional view of males as being more digitally competent than females (Markauskaite, 2006; Tømte & Hatlevik, 2011). However, no significant differences have been found on most subscales of <b>digital</b> <b>competence,</b> which confirms the previous results that female and male students are equal in terms of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> (Hatlevik & Christophersen, 2013; Markauskaite, 2006).|$|R
30|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{assessing}} of students’ <b>digital</b> <b>competence,</b> it is important to provide the correct descriptors to specify the presence of the term into precise areas.

During their career, teachers assume an important role in the education process of their students. The assessing of the <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> of an individual is a complex procedure. It is based on evaluation the following: information, communication, content creation, problem solving, and safety. Recent studies employ three types of instruments for measuring the level of digital competence: questionnaires (mostly self-evaluations) designed to obtain information about an individual’s use of technology, the analysis of the results of problem-solving tests, and the gathering and analysis of secondary data. In this study, we use an adapted instant Digital Competence Assessment instrument, which encompasses three dimensions: cognitive, technical and ethical. The analysis of the results showed that in order for an individual to achieve a particular level of digital competence, as measured by this instrument, the levels of technological and cognitive dimensions are of utmost importance...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} focuses on how three teacher {{educators}} attempt {{to enhance their}} <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> by participating in the project “Teach As We Preach (TAWP) ”. At a policy level in Norway, high priority is given to information and communication technology (ICT) through the new educational reform (Læreplan for Kunnskapsløftet [LK 06]). The ICT density is high in school, with one laptop per student considered desirable - a goal that is accomplished in upper secondary school. The main obstacle, however, {{seems to be the}} lack of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> among both pre-service and in-service teachers. However, the new White Paper No. 11 enhances <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> to the fifth basic competence in teacher education.
