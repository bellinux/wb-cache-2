Test {{results from this}} site have enabled a thorough evaluation of the impacts of future mercury regulations to Brayton Point Unit 1, including performance, estimated cost, and operation data. This unit has variable (29 - 75 %) native mercury removal, thus {{it was important to}} understand the impacts of process variables and activated carbon on mercury capture. The team responsible for executing this program included: (1) Plant and PG&E National Energy Group corporate personnel; (2) Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI); (3) United States Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL); (4) ADA-ES, Inc.; (5) NORIT Americas, Inc.; (6) Apogee Scientific, Inc.; (7) TRC Environmental Corporation; (8) URS Corporation; (9) Quinapoxet Solutions; (10) Energy and Environmental Strategies (EES); and (11) Reaction Engineering International (REI). The technical support of all of these entities came together to make this program achieve its goals. Overall, the objectives of this field test program were to determine the impact of activated carbon injection on mercury control and balance-of-plant processes on Brayton Point Unit 1. Brayton Point Unit 1 is a 250 -MW unit that fires a low-sulfur eastern bituminous coal. Particulate control is achieved by two electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) in series. The full-scale tests were conducted on one-half of the flue gas stream (nominally 125 MW). Mercury control sorbents were injected in between the two ESPs. The residence time from the injection grid to the second ESP was approximately 0. 5 seconds. In preparation for the full-scale tests, 12 different sorbents were evaluated in a slipstream of flue gas via a packed-bed field test apparatus for mercury adsorption. Results from these tests were used to determine the five carbon-based sorbents that were tested at full-scale. Conditions of interest that were varied included SO{sub 3 } conditioning on/off, injection concentrations, and distribution spray patterns. The original test plan called for parametric testing of NORIT FGD carbon at 1, 3, and 10 lbs/MMacf. These injection concentrations were estimated based on results from the Pleasant Prairie tests that showed no additional mercury removal when injection concentrations were increased above 10 lbs/MMacf. The Brayton Point parametric test data indicated that higher injection concentrations would achieve higher removal efficiencies and should be tested. The test plan was altered to include testing at 20 lbs/MMacf. The first test at this higher rate showed very high removal across the second ESP (> 80 %). Unlike the ''ceiling'' phenomenon witnessed at Pleasant Prairie, increasing sorbent <b>injection</b> <b>concentration</b> resulted in further capture of vapor-phase mercury. The final phase of field-testing was a 10 -day period of continuous injection of NORIT FGD carbon. During the first five days, the <b>injection</b> <b>concentration</b> was held at 10 lbs/MMacf, followed by nominally five days of testing at an <b>injection</b> <b>concentration</b> of 20 lbs/MMacf. The mercury removal, as measured by the semi-continuous emission monitors (S-CEM), varied between 78 % and 95 % during the 10 lbs/MMacf period and increased to > 97 % when the <b>injection</b> <b>concentration</b> was increased to 20 lbs/MMacf. During the long-term testing period, mercury measurements following EPA's draft Ontario Hydro method were conducted by TRC Environmental Corporation at both 10 and 20 lbs/MMacf test conditions. The Ontario Hydro data showed that the particulate mercury removal was similar between the two conditions of 10 or 20 lbs/MMacf and removal efficiencies were greater than 99 %. Elemental mercury was not detected in any samples, so no conclusions as to its removal can be drawn. Removal of oxidized mercury, on the other hand, increased from 68 % to 93 % with the higher <b>injection</b> <b>concentration.</b> These removal rates agreed well with the S-CEM results...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{remained}} oil in {{the reservoir}} after conventional water-flooding processes, forms a dispersed phase {{in the form of}} oil drops which is trapped by capillary forces and is almost about 70 % of the original {{oil in the}} place (OOIP). To reduce oil residual saturation in laboratory experiments and field projects, surfactant flooding is effective via decreasing the interfacial tension mobility ratio between oil and water phases. Estimation of the role of design variables, like chemical concentrations, partition coefficient and injection rate in different performance quantities, considering a heterogeneous and multiphase oil reservoir is a critical stage for optimal design. Increasing demand for oil production from water-flooded reservoirs has caused an increasing interest in surfactant-polymer (SP) and alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP). Modeling minimizes the risk of high cost of chemicals by improving our insight of process. In the present paper, a surfactant compositional flood model for a three-component (water, petroleum and surfactant), two phase (aqueous and oleic) system is studied. A homogeneous, two-dimensional, isothermal reservoir with no free gas or alkali is assumed. The governing equations are in three categories: the continuity equations for the transport of each component, Darcy's equation for the transport of each phase and other auxiliary equations. The equations are solved by finite-differences using a procedure implicit in pressure and explicit in saturation. The validation of the model is achieved through comparing the modeling results with CMG simulators and Buckley–Leverett theory. The results of modeling showed good agreement with CMG results, and the comparison with Buckley–Leverett theory is explained according to different assumptions. After validation of the model, in order to investigate sensitivity analysis, the effects of system variables (partition coefficient, surface tension, oil viscosity and surface <b>injection</b> <b>concentration)</b> and performance variable (cumulative oil recovery) are studied. Finally, the comparison of oil recovery between water-flooding and surfactant-flooding was done. The results showed higher oil recovery with changes in capillary number when the partition coefficient is greater than unity. Increasing oil viscosity resulted in decreasing the oil recovery by changing in fractional flow. Moreover, it was concluded that the oil recovery was enhanced by increasing surfactant <b>injection</b> <b>concentration.</b> The oil recovery was increased when surfactant was injected to the system and this result was obtained by comparing water-flooding and surfactant-flooding...|$|E

However, such parameters are difficult to estimate because of the inaccessibility {{and complexity of the}} subsurface. In this regard, developments in parameter estimation techniques and investigations of field experiments are still challenging and necessary to improve our understanding and the prediction of hydrological processes.

The aim of this study was to identify these factors. DesignA review of a prospectively collected database of UGFS which commenced in July 2007. MethodsA successful outcome was defined as complete occlusion of the target vein on duplex scanning at follow-up. Eight factors were assessed to determine whether they were associated with outcomes and complications. These factors were age, gender, compliance with post-procedure compression hosiery, previous varicose vein surgery, single or multiple sites of <b>injection,</b> <b>concentration</b> of sclerosant, volume of sclerosant and pre-procedure severity score. ResultsBetween July 2007 and July 2009, a total of 126 patients (60 men, 66 women) attended follow-up visits and had a post-procedure duplex scan. Targets for UGFS included the great saphenous vein (n =  75), small saphenous vein (n =  13) and anterior accessory great saphenous vein (n =  8). The remainder of procedures involved other veins or more than a single target vein. The median timing of follow-up was 3 months (range 1. 5 – 14 months) with duplex scans revealing complete occlusion of the target vein in 79 % of patients. The only factor associated with a successful outcome was compliance with post-procedure compression hosiery (p <  0. 05).

40|$|PG&E NEG Salem Harbor Station Unit 1 was {{successfully}} tested for applicability of activated carbon injection as a mercury control technology. Test {{results from this}} site have enabled a thorough evaluation of mercury control at Salem Harbor Unit 1, including performance, estimated cost, and operation data. This unit has very high native mercury removal, thus {{it was important to}} understand the impacts of process variables on native mercury capture. The team responsible for executing this program included plant and PG&E headquarters personnel, EPRI and several of its member companies, DOE, ADA, Norit Americas, Inc., Hamon Research-Cottrell, Apogee Scientific, TRC Environmental Corporation, Reaction Engineering, as well as other laboratories. The technical support of all of these entities came together to make this program achieve its goals. Overall the objectives of this field test program were to determine the mercury control and balance-of-plant impacts resulting from activated carbon injection into a full-scale ESP on Salem Harbor Unit 1, a low sulfur bituminous-coal-fired 86 MW unit. It was also important to understand the impacts of process variables on native mercury removal (> 85 %). One half of the gas stream was used for these tests, or 43 MWe. Activated carbon, DARCO FGD supplied by NORIT Americas, was injected upstream of the cold side ESP, just downstream of the air preheater. This allowed for approximately 1. 5 seconds residence time in the duct before entering the ESP. Conditions tested in this field evaluation included the impacts of the Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system on mercury capture, of unburned carbon in the fly ash, of adjusting ESP inlet flue gas temperatures, and of boiler load on mercury control. The field evaluation conducted at Salem Harbor looked at several sorbent injection concentrations at several flue gas temperatures. It was noted that at the mid temperature range of 322 - 327 F, the LOI (unburned carbon) lost some of its ability to capture vapor phase Hg, however activated carbon performed relatively well. At the normal operating temperatures of 298 - 306 F, mercury emissions from the ESP were so low that both particulate and elemental mercury were ''not detected'' at the detection limits of the Ontario Hydro method for both baseline and injection tests. The oxidized mercury however, was 95 % lower at a sorbent <b>injection</b> <b>concentration</b> of 10 lbs/MMacf compared with baseline emissions. When the flue gas temperatures were increased to a range of 343 - 347 F, mercury removal efficiencies were limited to < 25 %, even at the same sorbent <b>injection</b> <b>concentration.</b> Other tests examined the impacts of fly ash LOI, operation of the SNCR system, and flue gas temperature on the native mercury capture without sorbent injection. Listed below are the main conclusions from this program: (1) SNCR on/off test showed no beneficial effect on mercury removal caused by the SNCR system. (2) At standard operating temperatures ({approx} 300 F), reducing LOI from 30 - 35 % to 15 - 20 % had minimal impact on Hg removal. (3) Increasing flue gas temperatures reduced Hg removal regardless of LOI concentrations at Salem Harbor (minimum LOI was 15 %). Native mercury removal started to fall off at temperatures above 320 F. ACI effectiveness for mercury removal fell off at temperatures above 340 F. (4) Test method detection limits play an important role at Salem Harbor due to the low residual emissions. Examining the proposed MA rule, both the removal efficiency and the emission concentrations will be difficult to demonstrate on an ongoing basis. (5) Under tested conditions the baseline emissions met the proposed removal efficiency for 2006, but not the proposed emission concentration. ACI can meet the more-stringent 2012 emission limits, as long as measurement detection limits are lower than the Ontario Hydro method. SCEM testing was able to verify the low emissions. For ACI to perform at this level, process conditions need to match those obtained during testing...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hypogonadism {{is one of}} {{the most}} common male {{endocrine}} problems. Although many treatments are currently available, unmet need exists for new testosterone (T) replacement therapies that are simple to administer and use, are safe, and mimic physiologic T levels. Aim: The study aim was to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of T enanthate (TE) administered via a novel single‐use autoinjector system, which was designed to eject high‐viscosity solutions from a prefilled syringe fitted with a five‐eighths‐inch 27 ‐gauge needle. Methods: Thirty‐nine men with hypogonadism entered this dose‐finding, open‐label, parallel‐group study. Patients were washed out of their topical T regimens and randomized to receive 50 or 100 [*]mg of subcutaneous (SC) TE weekly. The reference group were patients with hypogonadism who were maintained on standard 200 ‐mg intramuscular (IM) TE. Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure was the PK profile of SC TE, analyzed in reference to T levels used by the Food and Drug Administration to approve T products. Secondary outcome measures were safety and tolerability assessments. Results: Both doses of SC TE achieved normal average concentrations of serum T within a 168 ‐h dosing interval after <b>injection.</b> <b>Concentration</b> ranges were similar at all time points following 50 ‐mg SC TE injections and following the third injection in the 100 ‐mg arm. Mean steady‐state T concentration at week 6 was 422. 4 and 895. 5 [*]ng/dL for the 50 ‐ and 100 ‐mg SC TE arms, respectively. SC TE demonstrated PK dose proportionality. SC TE restored normal serum T with low variation relative to 200 ‐mg IM without clinically significant adverse events. Conclusions: Administration of TE via this novel injection system restored T levels to normal range in men with hypogonadism. SC TE dosed weekly demonstrated steady, dose‐proportional measures of exposure and was well‐tolerated. Kaminetsky J, Jaffe JS, Swerdloff RS.
