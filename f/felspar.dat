These spheres are disposed in layers parallel to the foliation of the gneiss: and are the result of a metamorphic action of great intensity, effecting a complete rearrangement and crystallization of the quartz and mica in parallel planes, whilst the <b>felspar</b> is aggregated in spheres; just as in the rearrangement of the mineral constituents of mica-schists, the alumina is crystallized in the garnets, and in the clay-slates the iron into pyrites.|$|E
40|$|Identification {{of natural}} alkali <b>felspars</b> with X-ray powder photographs. X-ray powder {{analysis}} {{is becoming an}} important tool for the petrographer when identification problems {{can not be solved}} with the usual optical and chemical methods. It is the aim of this paper to provide data to identify alkali <b>felspars</b> in groundmasses of extrusive rocks, perthites and other fine grained structures. Moreover the variation of the intensities and the position of spacings of the powder patterns of natural alkali <b>felspars</b> is compared with the variation in optical properties and chemical composition. To this purpose alkali <b>felspars</b> of different localities, chemical composition, crystallization temperature and rate of cooling are investigated with optical methods, X-ray powder analysis and as far as possible, chemical analysis. The optical examination of the alkali <b>felspars</b> was made with the four axes universal stage. The position of the poles of crystallographic elements and twinning axes was determined with respect to the axes of the indicatrix N 0 ̆ 3 b 1, N 0 ̆ 3 b 2, N 0 ̆ 3 b 3. The co-ordinates are recorded according to Nikitin (1936). The quadrant in which each pole is situated is indicated by the sign + or —. In plate III the measurements on the potash-soda <b>felspars</b> are plotted in a projection normal to N 0 ̆ 3 b 21. The interpretation normal orthoclase-Naorthoclase was made with the aid of the co-ordinates given by Nikitin (partly reproduced in table I) who did not give a chemical definition of these terms.

40|$|Crystal size {{distributions}} (CSDs) {{studies of}} igneous rocks allow the quantification of sizes of mineral {{and contribute to}} a better understanding of crystallization conditions. Since most CSD studies have been made on mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and mafic plutonic rocks, one of the goals of this research was to do a large number of CSDs on feldspar crystals from two well-known granitic localities: the Eurajoki stock (Finland) and the South Mountain Batholith (Nova Scotia, Canada). Crystal size data were measured at different scales and on different media (outcrop, rock slabs and thin sections). CSDs were constructed from the data collected at the various scales using the program CSD corrections and plotted as amalgamated CSDs for each sample. CSDs of potassic <b>felspars</b> from Eurajoki samples were curved upwards and the characteristic lengths indicate three populations of crystals sizes. It is proposed that potassic feldspar crystals have been texturally coarsened likely because the Eurajoki melts were emplaced in a hot environment. This minimized undercooling and the temperature was buffered by latent heat of fusion near the liquidus. Thus large crystals grew at the expense of smaller ones. With cooling, nucleation and growth of small crystals resumed, yielding the different crystals sizes populations observed. CSDs of plagioclase and potassic <b>felspars</b> from the South Mountain Batholith were also curved upwards and the characteristic lengths indicate two populations of crystals sizes, except for the muscovite leucogranites from the stage 2 plutons, where CSDs are straight. Textural coarsening formed the larger crystals, megacrysts, in the South Mountain Batholith. Here the constant ascent of new magma into the plutons slowed undercooling and buffered the temperature producing the right conditions for textural coarsening...|$|R

40|$|Petrographic and granulometric {{analyses}} of North Queensland beach sediments indicate their affinity with sediments {{delivered to the}} coast by rivers, and it is shown that the beaches are largely derived from fluvial sediment reworked, sorted and distributed by the dominant south-easterly waves in coastal waters. Beach sediments are generally quartzose, with subordinate <b>felspars</b> and admixtures of coralline sediment near fringing reefs and lithic material near river mouths and rocky shore sectors. The prevailing northerly drift of shore sediment is reduced, and locally reversed, on sectors sheltered from the dominant south-easterly waves by headlands, reefs and islands. Variations in beach sediment are related to wave conditions, distance from river-mouth sources, and patterns of drift. Four Mile Beach, near Port Douglas, is identified as anomalous in its morphological and sedimentological characteristics.

The plagioclase <b>felspars</b> are described with special reference to the variation of grain-size, the features of zoned crystals, and the possible causes of a peculiar brown clouding in the basic zones of the crystals. Phenocrysts of augite and pigeonite, as well as plagioclase are recorded in the chilled contact rock. The micrometric data indicate that the mineral composition of the specimens is largely governed by the oxidation state of the iron, and that the Soret effect has caused the marginal rock to be enriched in basic elements. Hydrothermal veinlets composed largely of chlorite occur in both the dolorite and the country rock, and evidence suggests that veins of both residual material and mobilised granite occur in the upper finer-grained dolorite...|$|R

Sometimes our way lay close to the black precipices on our right, under which the snow was deep; and we dragged ourselves along, grasping every prominence of the rock with our numbed fingers. Granite appeared in large veins in the crumpled gneiss at a great elevation, in its most beautiful and loosely-crystallised form, of pearly white prisms of <b>felspar,</b> glassy quartz, and milk-white flat plates of mica, with occasionally large crystals of tourmaline. Garnets were very frequent in the gneiss near the granite veins.

The walls of the opposite bank were strikingly perpendicular; in some places stratified, in others solid and polished by the course of stream and cascade. The principal material was a granite, so coarse, that the composing mica, quartz, and <b>felspar</b> separated into detached pieces as large as a man's thumb; micaceous grit, which glittered in the sunbeams, and various sandstones, abounded.

40|$|Abstract [...] The present paper {{presents}} the mineralogical composition of sediments from the Spanish Wealdian facies, selected from four stratigraphic sections of several {{regions in the}} Southern Cordillera Iberica. Three of these sections show an irregular alternation of kaolinite rich sandy and silty-clay beds. The fourth section which contains calcareous layers, is very important from a geological point of view, because it is located where the structures of two ranges, the Iberian and the Betics, converge. The clays of about 80 samples from these sections always consist of illite, kaolinite and interstratified clay minerals. The sandy layers also Contain quartz, as well as potash and calcic-sodic <b>felspars.</b> The fine fraction (< 2 #m) is composed of kaolinte, between pM and T types, swelling illite and randomly interstratified clay minerals of the t~) pe (10 r 14 ~), richer in 10 A layers. From the mineralogical and crystalchemical data and field observations, it is deduced that these sediments are mainly detrital. This and the layer alternation suggest, for the Upper Jurasic and Lower Cretaceous (Wealdian facies), a clim te alternating from biostatic torhexistatic. Alternating laterization and erosion might supply the materials to the Wealdian sedimentary basin. INTRODUCI'ION The Spanish Wealdian, first discussed by Gonzale...|$|R

(Ceramics) The {{research}} project attempts {{to fill a}} void by assembling data dealing with a comprehensive range of South African clay and glaze materials, suited {{to the needs of}} the studio potter, and recording test results. South African kaolins, ball clays, fireclays, miscellaneous clays, grogs, bentonites, felspathic materials, alkaline earths, silica, refractory materials (other than clays) and mineral pigments are dealt with. A limited selection of foreign materials, frequently referred to in studio-potter publications, was also used in comparative tests. The materials are recorded with reference to the ultimate analysis, seger formula, proximate analysis (where applicable), properties and results of trials using the materials in clay bodies and/or glazes. It was demonstrated that South African materials are largely of good quality e. g. kaolin, <b>felspars</b> and silica. Variability of clay supplies because of lack of stockpiling and blending practices, especially by small suppliers, is often a problem. When the composition of glaze materials and trials indicated that imported equivalents were superior because of variability of local supplies or poor grade material, then substitutes were tested using South African materials. Basic clay bodies and glazes covering a wide temperature range from Egyptian Paste, low-fired wares such as raku, terracotta-and-white-earthenwares, stoneware and soft-porcelain bodies and glazes are dealt with giving a brief outline of the requirements for each type.

40|$|High Purity Quartz {{is one of}} the {{important}} minerals in the electronic industry today, but production of extreme high purity quartz requires a detailed knowledge of the resource from mine to the processing plant. To achieve this, a detailed study of fed materials to the plants is required. Studies have shown that quartz can be contaminated with some minerals that need to be traced and removed so as to obtain high purity quartz as possible (at least 99. 998 % pure quartz). The common contaminant minerals are plagioclase, alkali <b>felspars,</b> biotite, muscovite, almandine-spessartine garnet, epidote, apatite, zircon, rutile, Ce-rich allanite and xenonite. These minerals may occur as micro inclusions in quartz and thus cause contaminations of Ca, Fe,Mn, P, Zr, Th, U Al, Na, Ca, K, TiO 2, REE(Ce,Y), etc. Crushing and flotation are important stages towards quartz liberation from other minerals, but crushing is effective to a certain fraction size. In this study we investigated the crushed and floated Quartz samples with the following mesh sizes: 325, 200, 140, 100, 70, 50 and 40. Light microscopy, XRD, XRF, SEM and EPMA analysis were used. The results revealed that quartz liberation is maximum at 100 - 200 mesh.

40|$|Mercury MESSENGER aims {{to map the}} {{composition}} of the Mercurian crust. This composition has direct implications for the formation and evolution of the planet (Solomon, 2003). The instruments that will compositionally map the surface are calibrated and compared with materials in an Earth-like environment. However, minerals on the surface of Mercury are periodically exposed to the solar wind (radiation) while being heated to over 700 K and cooled to below 100 K daily (Madey et al., 1998; Hale and Hapke, 2002). To understand how these effects will change interpretations of spectra taken from MESSENGER and to understand interactions between the space environment and the crust we are simulating the space-weathering environment on minerals we expect to find on the surface of Mercury. We irradiate with fast neutrons and/or heat the low-iron minerals anorthoclase feldspar, enstatite orthopyroxene, and diopside clinopyroxene. Our results indicate that sodium rich feldspars have the potential to contribute sodium to the exosphere, but in order to to produce potassium from the surface, more potassium rich <b>felspars</b> may be necessary. Calcium and magnesium are released from diopside clinopyroxene while enstatite orthopyroxene is relatively unaffected by weathering. This may indicate that there is more clinopyroxene on the surface of Mercury than orthopyroxene in areas correlating to calcium and magnesium source regions. The variable space weathering effects between minerals may have important consequences in the exosphere. In addition, we also observe interactions between these processes which may help explain small scale patterns of exospheric species on Mercury. We stress the need to create spectral libraries that reflect space weathering environments of materials. by Stephanie Marie Brown. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A {{study of}} the southerly {{occurrence}} of Auborus sediments revealed a basal conglomerate varying in thickness from 100 ft. to 3300 ft. and lying unconformably on an undulating base of lavas and sediments of the Sinclair Formation. This is overlain by variable thicknesses of sandstone which contain a few interbedded conglomerate bands, {{most of which are}} wedge-shaped. Intercalated grit is present in both the sandstone and the conglomerate zones. Shale occurs in the north-west where the sediments reach a thickness of 8500 ft. Nama sediments overlie the formation unconformably. Deposition, after rapid erosion and decay, took place under warm humid conditions into a shallow, slowly subsiding, intracratonic basin. Inward dipping edges were produced by contemporaneous subsidence. Vertical post-depositional movements in the central section folded the beds of the whole succession in the west into vertical and overturned positions. Block faulting that followed had a meridional trend and elevated this central section. Roughly north-trending faulting has displaced the contact in the south-east, and two later sets of east-west faults occur in the north-east. Diagonal, release and tension joints were revealed by measurement. Fracture planes in conglomerate pebbles apparently show no relationship to nearby faults. Pebble, cobble and boulder conglomerates contain a great variety of rock types, which have mostly been identified as coming from nearby southerly sources. A matrix is always present. The sandstone is a uniform red colour, very fine-grained, well sorted, very well compacted and is felspathic and arkosic in character. Rock fragments are ubiquitous. The colouring matter is intergranular, crystalline hematite. <b>Felspars</b> and biotite show various stages of alteration. A little recrystallization of quartz has taken place. The main heavy minerals are ore (largely specularite), garnet, epidote, zoisite, clinozoisite, mica, monazite, zircon and tourmaline. Zircon has been classified on colour, roundness, inclusions and zoning; tourmaline on colour, roundness and inclusions. Bedding in the sands tone is from thin to laminated. The commonest sedimentary structures are cross-beds, mud cracks and clay-pellet impressions. Other features are ripple marks, parting lineations, flute casts and rain prints. The red colour was probably produced in the source area. Diagenetic processes have produced spots of decoloration; and some joints show decoloration.

The latter are predominantly of sandy character, but may show locally high contents of muddy material, especially in sheltered bays. The tidal flats consist for the greater part of sand. Slightly muddy sand is often encountered along the high tide lines and very muddy deposits, dissected by small ebb gullies, are frequently present along the sides of the channels. The marshes are usually composed of comparatively clayey deposits, which are cut through by creeks. Details are given concerning the morphology of these sub-zones, and on the processes of erosion and sedimentation, which are responsible both for the morphology and for the composition of the sediments. The chapter is based on own observations (most of them published before) and on the results of a great number of other investigators (see list of references). Ch. II. The chief sediments in the Wadden Sea are (1) sands, (2) mud and clay, (3) shell beds. “True” hard rock gravels are very rare. They occur in the vicinity of outcrops of older, psephitic deposits (glacial till). Special mention is made of the formation of gravelly sediments, composed of small, limonitic clay-rhizo-concretions (found at the base of marsh cliffs and in the mass of the marsh deposits themselves). Granulometrical analyses of Wadden sediments have been carried out by a number of authors. Several conclusions may be drawn from their work: The Wadden sands are rarely pure, but contain mostly a certain amount of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc; the average grain size of the sands decreases usually from the tidal inlets inwards; the material which has been transported in suspension, most of the time, shows a remarkably uniform grain size distribution along the whole length of the Dutch coast (Doeglas, Favejee, Hissink, Zuur) etc. Ch. III. The investigated sediments are mainly composed of psammitic and pelitic, elements of the following minerals: quartz, carbonates, micas and clay minerals, <b>felspars,</b> glauconites and heavy minerals. The quartz percentages decrease with diminishing of the grain size of the material under consideration. Micas and clay minerals show an increase in this same direction. Grains of carbonates and <b>felspars</b> have their maximum distribution in the siltfractions. From the heavy mineral composition of the Wadden Sea sands it may be deduced that the greater part of the material has been brought in from the North Sea, via the tidal inlets (Crommelin). The same conclusion is reached with regard to the silt fractions (Crommelin) and the clay material (Favejee). Ch. IV. The organic matter of the Wadden Sea sediments is partly derived from older peat beds which have been eroded; for another part it is produced by plants and animals living in the Wadden Sea area itself. The basic organic materials, required for the growth of the latter organisms, are probably chiefly supplied out of the North Sea (Verwey). The organic content of the Wadden Sea sediments may show a decrease from the surface downwards, at least in the first few decimeters. This is presumably due to decomposition, under the influence of bacterial activities, by enzymes and by purely chemical processes. A notable parallelism is observed between the percentage variations of the organic matter and those of the material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc. Ch. V. A close relation exists also between the percentages of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc and the iron content. This element is present in various authigenous compounds: Hydroxides of iron are found in marsh deposits (above the ground water table) and in the uppermost few millimeters or centimeters of the tidal flat and channel sediments. FeS. nH 2 O is formed in anaerobic environment, under the surface of the tidal flats and the channel floors. This substance tends to take up additional sulphur, thereby changing into pyrite. The pyrite is normally distributed in very small elements. Comparatively large, more or less globular aggregates of pyrite crystals (up to 40 0 ̆ 3 bc diameter) are seen in brackish water sediments. The transformation of iron hydroxides into monosulphuric compounds takes place in a short time. That of the FeS. nH 2 O into FeS 2 requires at least half a century. Where the vertical accretion has been continuous, a gradual change in colour is observed between the deep black monosulphuric sediments just below the surface and the greyish, pyritic material at greater depths. Ch. VI. The major part of the calcium carbonate material is (primarily) formed by calcareous organisms (foraminifera, echinoderms, molluscs etc.). A minor amount may have originated in other ways, e. g. by bacterial activities and by chemical processes. A relation is found between the increase of the carbonate percentages and the amounts of material < 16 0 ̆ 3 bc. A maximum is reached in the fraction 2 — 16 ft. Marsh sediments are subject to decalcification processes. The velocity of the solution of the carbonates depends on many factors, which require still further investigation. No decalcification phenomena are known from the normal tidal flat and channel floor sediments in the Netherlands. They have been observed, however, in the Basin of Arcachon (France). It is thought that the solution in this area is caused, at least to an important extent, by organic acids, produced during the decomposition of the large masses of dead Zostera remains, which are embedded in the sediments. Ch. VII. Considerable quantities of silica are formed on the surface of the tidal flats by the skeletons of (living) benthonic diatoms. The numbers of dead skeletons which are encountered in the tidal flat deposits themselves are, however, mostly very small. In the marsh sediments a more normal relation seems to exist between the amounts of skeletons of living and of buried diatoms. It is supposed that, after the death of the organisms, a solution or at least a beginning peptization of the silica takes place, which is swifter in the tidal flat environment than in the marsh deposits, probably in consequence of the higher alkalinity. The relatively coarse and less soluble skeletons of a part of the planktonic diatoms are of much more even distribution and are found in all Wadden Sea sediments. Other sources of locally formed silica are: radiolarians, sponges and plants. Ch. VIII. This chapter gives some conclusions, to be drawn from the study of thin sections of Wadden Sea sediments and of various deposits formed in more brackish water environment. The minimum grain size of separate sand (and silt) laminae is about 40 0 ̆ 3 bc in the former and down to at least 20 0 ̆ 3 bc in the latter. The parallel orientation of mica flakes and clay minerals is often much more pronounced in brackish (and fresh) water muds than in muds of Wadden Sea origin. Another conclusion, following from thin section analysis, is that brackish water deposits often show a coating of the sand grains, which may be due to peptization of clay material. Ch. IX. Useful evidence regarding the circumstances of sediment formation can be gathered from the structures as seen in undisturbed core samples. Several types of laminations are described. The laminae of channel floor- and tidal flat deposits have comparatively even, smooth upper and lower sides. The sand may show current or wave ripple structures. The laminae are of a sublenticular character and cannot be traced over great horizontal distances. The marsh laminations are characterized by the somewhat undulating, nodular aspect of the lamiae. The structures of beach deposits differ from the channel floor- and tidal flat laminations in that their laminae are more strictly parallel (apart from ripple mark structures). Another difference between these two laminations is that the latter are normally free of mud material. The finest laminations, with the thinnest laminae, are found in (some) brackish water deposits. The laminations and other primary oppositional structures may be disturbed by secondary influences: the burrowing of bottom dwelling organisms, the penetration of the sediment by plant roots etc. The effect of the burrowing animals is in general most pronounced on the highest parts of the tidal flats, where the sedimentation tends to be slow, but continuous. A sharp limit is often found between the disturbed deposits of the high tidal flats and the overlying marsh sediments, the lower parts of which are scarcely inhabited by bottom dwelling animals at all. Among the other structures, which are dealt with in this chapter, special mention may be made of the fissures, developed in mud beds under a permanent cover of water. Some new data are presented concerning their distribution and character, but no satisfactory conclusion about the manner of their formation is reached. Ch. X. The sediment properties, described in the foregoing chapters, are summarized and arranged according to their distribution in the various environments of formation...|$|R
40|$|The tin- bearing granites in the State of Goias, Brazil, form {{two groups}} of {{different}} ages: 1770 My for the Sucuri and Soledade massifs, 1658 - 1614 My. for the Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa and Serra Branca massifs. The geology of the province suggests that these granites were emplaced in a rift context. The Sucuri and Soledade massifs are emplaced in gneisses of Archean age, the others massifs are intrusive in the Serra da Mesa Group, a sedimentary formation composed of pelites and greywackes. This Group was metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies (kyanite- almandine- biotite paragenesis). According to several thermobarometric tools, the temperature was around 540 °C and the pressure between 5 and 7 kBar. The age of the sediments {{is supposed to be}} lower Proterozoic, in accordance with the age proposed for the Serra Dourada massif (1653 My [...] The Serra Dourada massif is composed of four rock types. The petrographic, mineralogic observations and geochemical data reveal a main trend, composed of an amphibole- bearing facies, a biotite- bearing facies, and a fine grained porphyritic facies.. Garnet- bearing granites do not show any relations with the main trend. The contents of these granites in Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La, Ga, and their MgO/TiO 2 ratio (around 1) {{are similar to those of}} the anorogenic granites of South Western United States and Gabo suite of Australia. However, niobium shows a compatible behaviour in Serra Dourada, in contrast to its incompatible behaviour in many anorogenic granites [...] . // [...] . The compositional variations of the beryllium minerals observed in skarns may be explained by the following processes : -either a late arrival of silica- rich solutions (high Si/Al ratio, presence of phenacite or helvite) within early formed alumina- rich parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl), - or a limited mobility of Al relatively to Si, which would induce a limited extension of the aluminous parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl). The activity of aluminum plays an essential role in the stability of the beryllium minerals : phenacite and/or helvite are stable when it is low, and beryl, chrysoberyl or musgravite when it is high. However, the increase of activity of other elements (Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, alkalis) that would induce the formation of minerals incorporating alumina (garnet or <b>felspars)</b> would be unfavourable to the formation of beryl. Helvite is thus typically stable in calcic skarns, and it is associated with phenacite in the rocks submitted to alkaline metasomatism. Beryl, on the contrary, normally appears when acidic fluids separates from highly evolved granitic magmas (aplopegmatitic stage). The zonation of helvite crystals in albitites (genthelvite core, danalite border) reflects the decrease of alkalinity of the fluids. This zonation on the crystal scale is also observed on the outcrop scale: helvite composition varies from Ge 64 Da 10 He 26 in the internal zone to Ge 23 Da 50 He 26, in the external zone. The same variation is observed in an albitized siderophyllite vein, from Ge 25 Da 42 He 33 in a slightly albitized zone to Ge 55 Da 39 He 22 in a highly albitized one. The formation of genthelvite is favoured, as compared with the other members of the helvite group, by alkaline conditions. The compositional variations of helvite in the Sucuri massif would result from variations in fs 2 and f 02, in the fluids. Genthelvite is stable under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. Les granites stannifères de l'état de Goias forment deux groupes d'âge different. Les massifs de Sucuri et de Soledade ont un âge de 1770 Ma et les massifs de Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa et Serra Branca ont respectivement 1653, 1614 et 1658 Ma. La géologie de cette province conduit à situer la mise en place de ces granites dans la zone de Rift. Les éléments traces Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La et Ga et le rapport MgO/TiO 2 sont comparables à ceux des granites anorogéniques du sud-ouest des Etats-Unis et de la suite de Gabo en Australie. Les valeurs faibles du rapport Zr/Hf (23 à 28) des massifs étudiés permettent d'exclure une origine directe par fusion partielle, le rapport crustal par fusion est compris entre 30 et 40. La zonalité minéralogique (bordure à biotite et coeur à pyroxène) des lentilles à pyroxène du gisement de Mata Azul (massif de Serra Dourada) traduit le caractère métasomatique de ces roches et rappelle celles des endoskarns. Les études pétrographiques, minéralogiques et géochimiques ont mis en évidence l'importance du rôle du calcium et de la fugacité d'oxygène. A l'exception des albitites, la majorité des zones métasomatiques et les veines minéralisées sont localisées dans la partie apicale du granite fin au nord du massif de Sucuri. Les minéraux du béryllium (béryl, phénacite et helvite) sont présents dans la veine à quartz-muscovite, dans la veine à sidérophyllite. dans l'albitite, seules la phénacite et l'helvite sont présentes. Les variations de composition des minéraux de l'helvite dans le massif de Sucuri résulteraient des variations de la fugacité de soufre et de celle de l'oxygène et de l'alcalinité à l'intérieur du fluide...|$|R
