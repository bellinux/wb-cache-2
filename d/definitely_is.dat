25|$|Let me {{assure you}} that King's work most <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> literature, because it was written to be {{published}} and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means {{is that it is}} not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.|$|E
25|$|A {{person does}} not have to have each of these, but if {{something}} has all five then it <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> a person whether it is biologically human or not, while if it has none or perhaps only one then it is not a person, again whether it is biologically human or not. The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is not a person.|$|E
25|$|Abueva was {{not able}} to suit up in Alaska's first three {{assignments}} as he still needed to finish his duties with his school in the NCAA. In his highly anticipated debut game, Abueva made an immediate impact as he came through with a beastly performance against the Petron Blaze Boosters. Still smarting from his alma mater's NCAA final four loss to Letran 4 days before, he showed that he <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> ready for the big leagues, finishing with 12 points and 16 rebounds in just 27 minutes.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that as a {{consequence}} of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary reports {{indicate}} that bufotenine-containing toad venom {{has been used as}} a street drug; that is, as a supposed aphrodisiac (it is not an aphrodisiac but <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> a lethal poison), ingested orally in the form of ch’an su, and as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting Bufo toad venom or dried Bufo skins. The use of chan'su and love stone (a related toad venom preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the West Indies) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death. The practice of orally ingesting toad venom has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention. Albert Most, founder of the Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of spiritual use of Bufo alvarius venom, published a booklet titled Bufo alvarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert in 1983 which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions.|$|E

International producer Christian de Walden praised Geronimo's voice and said [...] "The personality {{of her voice}} is phenomenally distinct.

She <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> the biggest talent I have come across within the last ten years...". Her voice is very clean and neat but powerful and mid-belt.|$|E

About the album, Steve Kilbey commented, [...] "This is The Church's water record. I've always marveled at the seas, rivers, and rain. It wasn't conscious at all, but on reflection, it <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> a preoccupation on this record." [...] The band toured North American in September and October before returning home to Australia for a string of dates in November and December.|$|E

2500|$|Tribadism is {{a common}} sexual {{practice}} among women {{who have sex with}} women (WSW). Although the term tribadism is often applied to the act of vulva-to-vulva stimulation, it encompasses a variety of sexual activity. In addition to the scissoring position, which involves the partners interlocking their legs in a position similar to the shape of scissors and pressing their vulvas together, tribadism may involve a missionary position, a woman on top position, a doggy style position or others, or simple movement of the woman's vulva against her partner's thigh, stomach, buttocks, arm, or another body part. Vaginal penetration by use of the fingers or by use of a dildo may be accompanied, and so sometimes [...] "mutuality and reciprocation tend not to be the main objective, although satisfaction for both partners through different means most <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> its aim". Women who enjoy or prefer tribadism report finding pleasure from its allowance of whole-body contact, the experience of timing hip movement and feeling their partner's motions without manual stimulation, which is considered exciting, erotic and a much easier way to achieve orgasm due to ample clitoral stimulation.|$|E
60|$|Let us here {{remark that}} it was exactly what strikes us as the desperate absurdity of the {{assumptions}} of the Social Contract, which constituted the power of that work, when it accidentally fell {{into the hands of}} men who surveyed a national system wrecked in all its parts. The Social Contract is worked out precisely in that fashion which, if it touches men at all, makes them into fanatics. Long trains of reasoning, careful allegation of proofs, patient admission on every hand of qualifying propositions and multitudinous limitations, are essential to science, and produce treatises that guide the wise statesman in normal times. But it is dogma that gives fervour to a sect. There are always large classes of minds to whom anything {{in the shape of a}} vigorously compact system is irresistibly fascinating, and to whom the qualification of a proposition, or the limitation of a theoretic principle is distressing or intolerable. Such persons always come to the front for a season in times of distraction, when the party that knows its own aims most <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> sure to have the best chance of obtaining power. And Rousseau's method charmed their temperament. A man who handles sets of complex facts is necessarily slow-footed, but one who has only words to deal with, may advance with a speed, a precision, a consistency, a conclusiveness, that has a magical potency over men who insist on having politics and theology drawn out in exact theorems like those of Euclid.|$|E
