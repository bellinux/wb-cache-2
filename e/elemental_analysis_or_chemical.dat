The (P,S) donor ligands having one or two o -thiomethoxyphenyl groups, preferred bidentate coordination mode, while the (P,O) donor ligands, having one, two or three o -methoxyphenyls, formed monodentate phosphorus bound complexes. Steric and electronic parameters affecting the coordination chemistry of the phosphanes are discussed for the monodentate complexes. In the second part, triphenylphosphane and 2 - and 4 -pyridyldiphenylphosphane substituted tungsten tetracarbonyl derivatives was prepared, and attractive intramolecular interactions between the phosphane ligands were studied for both the neutral and the protonated complexes. Hydrogen bonding, π -stacking and cation-π bonding interactions were established, and observed to influence the cis/trans isomerism of the complexes. Cis/trans isomerism could be tuned by protonation, and deprotonation of the pyridyldiphenylphosphane derivatives.

As a high-performance T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cell tracking label, the GNTs are gadolinium-loaded carbon nanotube capsules that render MSCs magnetic when internalized. MSCs were internally labeled with either superparamagnetic GNTs or colloidal diamagnetic lutetium (Lu). In vitro cell rolling assays and ex vivo cardiac perfusion experiments qualitatively demonstrated increased magnetic-assisted retention of GNT-labeled MSCs.

To investigate the role of this activity further, we purified the enzyme from rat insulinoma tissue by gel-filtration chromatography and affinity elution from p-aminobenzoyl-arginine. A yield of 42 %, with a purification factor of 674 over the homogenate, was achieved. Analysis of the purified carboxypeptidase by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis under either reducing or non-reducing conditions showed {{it to be a}} monomeric protein of apparent Mr 55, 000.

Amino acid <b>analysis</b> <b>or</b> <b>chemical</b> deglycosylation and SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated a protein Mr of 50, 000, suggesting a carbohydrate content of approx. 9 % by weight. The purified enzyme was able to remove basic amino acids from the C-terminus of proinsulin tryptic peptides to generate insulin, but did not further degrade the mature hormone. It was inhibited by EDTA, 1, 10 -phenanthroline and guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, and stimulated 5 -fold by CoCl 2. The pH optimum of the conversion of diarginyl-insulin into insulin was in the range 5 - 6, with little activity above pH 6. 5. Activity was also expressed towards a dansylated tripeptide substrate (dansyl-phenylalanyl-leucyl-arginine; Km = 17. 5 microM), and had a pH optimum of 5. 5. These properties are indistinguishable from those of the activity located in secretory granules, and are compatible with the intragranular environment.
