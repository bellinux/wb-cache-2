25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} {{can be used}} {{as guides}} in developing <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> methods. Since the goal of much education is behavioural change, the understanding of behaviour afforded by behavioural change theories provides insight into the formulation of <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioural change. In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses, the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioural change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design.|$|E

25|$|By 2015, {{there has}} been a major {{improvement}} of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> methods enabled teachers and students {{for the first time to}} teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders.|$|E

25|$|Second, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development involves understanding how cognitive change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. Education also capitalizes on cognitive change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> methods that would move the student from a lower {{to a higher level}} of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{believed}} that <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> {{must be based}} on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of rote learning and punitive discipline in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.|$|E

He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children's Television Workshop, the series' non-profit producer. The Muppets were {{a crucial part of}} the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> tools because children easily recognized them, they were predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.|$|E

500|$|Humor {{was used}} on Sesame Street to both attract the {{attention}} of its young viewers and to, as Lesser put it, [...] "entice parents and older siblings to share the young child's viewing", called [...] "coviewing" [...] by Truglio and Fisch. [...] Jim Henson's characters and humor were instrumental in creating the show's [...] "two-tiered audience" [...] of younger and older viewers. [...] Lesser {{went so far as to}} state that educational television was [...] "completely dependent upon the effective use of humor". Lesser also stated that in order for comedy to be an <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> tool, it had to coincide with the lesson being taught. [...] Although critics complained that slapstick was too violent for children's television, the Workshop found that it was the most effective comedy form they used, and as Lesser said, [...] "a favorite with preschoolers". Morrow reported that the only violence depicted on Sesame Street was [...] "slapstick punctuation", and that it was used only in animations and short films.|$|E

500|$|Animation {{was another}} {{important}} aspect of the structure of Sesame Street. Lesser stated that one of the purposes of animation was to create incongruity, or what he called [...] "illogical surprises". [...] The first piece of animation commissioned by the CTW for Sesame Street was [...] "the J commercial", in 1968, which they used in a study about its effectiveness in daycare centers in New York City. The CTW found that it was an effective tool in teaching children letters and numbers and that it effectively attracted children's attention. It also provided evidence, as writer Robert W. Morrow reported, that children were able to [...] "endure enormous amounts of repetition". According to Morrow, the CTW's generalization from this study, which was later supported by outside studies, was that although repetition was an <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> method, repeated exposure [...] "determined instructional effectiveness". [...] "The J commercial" [...] was a part of CTW's promotional film about Sesame Street and was used to demonstrate its teaching style to the press.|$|E
500|$|Repetition was a {{convention}} used often on Sesame Street. The creators understood that repetition gave young children opportunities to practice new skills and assisted them {{in making a}} connection between new and unfamiliar concepts. They observed that children seemed to enjoy some material more after viewing them several times, and allowed them to predict and anticipate {{the outcome of a}} sequence. Repetition made it easier to teach complex concepts or situations a child {{would not be able to}} comprehend from a single viewing, and allowed children to explore different facets of a subject. [...] In the early years of Sesame Street, the producers took advantage of repetition as an <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> tool by often repeating the same segment many times during the course of an episode; in the first ten seasons, one in six segments was a repeat of an earlier one. The Workshop also learned that varying the details while repeating the same format was also an effective use of repetition.|$|E
500|$|Jim Henson and the Muppets' {{involvement}} in Sesame Street {{began when he}} and Cooney met {{at one of the}} curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should [...] "make do without puppets". Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join Sesame Street to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take [...] "arcane academic goals" [...] and translate them to [...] "effective and pleasurable viewing". In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were <b>effective</b> <b>teaching</b> tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.|$|E

According to economist and professor, Dr. Jesse M.

[...] The issue of possible bias {{with the use of}} value added measures {{has been the subject of}} considerable recent study, and other researchers reach the conclusion that value added measures do provide good estimates of teacher effectiveness.

2500|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is {{sponsoring}} a multi-year study of value-added modeling with their Measures of <b>Effective</b> <b>Teaching</b> program. [...] Initial results, released in December 2010, indicate that both value-added modeling and student perception of several key teacher traits, such as {{control of the}} classroom and challenging students with rigorous work, correctly identify effective teachers. [...] The study about student evaluations was done by Ronald Ferguson. [...] The study also discovered that teachers who teach to the test are much less effective, and have significantly lower value-added modeling scores, than teachers who promote a deep conceptual understanding of the full curriculum. Reanalysis of the MET report’s results conducted by Jesse Rothstein, an economist and professor at University of California, Berkeley, dispute some of these interpretations, however. Rothstein argues that the analyses in the report do not support the conclusions, and that [...] "interpreted correctly... undermine rather than validate value-added-based approaches to teacher evaluation.” [...] More recent work from the MET project, however, validates the use of value added approaches.|$|E
