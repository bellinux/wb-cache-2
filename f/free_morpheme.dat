25|$|A {{compound}} {{is a word}} {{composed of}} more than one <b>free</b> <b>morpheme.</b> The English language, like many others, uses compounds frequently. English compounds may be classified in several ways, such as the word classes or the semantic relationship of their components.|$|E
2500|$|In compositionally polysynthetic languages, there usually can be {{more than}} one <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> per word, which gives rise to noun {{incorporation}} and verb serialisation to create extremely long words. [...] Bound affixes, though less important in compositionally polysynthetic languages than in affixally polysynthetic languages, tend to be equally abundant in both types.|$|E
50|$|In morphology, a bound {{morpheme}} is a morpheme that appears only {{as part of}} a larger word; a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> or un{{bound morpheme}} is one that can stand alone or can appear with other lexemes. A bound morpheme is also known as a bound form, and similarly a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> is a free form.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{roots are}} <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> (ship- in [...] "shipment"), {{and others are}} bound. Roots {{normally}} carry lexical meaning. Words like chairman that contain two <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> (chair and man) {{are referred to as}} compound words.|$|R
5000|$|Object pronouns are <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> and occur after verbs {{and certain}} [...] "case-marking prepositions" [...] as seen below.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Free</b> <b>morphemes</b> can {{function}} independently as words (e.g. town, dog) and can appear within lexemes (e.g. town hall, doghouse).|$|R
50|$|The {{definite}} marker is {{also not}} consistent in the jysk dialects. In the west, where only one gender is present, {{as well as all}} of SydJy and SønJy the definite marker is a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> that comes before the noun. It is not, however, the same as the <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> found in standard Danish when an adjective precedes a noun. It is phonetically realised as æ.|$|E
50|$|Independent {{meaningful}} {{units are}} free morphemes. These are elemental words. <b>Free</b> <b>morpheme</b> can stand alone as a word without help of another morpheme. It {{does not need}} anything attached to it to make a word.|$|E

5000|$|Function <b>morphemes</b> can be <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> {{that are}} prepositions, pronouns, determiners, and conjunctions. Additionally, {{they can be}} bound morphemes that are inflectional affixes.|$|R
50|$|In compositionally polysynthetic languages, there usually can be {{more than}} one <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> per word, which gives rise to noun {{incorporation}} and verb serialisation to create extremely long words. Bound affixes, though less important in compositionally polysynthetic languages than in affixally polysynthetic languages, tend to be equally abundant in both types.|$|E
50|$|The {{indirect}} possessor form is {{used for}} alienably possessed nouns. It occurs as a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> preceding the possessed noun. There are two categories distinguished - 'oral consumable' and 'general'. The oral consumable category includes items {{that are able to}} be eaten, drunk, or consumed via the mouth, such as tobacco (Unger, 2008:42).|$|E
5000|$|Cranberry {{morpheme}}s are {{a special}} form of bound morpheme whose independent meaning has been displaced and serves only to distinguish one word from another, like in cranberry, {{in which the}} <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> berry is preceded by the bound morpheme cran-, meaning [...] "crane" [...] from the earlier name for the berry, [...] "crane berry".|$|E
5000|$|Content <b>morphemes</b> include <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> {{that are}} nouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs. It also {{includes}} bound morphemes that are bound roots and derivational affixes.|$|R
50|$|In {{a complex}} <b>morpheme,</b> {{multiple}} <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> are combined {{to form a}} word and impart meaning. More than one Stem Morphemes create a complex morpheme.|$|R
2500|$|Simple clitics are <b>free</b> <b>morphemes,</b> {{meaning they}} can stand {{alone in a}} phrase or sentence. They are unaccented and thus phonologically {{dependent}} upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this [...] "host".|$|R
50|$|The basic word schema is as follows: root-(affixes)-inflection-(enclitic). Below is {{an example}} from Central Siberian Yupik. There are {{a total of three}} affixes {{internal}} to the word 'angyagh.' The root (or <b>free</b> <b>morpheme)</b> 'angyagh' and the inflection '-tuq' on the right consist of the indicative mood marker plus third person singular. The enclitic -lu ‘also’ follows the inflection.|$|E
5000|$|English: [...] "He {{travelled}} by hovercraft on the sea" [...] {{is largely}} isolating, but travelled (although {{it is possible}} to say [...] "did travel" [...] instead) and hovercraft each have two morphemes per word, the former being an example of relational synthesis (inflection), and the latter of compounding synthesis (a special case of derivation with another <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> instead of a bound one).|$|E
5000|$|Particularly in {{the study}} of Semitic languages, a suffix is called an afformative, as they can alter the form of the words. In Indo-European studies, a {{distinction}} is made between suffixes and endings. A word-final segment that is somewhere between a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> and a bound morpheme is known as a suffixoid or a semi-suffix (e.g., English -like or German -freundlich friendly).Bold text ...|$|E
40|$|Compounding is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} word formation process in Technical English. Flexibility in compounding and {{the ease with which}} it can be applied to express complex meanings and concepts make compounds a great favorite in Technical English. Compounding is a process whereby two <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> are combined as one word. They differ from both derivational and inflectional affixation as they are the exclusive amalgamation of two <b>free</b> <b>morphemes.</b> For instance, the form „black box‟, consisting of two <b>free</b> <b>morphemes,</b> may be interpreted as a box that is black in colour, but the concept borne by the compound, blackbox, points out to the fluorescent orange colour box fitted in the aeroplanes to explore the history of any mishap during emergencies. In the word rainbow, there are two individual morphemes „rain ‟ and „bow ‟ to mean two different things, when these are not combined. However, the combination of these two words gives a new dimension to the words, rain and bow, by associating a new meaning to it...|$|R
50|$|In Odia morphology, {{there are}} no {{adjective}} and adverb inflections like the comparative (-er) and superlative (-est) of English language. Instead, bound morphemes like /ଠାରୁ/ and /ରୁ/, and <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> like /ତୁଳନାରେ/ etc. are used.|$|R
50|$|The <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> carry a fixed meaning {{while the}} bound morphemes exhibit large scale {{variations}} in meanings. The variable and changing {{meanings of the}} bound morphemes impart diversity to word meanings and enrich the language.|$|R
50|$|The verb suffix -suru in Yilan Creole, {{derived from}} the Japanese verb ‘to do’, is similar to its Japanese counterpart, except {{in that it is}} a bound {{morpheme}} while the Japanese -suru can stand alone as a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme.</b> Also, Yilan Creole -suru can attach to nouns, adjectives, and, among young generational speakers, verbs. However, older generation speakers do not accept verbs + -suru combinations.|$|E
5000|$|Morphemes {{differ from}} words in that many morphemes {{may not be}} able to stand alone. The Sprint name is {{composed}} of a single word and a single morpheme. Conversely, a brand like Acuvue is composed of two morphemes, each with a distinct meaning. While [...] "vue" [...] may be able to stand as its own word, [...] "acu" [...] is seen as a prefix or a bound morpheme that must connect to a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> like [...] "vue." ...|$|E
50|$|Every word {{must have}} only one root (<b>free</b> <b>morpheme)</b> always at the beginning. Eskimo-Aleut {{languages}} have {{a relatively small number}} of roots: in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik, around two thousand. Following the root are a number of postbases, which are bound morphemes that add to the basic meaning of the root. If the meaning of the postbase is to be expressed alone, a special neutral root (in the case of Central Alaskan Yup'ik and Inuktitut pi) is used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} and span of rules of morphemes {{in a language}} depend on the [...] "morphology" [...] in that particular language. In a language having greater morphology, a word would have an internal compositional structure in terms of word-pieces (i.e. <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> - Bases) and those would also possess bound morphemes like affixes. Such a morpheme-rich language is termed as synthetic language. To the contrary, an isolating language uses independent words and in turn, the words lack internal structure. A synthetic language tends to employ affixes and internal modification of roots (i.e. <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> - Bases) for the same purpose of expressing additional meanings.|$|R
25|$|Because {{they possess}} {{a greater number}} of <b>free</b> <b>morphemes,</b> compositionally polysynthetic {{languages}} are much more prone than affixally polysynthetic ones to evolve into simpler languages with less complex words. On the other hand, they are generally easier to distinguish from non-polysynthetic languages than affixally polysynthetic languages.|$|R
40|$|Cross-linguistically, the {{grammatical}} categories tense, aspect, and modality - {{when they}} are overtly expressed - are generally realized by <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> (such as adverbials and auxiliaries) or by bound inflectional markers. The discussion in this chapter will make clear that this generalization also holds true for sign languages. It will be shown that tense is generally encoded by time adverbials and only occasionally (and only in a few sign languages) by verbal inflection. In contrast, various aspect types are realized on the lexical verb, in particular, by characteristic movement modulations. Only completive/perfective aspect is commonly realized by <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> across sign languages. Finally, deontic and epistemic modality is usually encoded by dedicated modal verbs. In relation to all three grammatical categories, the possibility of (additional) non-manual marking {{and the issue of}} grammaticalization will also be addresse...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{of these}} bilingual Chinese {{dictionaries}} cross-reference lang and gan to langgan, {{but a few}} translate lang and gan independently. In terms of Chinese word morphology, láng 琅 is a <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> that can appear alone (for instance, a surname) or in other compound words (such as fàláng 琺琅 [...] "enamel" [...] and Lángyá shān 琅琊山 [...] "Mount Langya (Anhui)") while gān 玕 is a bound morpheme that only occurs in the compound lánggān and does not have independent meaning.|$|E
50|$|Languages {{that show}} number {{inflection}} {{for a large}} enough corpus of nouns or allow them to combine directly with singular and plural numerals {{can be described as}} non-classifier languages. On the other hand, there are languages that obligatorily require a counter word or the so-called classifier for all nouns. For example, the category of number in Assamese is fused with the category of classifier, which always carries a definite/indefinite reading. The singularity or plurality of the noun is determined by the addition of the classifier suffix either to the noun or to the numeral. Number system in Assamese is either realized as numeral or as nominal inflection, but not both. Numerals ek 'one' and dui 'two', can be realized as both <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> and clitics. When used with classifiers, these two numerals are cliticised to the classifiers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of a separate <b>free</b> <b>morpheme</b> definite marker in the western Jysk dialects æ has come to cause a contrastive semantic meaning difference with the standard Danish dem. Nouns that can be analyzed as mass nouns, as opposed to count nouns can take the æ article before an adjective. If the noun is, however, {{meant to be a}} count noun it uses the standard Danish plural article dem. An example of this would be dem små kartofler versus æ små kartofler 'the small potatoes'. dem små kartofler refers to the small potatoes in a set, i.e. those 5 small potatoes on the table. æ små kartofler refers instead to a mass noun, meaning potatoes that are generally small. It is like saying [...] "the yellow potatoes" [...] in English. It can either mean yellow potatoes as a whole, a mass noun or the yellow potatoes sitting on the table, as opposed to the red ones.|$|E
50|$|Note that derivational affixes {{are bound}} morphemes - they are {{meaningful}} units, but can only normally occur when attached to another word. In that respect, derivation differs from compounding by which <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> are combined (lawsuit, Latin professor). It also differs from inflection in that inflection does not create new lexemes but new word forms (table → tables; open → opened).|$|R
50|$|Some languages, such as Japanese, Chinese and the Tai languages, have {{elaborate}} {{systems of}} particles {{that go with}} nouns based on shape and function, but are <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> rather than affixes. Because the classes defined by these classifying words are not generally distinguished in other contexts, there are many linguists who take the view {{that they do not}} create noun classes.|$|R
50|$|Trained in American {{structural}} linguistics, Yuen Ren Chao and Lien-sheng Yang wrote a Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1947), {{that emphasized}} the spoken {{rather than the}} written language. Main entries were listed in Gwoyeu Romatzyh, and they distinguished <b>free</b> <b>morphemes</b> from bound morphemes. A hint of non-standard pronunciation was also given, by marking final stops and initial voicing and non-palatalization in non-Mandarin dialects.|$|R
