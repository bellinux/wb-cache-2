5000|$|Motorcycle Stability Control (MSC) is a {{motorcycle}} <b>electronic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> system developed by Robert Bosch GmbH. It is a lean-sensitive {{variation of the}} traditional ABS system Anti-lock braking system. The MSC system uses accelerometers and/or gyroscopic sensors to evaluate how close to the limit of adhesion the motorcycle is cornering. It reduces the allowable braking tire slip ratio, reducing the braking force, thus preventing the tire skid, and keeping the motorcycle from falling into the turn, or low-siding.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{effectiveness}} of closed-loop <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> to reduce vehicle off-tracking arising from overspeeding in curves. When a driver enters a curve too fast given the available friction, {{the aim is to}} use <b>electronic</b> <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> to reduce speed and increase path curvature to complete the turn. Previously it has been found that coordinated four wheel braking referenced to an inertially fixed vehicle mass center acceleration (PPR) is an optimal control strategy. The present work introduces the effect of driver-vehicle interaction, using simulation and track experiments. It is confirmed that PPR effectiveness is not disrupted by typical steering corrections from the driver. PPR is found to offer significant path following improvements compared with other <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> strategies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{possibility}} of enhancing the performances of ABS (Antilock <b>Braking</b> System) /EBD (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Brake</b> Distribution) <b>control</b> system by using the additional information provided by “smart tires” (i. e. tires with embedded sensors and digital-computing capability). In particular, on the basis of previous works ([1]), the authors assumed that these components should be able to provide estimates for the normal loads acting on the four wheels and for the tire-road friction coefficient. The benefits produced by the introduction of these additional channels into the existing ABS/EBD control logic were evaluated through simulations carried out with a validated 14 dofs vehicle+ABS/EBD control logic numerical model. The performance of the ABS control system was evaluated through a series of braking maneuvers on straight track focusing the attention on -jump conditions, while the performance of the EBD control system was assessed by means of braking maneuvers carried out considering several weight distributions...|$|R

50|$|After {{receiving}} his Abitur, Wolfgang Ziebart studied {{mechanical engineering}} at the Technical University of Munich where he received his Diploma and PhD (Dr.-Ing.) in 1973 and 1976, respectively. Ziebart started his career in 1977 with the car manufacturer BMW. In 2000, Ziebart moved from BMW to the automobile supplier Continental AG. There he focussed on automotive electronics and was among other things was responsible for the development of <b>electronic</b> <b>brakes,</b> airbag and <b>control</b> systems. One year later he became deputy chairman of Continental AG's board. In September 2004 Ziebart joined Infineon Technologies AG where he was chairman of the board until his resignation on 26 May 2008. After a spell at Artega Automobile, a German electric sports car manufacturer, he joined Jaguar Land Rover as head of product development in 2013.|$|R

50|$|Subaru {{introduced}} {{improvements to}} the chassis that they call Dynamic Chassis Control Concept, which uses high-tensile steel in critical areas to achieve high strength with lighter weight. The front-end structure introduces Cradle Mount that isolates the suspension and engine from the passenger compartment for a smoother and quieter ride using rubber mounts. New for this generation is a double wishbone rear suspension, with all suspension links and the rear differential isolated from the rear subframe with large rubber mounts to minimize noise and vibration intruding into the passenger compartment. Subaru has also added safety technologies such as <b>Electronic</b> Stability <b>Control,</b> <b>Brake</b> Assist, and <b>Electronic</b> Brakeforce Distribution {{to the list of}} standard features.|$|R
5000|$|North America {{received}} only the 2.5-liter models. Released to the United States {{market for the}} 2008 model year, the model range consists of the 2.5i, the turbocharged WRX, and the Outback Sport that Subaru marketed as a separate model line. The naturally aspirated models are electronically limited from surpassing 190 km/h. For 2009, a new 2.5i GT trim arrived to the market with the turbocharged [...] engine from the 2008 model WRX (this 2009 WRX received a boost in power). While automatic transmission was not available with the WRX, the 2.5i GT did gain an optional four-speed automatic. In the Canadian market, the base Impreza 2.5i received upgrades for the 2009 model year, including rear disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>electronic</b> stability <b>control,</b> and body-colored door handles—features previously only found on the 2.5i Sport and more expensive trims.|$|R
50|$|All 4Runners {{came with}} Toyota's Star Safety System which {{includes}} anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> <b>electronic</b> brakeforce distribution, <b>brake</b> assist, traction <b>control</b> and Vehicle Stability Control. Side torso airbags {{for the front}} rows as well as side curtain airbags for {{the front and rear}} rows were optional on 2003-2007 models and became standard on 2008 models.|$|R
50|$|For the Captiva, the {{production}} {{version of the}} S3X, both five- or seven-seat configurations are available. Standard safety features include: anti-lock <b>brakes,</b> <b>electronic</b> stability <b>control</b> (ESC), front seatbelt pre-tensioners and force limiters, and driver and front passenger airbags. Side curtain airbags are standard on higher luxury level variants in some markets. In crash safety tests conducted by Euro NCAP, the Captiva was given a {{four out of five}} star crash rating. The results from the test were helped by the use of high-strength steel used in the body shell which was designed to spread crash forces over distinct load channels, therefore ensuring the safety of the occupants within the safety cell. The vehicle's optional active all-wheel drive system is fully incorporated with the ESC and anti-lock braking systems, consequently increasing car handling and control. When the vehicle detects a loss of traction, the all-wheel drive mode is activated automatically. In ordinary driving situations, only the vehicle's front wheels are employed.|$|R
