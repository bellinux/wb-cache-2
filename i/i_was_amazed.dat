Oliphant {{was one of the people}} who pushed the American program into motion. Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941 in an unheated bomber, ostensibly to discuss the radar-development program, but was assigned to find out why the United States was ignoring the findings of the MAUD Committee. He later recalled: [...] "the minutes and reports had been sent to Lyman Briggs, who was the Director of the Uranium Committee, and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment. I called on Briggs in Washington , only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> and distressed." ...|$|E

Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne, Tove Lo, and Sky Ferreira have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently {{been recognized as}} the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for [...] "subverting [...] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." [...] According to music journalist Maria Raha, [...] "Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." [...] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: [...] "I hate genderizing things... when I heard Hole, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> to hear a girl sing like that. Janis Joplin was her own thing; she was into Big Mama Thornton and Bessie Smith. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that." ...|$|E

I {{remember}} thinking that the sound of crackling bullets was just like hailstorm on a iron-roofed building, so you may guess what the fusillade was....A whole heap of men and horses went down twenty or thirty yards from the muzzles of the guns. The squadron broke into a few scattered horsemen at the guns and seemed to melt away completely.

[...] Reflecting on the U.S. relation with Egypt he said [...] "May God help us to get over this matter. A long time must pass before {{we will be able}} to forget this painful wound." [...] Outside Egypt's Cario University thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans clashed with police – at least 30 were injured and dozens arrested. Some demonstrators called for Mubarak's assassination.|$|E

2500|$|Britain was at war {{and felt}} {{an atomic bomb}} should have the highest priority, {{especially}} because the Germans might soon have one; but the US was not at war {{at that time and}} many Americans did not want to get involved.

[...] …I was called in to be interrogated three or four times during the next two years. Each time, it was the same setting, and the same set of questions. Each time I was unceremoniously marched out of class, in front of the instructor and all my classmates, by a uniformed policeman. Once this occurred during a final exam in accounting. [...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> that, while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E

I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked.
