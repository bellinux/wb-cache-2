By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career.

The reasons behind this were to keep them out of trouble and to help them <b>expand</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E

25|$|A host family {{volunteers to}} house {{a student from}} a {{different}} place during their exchange program visit. The family often doesn't receive any payment for hosting. Students are {{responsible for their own}} spending, including school fees, uniform, text books, internet, and phone calls. Host families could be family units with or without children or retired couples; most programs require one host to be at least 25 years of age. The host families are well prepared to experience a new culture and give a new cultural experience to the student. A student could live with more than one family in an exchange program to <b>expand</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> and experience more of the new culture. Host families are responsible for providing a room, meals, and a stable family environment for the student. Most exchange programs allow for a switch of hosts if problems arise.|$|E

2500|$|As {{it becomes}} {{increasingly}} difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of ecotourism which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to <b>expand</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of {{the plight of the}} people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as [...] "responsible tourism". There are many critiques of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.|$|E
2500|$|One other {{use that}} is being {{discussed}} {{is the use of}} social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to [...] "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to <b>expand</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become [...] "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} game theory models from the agent-based modeling perspective. We haveÂ discussed different Â classes ofÂ games such as Zero-sum, Perfect information, Bayesian, Congestion etc. We have alsoÂ  explored theÂ importance and nature of game theoryÂ by means of a novel taxonomy.Â The presentedÂ  taxonomy of game classes has beenÂ based on types of game representation. In the review, game theory applications in different fields has also been discussed. We believe that this review will help multidiscplinary researchers in <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the state-of-the-art in game theory. In particular, it will help researchers to look at game-theoreticÂ literature analyzed {{from the perspective of}} agents and complexity.|$|R
