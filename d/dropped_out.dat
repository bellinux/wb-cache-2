AIMS: To explore mental health treatment <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. METHOD: Representative face-to-face household surveys were conducted among adults in 24 countries. People who reported mental health treatment in the 12 months before interview (n = 8482) were asked about <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> defined as stopping treatment before the provider wanted. RESULTS: Overall, <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> was 31. 7 %: 26. 3 % in high-income countries, 45. 1 % in upper-middle-income countries, and 37. 6 % in low/lower-middle-income countries. <b>Drop</b> <b>out</b> from psychiatrists was 21. 3 % overall and similar across country income groups (high 20. 3 %, upper-middle 23. 6 %, low/lower-middle 23. 8 %) but the pattern of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> across other sectors differed by country income group. <b>Drop</b> <b>out</b> was more likely early in treatment, particularly after the second visit.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in-depth review {{and analysis of}} literature on <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> from school, and focuses on children who have gained access, but fail to complete a basic education cycle. The main discussion is around why and how children <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> from school. Here <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> is not presented as a distinct event, but rather a process where a range of supply-demand factors interact to influence schooling access. The paper looks at literature in relation to household, community and social contexts of <b>dropping</b> <b>out,</b> as well as school supply and practices. It also explores what research is saying around pre-cursors to <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> and factors which may influence retention.

40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>out</b> among school {{children}} {{especially at the}} basic school level has over the years gained the attention of many ministries of education, international organizations and scholars in the academia. It is said to inhabit threat to achieving universal primary education (UPE) everywhere, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To some recent studies, the phenomenon of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is said to be}} somewhat responsible for increased crime in some parts of Africa. It is the goal of this study to understand why students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school in Ghana and also what strategies there are to mitigate it. The study does so by comparing rural <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> to that of the urban as it carried out field work in four schools in five different communities. The study used the qualitative research approach to address what factors there were in causing children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school and what strategies are laid down by the government, better still the Ghana Education service in reducing <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data from the various stake holders- directors of education, circuit supervisors, head teachers, teachers, parents and most importantly the <b>drop</b> <b>outs</b> themselves. Such data was collected from the four schools in the five communities in both the rural and urban areas chosen for this study. The study investigated six factors as influencing <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among {{school children}} in the selected areas. It also identified both macro and micro- level strategies for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in the rural and urban schools. The study shows how the contextual differences of children, among others can influence their decision to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school. The study indicates that <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among school children in both rural and urban areas is predominantly caused by poverty, child labour, academic performance, pregnancy, corporal punishment (CP) and school context. The study makes clearer that such factors that cause children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school are not adequately independent but there are cases where one factor may coincide with the other to bring about <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> decision. It makes explicit that that the individual and institutional related factors of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> sometimes work in connection with one another culminating in <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Like it has been said earlier, macro and micro level strategies are found for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in rural and urban schools in Ghana. The macro strategies identified include, school feeding programme, free school uniform distribution and free education. The micro strategies include effective teaching, child safety, child friendly school environment, scholarship, guidance and counseling, introduction of kindergarten, role of NGOs, role of the family, communal by laws, among others.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student {{intention}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a concern}} for higher education institutions as well for their students. Students with the {{intention to}} <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> may eventually <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a sample of university students. Student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 501), and I have an intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 280). These two groups were enclosed as a dependent variable in the logistic regression. The variables included in the final model predicted between 13 % (Cox and Snell) and 18 % (Nagelkerke) of the variance in intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that self-esteem had an influence on student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Furthermore, it was found that cynicism and dedication have a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Lastly, lack of information about ways to obtain information also indicated a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Thus, it may be concluded that self-esteem, burnout and engagement and lack of information about ways of obtaining information have an influence on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Recommendations were made for practice as well as for future research.

40|$|Aim: {{this study}} {{reported}} various {{factors associated with}} a higher probability of HIV patients <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> and potential productivity loss due to HIV patients <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Methods: we analyzed data of 658 HIV patients from a database in a main referral hospital in Bandung city, West Java, Indonesia from 2007 to 2013. First, we utilized probit regression analysis and included, among others, the following variables: patients’ status (active or <b>drop</b> <b>out),</b> CD 4 cell count, TB and opportunistic infection (OI), work status, sex, history of injecting drugs, and support from family and peers. Second, we used the <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> data from our database and CD 4 cell count decline rate from another study to estimate the productivity loss due to HIV patients <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Results: lower CD 4 cell count {{was associated with a}} higher probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Support from family/peers, living with family, and diagnosed with TB were associated with lower probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The productivity loss at national level due to treatment <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (consequently, due to CD 4 cell count decline) can reach US$ 365 million (using average wage). Conclusion: first, as lower CD 4 cell count was associated with higher probability of <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> we recommend (to optimize) early ARV initiation at a higher CD 4 cell count, involving scaling up HIV service at the community level. Second, family/peer support should be further emphasized to further ensure treatment success. Third, <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> from ART will result in a relatively large productivity loss...|$|R
