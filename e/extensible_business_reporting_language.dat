Este artigo mostra o estado-da-arte do XBRL e como se deu sua evolução, bem como avalia o estágio atual do Brasil na divulgação de informações contábil-financeiras pela internet. Foi realizada uma pesquisa do tipo survey com empresas de capital aberto no Brasil. A pesquisa revelou uma forte aceitação do meio eletrônico para divulgação de informações financeiras e também que ainda é muito pequeno o conhecimento da linguagem XBRL no país e, conseqüentemente, menor ainda o número de entidades que já iniciaram formalmente os estudos para sua implementação. Mostrou ainda a inexistência de um padrão de divulgação de informações eletrônicas, tendo predominado os formatos PDF, HTML e DOC, o que dificulta a análise e comparação de informações entre órgãos reguladores e com o público em geral.

The major purpose of this research was to show XBRL state-of-the-art and its evolution, as well as to assess the current status of financial information dissemination on the internet in Brazil. Additionally, a survey with open capital companies in Brazil so as to detect the dissemination of financial statements on the internet was also carried out, focusing on the future expansion of XBRL use in the business environment. The research revealed a strong acceptance of the electronic media for dissemination of financial information, but that there is still very little knowledge of XBRL and that the number of institutions already studying the implementation of the language in the country is even smaller. It also showed the inexistence of a pattern of dissemination of electronic information; the prevailing formats were PDF, HTML and DOC, which hinders data analysis and comparison by regulatory agencies and by the general public...|$|R
40|$|In {{corporate}} reporting, greater internet use, reports {{available on}} the world wide web (WWW) and movements towards a more balanced reporting approach have become the most noticeable trends since the inception of sustainability reporting in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid en 2012. Directores de la Tesis: Ms. Beatriz Torvisco y Mr. Roberto GarcíaAccounting at the {{international}} level has become more changeable than never before due to several reasons, but one stands above the others: the convergence process carried out by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This process started in order to enhance the comparability of the financial statements worldwide, among other purposes, but also brought complexity and uncertainty about the temporal horizon and the degree of convergence that will be finally achieved. The only certainty that can be said about this process is that it will elongate throughout the following years and, due to its own complexity, the impairment of the comparability of the financial statements becomes a reality, as a non-desired effect. In the mean time, the advances achieved in the implementation of the electronic standard <b>eXtensible</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Report</b> <b>Language</b> (XBRL) bring to this context new possibilities, not yet foreseen to manage the financial information more efficiently, improving the decision-making process. Taking advantage {{from the fact that the}} financial statements are now written in this standard (XBRL), and applying technologies recently developed in the context of the Semantic Web, the present work proposes a new semantic-web-based approach that tries to overcome the limitations imposed by the changeable accounting regulation framework and its derived comparability impairments. Starting from XBRL statements (XML documents), the information is translated into RDF, so ontologies can be defined upon that information, taking advantage from the characteristics of Semantic Web technologies and over passing the limitations due to XBRL¿s underlying ones, more specifically those due to the fact it is based on XML.

Such a layout oriented data format however, {{does not seem to}} be sufficient any longer, especially in terms of content-syndication, harmonization, efficiencies, future ICT needs, stakeholders' expectations, and data exchange inside and outside companies, and no less important - in the light of approaching a European system for collecting, analyzing, and reporting environmental information (SEIS). In order to meet these challenges, a standardized reference architecture for sustainability reports built on the <b>eXtensible</b> <b>Businesses</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>Language</b> (XBRL) is proposed, and its underlying methodology is described.

Electronic questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used to survey Italian auditors’ interest and test the proposed framework. Data analysis was structured by adopting a multiple case approach.

40|$|Abstract. Standardization {{efforts in}} {{financial}} reporting {{have led to}} large numbers of machine-interpretable vocabularies that attempt to model complex accounting practices in XBRL (eXtended <b>Business</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>Language).</b> Because <b>reporting</b> agencies do not require fine-grained semantic and terminological representations, these vocabularies cannot be easily reused. Ontology-based Information Extraction, in particular, requires much greater semantic and terminological structure, {{and the introduction of}} a linguistic structure currently absent from XBRL. In order to facilitate such reuse, we propose a three-faceted methodology that analyzes and enriches the XBRL vocabulary: (1) transform semantic structure by analyzing the semantic relationships between terms (e. g. taxonomic, meronymic); (2) enhance terminological structure by using several domain-specific (XBRL), domain-related (SAPTerm, etc.) and domain-independent (GoogleDefine, Wikipedia, etc.) terminologies; and (3) add linguistic structure at term level (e. g. part-of-speech, morphology, syntactic arguments).

40|$|The XML <b>Business</b> <b>Reporting</b> <b>Language</b> (XBRL) is a {{standard}} for business and financial information reporting.

This makes more difficult to perform queries that mix information from filings from different dates, companies, or accounting principles than with a formalism based on a graph model instead of a tree model. Semantic Web technologies provide a graph model that facilitates mashing-up different XBRL sources. We have put into practice this approach mapping the XBRL filings available from the SEC’s EDGAR program to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the XML Schema taxonomies these filings are based on to Web Ontology Language (OWL).
