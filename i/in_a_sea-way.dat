6000|$|A {{cross swell}} {{had set in}} from the {{direction}} of Formosa Channel about ten o'clock, without disturbing these passengers much, because the Nan-Shan, with her flat bottom, rolling chocks on bilges, and great breadth of beam, had the reputation of an exceptionally steady ship <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way.</b> Mr. Jukes, in moments of expansion on shore, would proclaim loudly that the [...] "old girl was as good as she was pretty." [...] It would never have occurred to Captain MacWhirr to express his favourable opinion so loud or in terms so fanciful.|$|E
6000|$|A sudden thump on {{the outside}} of the door, {{followed}} by one mighty bark from each of the dogs, had made Magdalen start. [...] "Come in!" [...] shouted the admiral. The door opened; the tails of Brutus and Cassius cheerfully thumped the floor; and old Mazey marched straight up to the right-hand side of his master's chair. The veteran stood there, with his legs wide apart and his balance carefully adjusted, as if the dining-room had been a cabin, and the house a ship pitching <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way.</b>|$|E
60|$|Our mariners now {{measured}} {{their new}} frame. The keel was just four-and-twenty feet long, {{the distance between}} the knight-heads and the taffrail being six feet greater; the beam, from outside to outside, was nine feet, and the hold might be computed at five feet in depth. This gave something like a measurement of eleven tons; the pinnace having been intended for a craft a trifle smaller than this. As a vessel of eleven tons might make very good weather <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way,</b> if properly handled, the result gave great satisfaction, Mark cheering Bob with accounts of crafts, of much smaller dimensions, that had navigated the more stormy seas, with entire safety, on various occasions.|$|E
60|$|That {{decided the}} planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj rolled {{back to his}} {{inspection}} of the clearing. An elephant who will not work, and is not tied up, is not quite so manageable as an eighty-one ton gun loose <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>sea-way.</b> He slapped old friends {{on the back and}} asked them if the stumps were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning labour and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long 'nooning'; and wandering to and fro, thoroughly demoralised the garden until sundown, when he returned to his pickets for food.|$|R
60|$|Yet this frozen {{northern}} {{land and}} these forbidding seas have their history. Deeds were here done as great in valour as those {{which led to}} the conquest of a Mexico or the acquisition of a Peru. But unlike the captains and conquerors of the South, the explorers have {3} come and gone and left behind no trace of their passage. Their hopes of a land of gold, their vision of <b>a</b> new <b>sea-way</b> round the world, are among the forgotten dreams of the past. Robbed of its empty secret, the North still stretches silent and untenanted with nothing but the splendid record of human courage to illuminate its annals.|$|R
50|$|Several large (~3 meters) and {{advanced}} {{members of this}} group (Ctenospondylus, Sphenacodon, Secodontosaurus and Dimetrodon) are distinguished by a tall sail along the back, made up of elongated vertebral neural spines, which in life must have been covered with skin and blood vessels, and presumably functioned as a thermoregulatory device. However, possession of a sail {{does not appear to have}} been essential for these animals. For example, there is the case in which one genus (Sphenacodon - fossils known from New Mexico) lacks a sail, while a very similar and closely related genus (Dimetrodon - fossils known from Texas) has one. During the Permian, these two regions were separated by <b>a</b> narrow <b>sea-way,</b> but it is not clear why one geographically isolated group should evolve a sail, but the other group not.|$|R

'E seemed to cherish the 'ope that 'e might use the Gnome for 'is own 'orrible purposes; but what I told him about Mr. Jones's sad lack o' nerve comin' from Pompey, an' going dead slow {{on account of the}} dark, short-circuited that connection.

6000|$|The {{master of}} the Nan-Shan, {{speaking}} just audibly and gazing at his boots as his manner was, remarked {{that it would be}} necessary to call at Fu-chau this trip, and desired Mr. Rout to have steam up to-morrow afternoon at one o'clock sharp. He pushed back his hat to wipe his forehead, observing {{at the same time that}} he hated going ashore anyhow; while overtopping him Mr. Rout, without deigning a word, smoked austerely, nursing his right elbow in the palm of his left hand. Then Jukes was directed in the same subdued voice to keep the forward 'tween-deck clear of cargo. Two hundred coolies were going to be put down there. The Bun Hin Company were sending that lot home. Twenty-five bags of rice would be coming off in a sampan directly, for stores. All seven-years'-men they were, said Captain MacWhirr, with a camphor-wood chest to every man. The carpenter should be set to work nailing three-inch battens along the deck below, fore and aft, to keep these boxes from shifting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way.</b> Jukes had better look to it at once. [...] "D'ye hear, Jukes?" [...] This chinaman here was coming with the ship as far as Fu-chau--a sort of interpreter he would be. Bun Hin's clerk he was, and wanted to have a look at the space. Jukes had better take him forward. [...] "D'ye hear, Jukes?" ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} I have ever seen before a night so full of lights. The great change of sea life since my time was brought home to me. I had been {{conscious}} all day of an interminable procession of steamers. They {{went on and on}} as if in chase of each other, the Baltic trade, the trade of Scandinavia, of Denmark, of Germany, pitching heavily into a head sea and bound for the gateway of Dover Straits. Singly, and in small companies of two and three, they emerged from the dull, colourless, sunless distances ahead as if the supply of rather roughly finished mechanical toys were inexhaustible in some mysterious cheap store away there, below the grey curve of the earth. Cargo steam vessels have reached by this time a height of utilitarian ugliness which, when one reflects that it is the product of human ingenuity, strikes hopeless awe into one. These dismal creations look still uglier at sea than in port, and with an added touch of the ridiculous. Their rolling waddle when seen at a certain angle, their abrupt clockwork nodding <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way,</b> so unlike the soaring lift and swing of a craft under sail, have in them something caricatural, a suggestion of a low parody directed at noble predecessors by an improved generation of dull, mechanical toilers, conceited and without grace.|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} we tried out our rifles we put up our barbed wire railings. The Minota, crown-decked, without any house, and with a rail six inches high, was too {{accessible}} to boarders. So brass stanchions were screwed into the rail and a double row of barbed wire stretched around her from stem to stern and back again. Which was all very well as a protection from savages, but it was mighty uncomfortable to those on board when the Minota took to jumping and plunging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sea-way.</b> When one dislikes sliding down upon the lee- rail barbed wire, and when he dares not catch hold of the weather- rail barbed wire to save himself from sliding, and when, with these various disinclinations, he finds himself on a smooth flush-deck that is heeled over at an angle of forty-five degrees, some of the delights of Solomon Islands cruising may be comprehended. Also, it must be remembered, the penalty of a fall into the barbed wire {{is more than the}} mere scratches, for each scratch is practically certain to become a venomous ulcer. That caution will not save one from the wire was evidenced one fine morning when we were running along the Malaita coast with the breeze on our quarter. The wind was fresh, and a tidy sea was making. A black boy was at the wheel. Captain Jansen, Mr. Jacobsen (the mate), Charmian, and I had just sat down on deck to breakfast. Three unusually large seas caught us. The boy at the wheel lost his head. Three times the Minota was swept. The breakfast was rushed over the lee-rail. The knives and forks went through the scuppers; a boy aft went clean overboard and was dragged back; and our doughty skipper lay half inboard and half out, jammed in the barbed wire. After that, {{for the rest of the}} cruise, our joint use of the several remaining eating utensils was a splendid example of primitive communism. On the Eugenie, however, it was even worse, for we had but one teaspoon among four of us--but the Eugenie is another story.|$|E
