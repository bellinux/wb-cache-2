25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E

Could <b>we</b> determine some basic linguistic features of Afro-Romanic and, if yes, which ones? Which data are consistent with the presence of Berbers, Afro-Romanic speakers, in Al-Andalus? To what extent Afro-Romanic may have exerted an influence on Andalusi Romance? Which consequences this may have on the present knowledge of Iberian Romance languages? Some of the answers are striking and all of them deserve a closer revision into the origins of Ibero-Romance considering the latest data...|$|R

Is God real? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know?</b> Is there proof? So this fella, Cord Cooper, and I decided we needed to answer three basic questions in a very simple form, but I think substantively and really bares no rational refutation... We quote Einstein and Stephen Hawking, who is still living, the most brilliant man on the planet. As they say, it's inconceivable that all this has happened without a plan, without a blueprint, without some designer who created the design. So this book is so simple, yet I think profound truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer {{considered}} the standard philosophical question of other minds: <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> {{that other people}} have the same conscious experiences that we do? In his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: [...] "The only ground I can have for asserting that an object {{which appears to be}} conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which {{the presence or absence of}} consciousness is determined." [...] (This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence. Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.) In other words, a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} appears {{when there}} is no natural choice of elements from each set. [...] If we cannot make explicit choices, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that our set exists? [...] For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. [...] First we might try to proceed as if X were finite. [...] If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X. [...] Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. [...] But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x. [...] So this attempt also fails.|$|E

They‘re used to eating animals, like dogs, which are dependent on man, and so whenever they hear a human voice anywhere, they‘ll sneak right in and peep around, looking here and there. If there are no dogs, they won‘t stick around long and will slip away. But if they find a dog, they‘ll keep after it until they catch it. They‘ll sneak around it and lie in wait, {{and as soon as}} the dog is off its guard, they‘ll immediately pounce on it. This is the way leopards are. So they were in this monastery around every dwelling area. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>know?</b> Well, isn‘t this place swept so that it‘s spotless? Even if a mouse runs by, don‘t <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about it? And these were big cats, so how could we help but see their tracks?“ ...|$|R

At 11. 06 pm, on 6 September 2001, eighteen-year-old Shane stands {{near the house}} of his girlfriend's father, staring at the hilt of a sword stabbed into the ground. The next morning, his best friend Will {{is sitting in a}} police station, trying to explain the tangled relationship between him, Shane, and Shane's girlfriend Eileen. Ten years later, Eileen is living in a distant city under an assumed name. As she faces the tenth anniversary of the murder that re-defined her life, she is confronted by a young woman who claims to be the little sister that Eileen abandoned, all those years ago. And, on the morning of 7 September 2001, a failed teacher and father wakes up on his couch, unaware of what has transpired the night before and that he alone holds the key to these past and future events. <b>How</b> much <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about the people closest to us? <b>How</b> much <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about ourselves...|$|R
