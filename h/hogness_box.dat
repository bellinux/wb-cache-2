40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} 3 ' long terminal repeat and adjacent viral and host sequences was determined for a bovine leukemia provirus cloned from a bovine tumor. The long terminal repeat was found to comprise 535 nucleotides and to harbor at both ends an imperfect inverted repeat of 7 bases. Promoter-like sequences (<b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> and CAT box), an mRNA capping site, and a core enhancer-related sequence were tentatively located. No kinship was detected between this bovine leukemia proviral fragment and other retroviral long terminal repeats, including that of human T-cell leukemia virus.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} system [Weil, P. A., Luse, D. S., Segall, J. & Roeder, R. G. (1979) Cell 18, 469 - 484 and Manley, J. L., Fire, A., Cano, A., Sharp, P. A. & Gefter, M. L., (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 77, 3855 - 3859] was adapted for {{studying}} initiation of transcription of the ovalbumin gene. The DNA template was a cloned ovalbumin gene fragment that contained 5 ′ flanking sequences, the first structural sequence region, and {{a portion of}} the first intervening sequence. A HeLa cell crude extract was used as the source of RNA polymerase and initiation factors. Correct initiation was judged by the sizes of the transcription products generated from ovalbumin templates truncated at various positions before the 3 ′ end of the gene. Transcription of the specific product was carried out by RNA polymerase II, as judged from α-amanitin sensitivity. A series of deletion mutants was constructed by trimming 5 ′ flanking sequences of the ovalbumin DNA template by using exonuclease III. The DNAs generated were then cloned in pBR 322 and used as templates to determine which sequences were necessary for initiation of transcription. Specific initiation of the ovalbumin gene was unaffected by deletion of all but 61 nucleotides of the 5 ′ flanking sequence but completely abolished by deletion of all but 26 nucleotides of 5 ′ flanking sequence. Thus, a region between 61 and 26 nucleotides upstream from the cap site, which includes the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> (T-A-T-A-T-A-T) at position 32 - 26, is essential for the correct initiation of the ovalbumin gene. Nevertheless, natural DNA fragments containing false Hogness boxes (T-A-T-A-A-A-A and T-A-T-A-T-A-T) not normally located in the immediate 5 ′ flanking region of an authentic gene did not serve as promoters for initiation of transcription. These results suggest that the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> is essential, but not sufficient, for specific initiation of RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Cloned avian {{leukosis}} viral DNAs were mutagenized {{in the long}} terminal repeat, in the leader sequence for env mRNA, and at the poly-env junction. The effect of these mutations in the viral DNA upon its ability to direct virus production or env mRNA synthesis was analyzed by microinjecting the mutant DNAs into chicken embryo fibroblasts and into chicken cells transformed by the env-deficient Bryan strain of Rous sarcoma virus, respectively. The results indicated that: (i) addition of up to 8 base pairs 19 nucleotides upstream of the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> did not block transcription; (ii) deletion of 26 base pairs, including the tRNA primer binding site, allowed synthesis of all viral products and participation in recombination, but replication was blocked; (iii) deletion of fewer than 50 base pairs 250 bases downstream of the long terminal repeat depressed expression of all viral genes; and (iv) deletion {{of most of the}} gag and pol genes did not inhibit env mRNA synthesis, but virion packaging of the unspliced transcript was inefficient...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the complete primary structure (13 637 bp) of the TL-region of Agrobacterium tumefaciens octopine plasmid pTiAch 5. This sequence comprises two small direct repeats which flank the TL-region at each extremity and {{are involved in}} the transfer and/or integration of this DNA segment in plants. TL-DNA specifies eight open-reading frames corresponding to experimentally identified transcripts in crown gall tumor tissue. The eight coding regions are not interrupted by intervening sequences and are separated from each other by AT-rich regions. Potential transcriptional control signals upstream of the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of all the transcribed regions resemble typical eukaryotic signals: (i) transcriptional initiation signals ('TATA' or Goldberg- <b>Hogness</b> <b>box)</b> are present upstream to the presumed translational start codons; (ii) ' CCAAT ' sequences are present upstream of the proposed 'TATA' box; (iii) polyadenylation signals are present in the 3 '-untranslated regions. Furthermore, no Shine-Dalgarno sequences are present upstream of the presumed translational start codons...|$|E
40|$|The entire {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} long terminal repeat (LTR) of baboon endogenous virus (BaEV) M 7 was determined, which consisted of 554 base pairs (bp). At {{both ends of the}} LTR, 13 bp sequences, AAATGAAAAGTAA and TGATTCTAACATC, were detected to be inverted repeats. The structure with these inverted repeats resembles those of other retroviruses and transposable elements. a <b>Hogness</b> <b>box,</b> TATAAAA, and a putative poly(A) -addition signal, AGTAAA, were present within the right-hand half of the LTR, where the initiation and termination of the viral RNA synthesis seems to occur in the integrated BaEV genome. The primer-binding site of at least 14 bp long was found just outside of the LTR where the strong stop DNA started, and the primer for reverse transcription in BaEV seemed to be tRNAPro. Several structural features are commonly detected in the LTRs of BaEV and other retroviruses. Our studies suggest that BaEV has evolved from a common ancestor with other mammalian type C viruses. Close relationships between BaEV and a feline endogenous virus, RD 114, are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|We have sequenced five {{different}} rainbow trout protamine genes plus their flanking regions. The genes are not clustered {{and do not}} contain intervening sequences. There is an extremely high degree of sequence conservation in the coding and 3 ' untranslated regions of the gene. Downstream sequences exhibit little homology though conserved regions are found 250 base pairs 3 ' to the gene. There are four regions upstream of the gene that are highly conserved in the six clones, including the canonical Goldberg - <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> which is 45 base pairs 5 ' to the coding region. A second homologous region is found 90 bases upstream. Although in the same approximate location as the CAAT box found upstream of other genes, it does not contain the canonical CAAT sequence. Further upstream of the protamine genes at - 115 there is an A-T rich sequence while a 25 base pair conserved sequence is located 150 bases upstream. In addition we report {{the presence of a}} potential Z-DNA region of predominantly A-C repeats approximately one kilobase downstream of one of the genes...|$|E
40|$|Long {{terminal}} repeats (LTRs) of {{two members}} of mdg 1 family were sequenced. In the both cases, they are represented by perfect direct repeats 442 and 444 bp in length. Sixteen nucleotides in the LTRs of two different mdg 1 elements are different. Each LTR contains slightly mismatched 16 -nucleotide inverted repeats located {{at the ends of}} the LTR. Six base pairs closest to the termini of LTR form perfect inverted repeats. On the gene-distal sides of LTRs, short 4 -nucleotide direct repeats are located, probably representing the duplication of a target DNA sequence arising from insertion of mdg. They are different in the two cases analyzed. Just as the other analyzed eukaryotic transposable elements, mdg 1 starts with TGT and ends with ACA. Within the both strands of LTR, the sequences similar to <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> (a putative signal for RNA initiation, or a selector) and AATAAA blocks (putative polyadenylation signals) are present. The LTR of mdg 1 contains many short direct and inverted repetitive sequences. These include a 10 -nucleotide sequence forming a perfect direct repeat with the first ten nucleotides of the LTR. A region of LTR about 70 bp long is represented by simple repetitive sequences (TAT) ...|$|E
40|$|A clone {{containing}} the entire goat epsilon V beta-globin gene, which lies downstream {{from the two}} tandemly duplicated four-gene sets {{containing the}} beta C and beta A genes in the linkage group 5 '-epsilon I-epsilon II-psi beta X-beta C-epsilon III-epsilon IV-psi beta Z-beta A-epsilon V- 3 ', was isolated, and the sequence of the gene was determined. epsilon V is most homologous to the first gene {{in each of these}} sets, epsilon I and epsilon III, and appears to be a third duplicated copy of these genes, possibly the first gene in a third four-gene set. Homology of epsilon V to epsilon I is very high (93. 2 %) in coding regions, and all transcription, processing, and potential translation consensus sequence elements appear to be present, although the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> of epsilon V is altered compared with that of epsilon I by the deletion of an A(AATAAAA [...] AATAAA). Nevertheless, epsilon V is clearly a pseudogene as a result of two deletions and one insertion (or insertion-deletion) in its coding sequence, the first of which produces an in-frame stop codon at amino acid 54. Unlike the more highly mutated goat beta-like pseudogene duplicates psi beta X and psi beta Z, epsilon V acquired its defects after the duplication event in which it was created. Its recently acquired defects have left the epsilon V promoter sufficiently conserved to retain transcriptional activity in vitro. The acquisition of defects by this gene {{may be related to the}} multiple gene duplications which have created at least five epsilon type genes in the goat beta-globin locus...|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{thymidine}} kinase-negative (TK-) L {{cells were}} transformed with concatenates of cloned {{herpes simplex virus}} 1 TK DNA and different rabbit beta-globin DNAs in which the globin genes were preceded by native flanking sequences of 14, 66, 76, 425, and 1500 nucleotides. l In all cases, selection for TK+ cell lines led to a high yield of lines producing 5 - 1500 mature rabbit beta-globin-specific RNA strands per cell. The 5 ' termini of the transcripts mapped to (i) the "cap" nucleotide, (ii) positions 42 to 48 nucleotides downstream from the cap site, or (iii) positions in the vector DNA preceding the gene. In {{the case of the}} gene with only 14 base pairs of 5 ' flanking sequence, a high level of rabbit beta-globin RNA was produced, but none of the transcripts had the correct 5 ' end; most of them originated in the vector moiety. With 66 base pairs of 5 ' flanking sequence, 5 % of the 5 ' termini were correct, and with 76 or more base pairs, 30 - 85 % were correct. The region between 14 and 66 base pairs preceding the cap site contains the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> and appears to be essential for correct initiation of transcription. The region between 66 and 76 base pairs before the cap site contains a variant of the canonical sequence G-G-C-T-C-A-A-T-C-T found preceding many other genes at a similar location, and this region may modulate the efficiency of transcription. The sequence of 425 nucleotides preceding the rabbit beta-globin gene is reported...|$|E
40|$|The DNA {{sequences}} {{of the entire}} structural H 4, H 3, H 2 A and H 2 B genes and of their 5 ' flanking regions have been determined in the histone DNA clone h 19 of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris. In clone h 19 the polarity of transcription and the relative arrangement of the histone genes is identical to that in clone h 22 of the same species. The histone proteins encoded by h 19 DNA differ in their primary structure from those encoded by clone h 22 and have been compared to histone protein {{sequences of}} other sea urchin species {{as well as other}} eukaryotes. A comparative analysis of the 5 ' flanking DNA sequences of the structural histone genes in both clones revealed four ubiquitous sequence motifs; a pentameric element GATCC, followed at short distance by the <b>Hogness</b> <b>box</b> GTATAAATAG, a conserved sequence PyCATTCPu, in or near which the 5 ' ends of the mRNAs map in h 22 DNA and lastly a sequence A, containing the initiation codon. These sequences are also found, sometimes in modified version, in front of other eukaryotic genes transcribed by polymerase II. When prelude sequences of isocoding histone genes in clone h 19 and h 22 are compared areas of homology are seen to extend beyond the ubiquitous sequence motifs towards the divergent AT-rich spacer and terminate between approximately 140 and 240 nucleotides away from the structural gene. These prelude regions contain quite large conservative sequence blocks which are specific for each type of histone genes...|$|E
