5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess {{were the}} missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, {{and their ability}} to play defense was secondary.|$|E

5|$|Governor Ford's allies {{encouraged}} Carroll {{to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1974, but Carroll {{had already}} set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on the governorship. Instead, Ford ran for and won the Senate seat, and Carroll succeeded him as governor. In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Jefferson County Judge Todd Hollenbach, former state Auditor Mary Louise Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} New York's School of Industrial Art {{where he}} studied painting and music and would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique. But he dropped out at age 16 to help support his family. He worked as a copy boy and runner for the Associated Press in Manhattan and in several other low-skilled, low-paying jobs. However, he mostly set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on a professional singing career, returning to performing as a singing waiter, playing and winning amateur nights all around the city, and having a successful engagement at a Paramus, New Jersey, nightclub.|$|E

Having defeated him at WrestleMania X and replicated Bret's victory in the 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Owen set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on Bret's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The two met at SummerSlam 1994 in a Steel Cage match for the title. Jim Neidhart was in the audience to support Owen. Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers, got involved with the feud by siding with Bret after Neidhart attacked Smith after the cage match.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{retired to}} a monastery, {{where he died}} in 969, while Boris was {{released}} from Byzantine custody and recognized as Tsar Boris II. For the moment, it appeared that Nikephoros' plan had worked. However, Sviatoslav's brief sojourn into the south awakened in him the desire to conquer these fertile and rich lands. In this intention he was apparently encouraged by the former Byzantine envoy, Kalokyros, who coveted the imperial crown for himself. Thus, after defeating the Pechenegs, he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> southward again.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, {{who would go}} on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, {{he spent much of}} 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> on {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, {{the capital of}} the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a failed}} bid {{to win the}} 2001 Alberta championship, the team then boycotted the Brier, as {{prominent}} curling teams of the day wanted {{to focus more on}} the World Curling Tour, while the Canadian Curling Association scheduled events conflicting with major WCT events. In the meantime, however, Martin still had <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> set on an Olympic championship. The team went to the 2001 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials and finished first after the round robin with a 7–2 win-loss record. That gave the team a bye to the finals, which Martin won by defeating Kerry Burtnyk with a score of 8–7.|$|E
