40|$|The {{detection}} of a brief <b>increment</b> in {{the intensity of}} a longer duration pedestal is commonly used {{as a measure of}} intensity-resolution. <b>Increment</b> detection is known to improve with increasing duration of the <b>increment</b> and also with increasing duration of the pedestal, but the relative effects of these two parameters have not been explored in the same study. In several past studies of the effects of <b>increment</b> duration, pedestal duration was increased as <b>increment</b> duration increased. In the present study, <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration were independently manipulated. Increment-detection thresholds were determined for four subjects with normal-hearing using a 500 - or 4000 -Hz pedestal presented at 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). <b>Increment</b> durations were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms.

Multiple-regression analyses indicate that <b>increment</b> detection under these conditions is determined primarily by pedestal duration. Follow-up experiments ruled out effects of off-frequency listening or overshoot. The results suggest that effects of <b>increment</b> duration have been confounded by effects of pedestal duration in studies that co-varied <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration.
