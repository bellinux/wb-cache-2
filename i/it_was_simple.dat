5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

500|$|The five-needle {{telegraph}} with twenty possible needle positions was six codes {{short of}} being able to encode the complete alphabet. [...] The letters omitted were C, J, Q, U, X and Z.

Simmonds and Roby Wentz contend that while this may have been a tertiary goal of the alphabet, a sort of [...] "happy accident", the main purpose of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> orthographic reform. Simmonds notes that the teaching of English to foreigners was not a mere hypothetical to mask isolationist tendencies: 35% of the Utah Territory's population at the time was Scandinavian, with German, Italian and Welsh speaking people also making up a considerable percentage of inhabitants; therefore, communication between the recently baptized and the community was a real problem.|$|E
500|$|Garnet first {{appeared}} {{in front of the}} Privy Council on 13 February 1606. Present were John Popham, Edward Coke, Sir William Waad, and the Earls of Worcester, Northampton, Nottingham and Salisbury. [...] Superficially, they treated him with respect, removing their hats and addressing him as [...] "Mr Garnet", although they made fun of his relationship with Anne Vaux, claiming he was her lover, not her confessor. During his questioning he admitted some of his movements, and that he had received Catesby's letter on 6 November, but he denied being involved in the plot, whose members he did not name. [...] Garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in the failed scheme and believed {{he might be able to}} clear his name, but the councillors also asked him about the doctrine of equivocation. [...] His own treatise on this topic, one of the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] found amongst Francis Tresham's possessions, was laid on the council table before him. [...] Although it condemned lying, Garnet's treatise supported the notion that when questioned, for instance, on the presence of a priest in his house, a Catholic might [...] "securely in conscience" [...] answer [...] "No" [...] if he had a [...] "secret meaning reserved in his mind". [...] The occasions on which a Catholic might legitimately use equivocation, he supposed, were limited, but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness—especially to the king's council, who may not have wanted to see Garnet prove his case. [...] The council's view of equivocation was very different from Garnet's. [...] In their eyes, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> deceit.|$|E

2500|$|Faxon D. Atherton, {{a native}} of Massachusetts, had spent several years in Chile and Hawaii as a trader in tallow, hides and merchandise. His friend and {{business}} associate, Thomas Lark, had written to him [...] "there is education available for your children and a dignity of living on landed estates down the San Francisco peninsula (that is) convenient and accessible." [...] Atherton purchased [...] for ten dollars an acre ($2470/km²) in 1860. His home, [...] "Valparaíso Park", was built several years later. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> in design and ample for his family of seven children.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sergeant}} eventually repudiated his confessions, {{claiming they}} had been coerced. [...] The agents who obtained them admitted to harsh interrogation techniques, so the confessions were excluded at the sergeant's trial in October 1924. [...] With the prosecution case largely consisting of the argument {{that it was impossible}} for Alexander Cronkhite to have shot himself by accident, given the angle of the shot and the distance of the gun from his body when it was fired, their central claim collapsed when a friend of Alexander Cronkhite’s, Eugene M. Caffey, and a second officer each demonstrated in court that an accidental shooting that fit the circumstances was not only possible, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> to recreate a plausible series of events which could have resulted in Alexander Cronkhite pulling the trigger by mistake. [...] The sergeant was quickly acquitted; charges against the captain were soon dropped.|$|E
2500|$|González's parents, Manuel Antonio González and Carmen Alire Alonso, {{migrated}} from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. {{in the early}} 1900s. González was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that [...] "Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot like mine. He had a great mother {{and there was always}} a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, he might have been spoiled as a kid. It's a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage". However, according to other sources, Gonzales's father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, González states, [...] "We had few luxuries at our house. Food wasn't abundant but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes – inexpensive but clean." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Liverpool was led by Chadwick, who was assisted by Frisch, Rotblat, Gerry Pickavance, Maurice Pryce and John Riley Holt. The division at Liverpool also controlled a small team at the nearby University of Bristol that included Alan Nunn May and Cecil Frank Powell. At Liverpool they focused on the separation of isotopes through thermal diffusion as was suggested in the Frisch-Peierls memorandum. The {{was based on the}} fact that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. That this can be used as a means of isotope separation was first demonstrated by Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938, who used it to separate isotopes of neon. They used an apparatus called a [...] "column", consisting of a vertical tube with a hot wire down the centre. The advantage of the technique was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>simple</b> in design and there were no moving parts. But it could take months to reach equilibrium, required a lot of energy, and needed high temperatures that could cause a problem with the uranium hexafluoride.|$|E
