60|$|The little steamer reached Durban safely {{at midnight}} on November 4, and we passed an {{impatient}} six {{hours in a}} sleeping town waiting for daylight and news. Both came in their turn.

The hours I passed in Durban were not without occupation. The hospital ship 'Sumatra' lay close to our moorings, and {{as soon as it was}} light I visited her to look for friends, and found, alas! several in a sorry plight. All seemed to be as well as the tenderest care and the most lavish expenditure of money could make them. All told much the same tale--the pluck and spirit of the troops, the stubborn unpretentious valour of the Boer, the searching musketry. Everyone predicted a prolonged struggle.|$|E
