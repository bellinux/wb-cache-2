It should be noted that a 37 S <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> has a relatively small flow area and high flow resistance at the peripheral subchannels of its center element compared to the other subchannels. The configuration of a <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> is one of the important factors affecting the local CHF occurrence. Considering the CHF characteristics of a 37 S <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> in terms of CHF enhancement, there can be two approaches to enlarge the flow areas of the peripheral subchannels of a center element in order to enhance CHF of a 37 S <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle.</b> To increase the center subchannel areas, one approach is the reduction of the diameter of a center element, and the other is an increase of the inner pitch circle. The former can increase the total flow area of a <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> and redistributes the power density of all fuel elements as well as the CHF. On the other hand, the latter can reduce the gap between the elements located in the middle and inner pitch circles owing to the increasing inner pitch circle. This can also affect the enthalpy redistribution of the <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> and finally enhance CHF or dry-out power. In this study, the above two approaches, which are proposed to enlarge the flow areas of the center subchannels, were considered to investigate the impact of the flow area changes of the center subchannels on the CHF enhancement as well as the thermal characteristics by applying a subchannel analysis method...|$|R

Most of the aging effects for the CANDU primary heat transport system were originated from the horizontal crept pressure tubes. As the operating years of a CANDU reactor proceed, a pressure tube experiences high neutron irradiation damage under high temperature and pressure. The crept pressure tube can deteriorate the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) of a fuel channel and finally worsen the reactor operating performance and thermal margin.

40|$|As a {{promising}} new fuel for high power density light water reactors, {{the feasibility of}} using annular fuel for BWR services is explored from both thermal hydraulic and neutronic points of view. Keeping the bundle size similar to conventional GE 8 × 8 solid <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles,</b> annular <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles</b> of 5 × 5 and 6 × 6 lattices, that have increased thermal output potential, are explored. The large annular fuel rods allow both external and internal cooling, which increases the fuel {{surface to volume ratio}} and significantly reduces the fuel temperature. A methodology is developed and VIPRE code calculations are performed to select the best annular <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> design {{on the basis of its}} Critical Power Ratio (CPR) performance. Within the limits applied to the reference solid fuel, the CPR margin in the 5 x 5 and 6 x 6 annular <b>fuel</b> <b>bundles</b> is traded for an increase in power density. It is found that the power density increase with annular fuel in BWRs may be limited to 23 %. This is smaller than possible for PWRs due to the difference in the mechanisms that control the critical thermal conditions of the two reactors. The neutronic aspects of annular fuel in BWRs, including the reactivity history, power distribution, and burnup characteristics, are investigated. Results are compared to the conventional BWR solid <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle</b> for the same power density and total energy. In general switching to annular fuel implies smaller neutronic differences than in the PWR case. The local peaking factors are found to be similar or slightly better than those of the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>bundle.</b> To maintain the same fuel cycle length, the burnup needs to be increased even for the same bundle energy output, due to reduced fuel loading. These results are based on two dimensional bundle models using the CASMO code, whose validity has been checked using MCNP models. In summary, the annular fuel could be a profitable alternative to the solid fuel due to neutronic and thermal advantages.
