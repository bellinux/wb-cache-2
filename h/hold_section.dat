5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not <b>hold</b> <b>Section</b> 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E

Also, the Government believed the Court should <b>hold</b> <b>Section</b> 118C valid under the Basic Law because Section 118D, similar to Section 118C, equally applied onto and prohibited heterosexuals from engaging buggery under 21:(Court of Appeal judgement, paragraph 46) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to arguing that Stanley {{gave him the}} right to import such material, Luros also challenged the procedures of the case under the Fifth Amendment, {{pointing out that the}} statute, Section 1305 of Title 18 of the United States Code, did not give a time frame within which the government had to begin forfeiture proceedings against the seized material and did not even require the government move in a timely fashion. A panel of two judges from the Central District of California and one judge from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with him on the Stanley claim but found the lack of a time limit alone enough to <b>hold</b> <b>Section</b> 1305 unconstitutional.|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari to {{hear the}} case on the limited {{question}} of [...] "whether Congress' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution." [...] The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on February 27, 2013. Media coverage of the Justices' comments during oral arguments portrayed the Court as appearing likely to <b>hold</b> <b>Section</b> 5 or Section 4(b) unconstitutional. Justice Antonin Scalia drew criticism from civil rights leaders, after expressing his belief during oral arguments that Congress reauthorized Section 5, not because the legislation was necessary, but because it constituted a [...] "racial entitlement" [...] that Congress was unlikely to end.|$|E
