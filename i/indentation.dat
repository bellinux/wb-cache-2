5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large <b>indentation</b> {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the <b>indentation</b> supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|Spores are {{elliptical}} or oblong in shape, smooth, inamyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of 3.5–4.5 by 1.5–2.5 µm.

5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular <b>indentation</b> {{at one end of}} the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E
5|$|The spores are elongated, smooth, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 4–6 by 1.5–2 µm. Scanning electron microscopy {{has revealed that}} C.ruber (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar—a small <b>indentation</b> in {{the surface of the}} spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are six-spored.|$|E
5|$|There is no anterocone on M2, {{but a large}} anteroloph {{is present}} {{in front of the}} paracone. There is a protoflexus—an <b>indentation</b> in the crown in front of the protocone.

In this work, we report experimental results on damping flexural vibrations in rectangular plates containing tapered <b>indentations</b> (pits) of power-law profile, the centres of which are covered by a small amount of absorbing material. In the case of quadratic or higher-order profiles, such <b>indentations</b> materialise two-dimensional acoustic 'black holes' for flexural waves. Initially, the effects of single pits have been investigated. It has been found that, in order to increase the damping efficiency of power-law profiled <b>indentations,</b> their absorption crossections should be enlarged by drilling a central hole of sufficiently large size (14 mm), while keeping the edges sharp. Such pits, being in fact curved power-law wedges, result in substantially increased damping. The next and the major part of this investigation involved using multiple <b>indentations</b> in the same rectangular plates to increase damping. Plates with combinations from two to six equal <b>indentations</b> have been investigated. The results show that, when multiple <b>indentations</b> are used, the associated damping increases substantially with the increase of a number of <b>indentations.</b> For the plate with 6 <b>indentations,</b> the resulting damping becomes comparable if not greater than that achieved by a wedge of power-law profile...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for identifying <b>indentations</b> on {{the boundary of}} solid 2 D shape.

An efficient implementation is described based on the Fourier transform for calculating curvature from a sequence of points obtained from the boundary of a binary blob...|$|R
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of S.spraguei appear olive-brown in color, {{although}} this changes to clay or tawny-olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9–11 by 3–4.5µm; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface <b>indentation</b> formed where the spore attaches to the basidia), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not amyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are thin-walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17–19 by 5–7.8µm. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, they appear hyaline (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace <b>indentation</b> to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the pelvic fin origins. The second dorsal fin is located midway between the first dorsal and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep <b>indentation</b> where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E

By comparing the three cases, one observes that the <b>indentations</b> have a shielding effect. 1...|$|R
50|$|An {{electrostatic}} detection device, or EDD, is a specialized {{piece of equipment}} commonly used in questioned document examination to reveal <b>indentations</b> or impressions in paper that may otherwise go unnoticed. It is a non-destructive technique (will not damage the evidence in question), allowing further tests to be carried out. It is a sensitive technique capable of detecting <b>indentations</b> on pages several layers below the top sheet and many years after the <b>indentations</b> were created.|$|R

5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an <b>indentation.</b> In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the <b>indentation</b> separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However {{it does have a}} size effect in bending and <b>indentation,</b> associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{northeast}} monsoon, {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March. It carries winds {{that have already}} lost their moisture out to the ocean (opposite from the summer monsoon). They cross India diagonally from northeast to southwest. However, the large <b>indentation</b> made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin and rest of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.|$|E
2500|$|Documents {{that have}} been {{subjected}} to high levels of humidity will not generally retain <b>indentations.</b> [...] As a result, other forensic examinations involving the wetting of a document, such as fingerprint development using a ninhydrin solution, should not be done until after examination for <b>indentations.</b>|$|R

5|$|On M1, the anterocone (the cusp at {{the front}} of the tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. The {{connection}} between the protocone and the paracone, the major cusps immediately after the anterocone, is located relatively far toward the front. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph accessory crest is present. On M2, there is no protoflexus (an <b>indentation</b> in front of the protocone, which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph, the mesoflexus, is not divided into two pieces by a paracone–mesoloph connection. These traits are both characteristic of the Nectomys subclade. The mesoloph is present on M3, but the posteroloph, a crest at the back of the tooth, is absent or vestigial, as is the hypoflexus (the valley between the protocone and the cusp behind it, the hypocone). The absence or near-absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates Pennatomys from related oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central <b>indentation</b> (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no {{corresponding}} crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. There is always a large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an <b>indentation</b> on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Applied Acoustics [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] the present paper, experimental results are reported on damping flexural vibrations in rectangular plates containing tapered <b>indentations</b> (pits) of power-law profile, with the centres of the <b>indentations</b> covered by a small amount of absorbing material. In the case of quadratic or higher-order profiles, such <b>indentations</b> materialise two-dimensional acoustic ‘black holes’ for flexural waves that can absorb almost 100 % of the incident elastic energy. In the present investigation, pits have been made in different locations of rectangular plates, and the corresponding frequency response functions have been measured. It has been found that basic power-law <b>indentations,</b> with no or very small central hole, result in rather low reduction in resonant peak amplitudes, which {{may be due to the}} relatively small effective absorption area in this case. To increase the damping efficiency of power-law profiled <b>indentations,</b> this absorption area has been enlarged by increasing the size of the central hole in the pit, while keeping the edges sharp. As expected, such pits, being in fact curved power-law wedges, result in substantially increased damping. When multiple <b>indentations</b> are used, the resultant damping increases substantially, as expected, and may become comparable if not greater than that achieved by one-dimensional wedges of power-law profile...|$|R
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a plasticine marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an <b>indentation</b> in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are few instances of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line <b>indentation</b> and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small <b>indentation</b> in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E

Depending on the individual, the <b>indentations</b> may be very shallow, or very deep, forming very long [...] "fingers," [...] or digits. While rotulids are very distinctive in appearance, they are also highly morphic, with a tremendous diversity seen in individual specimens. That the digits are very fragile, and prone to breaking off and regenerating only adds to individual variations.|$|R
