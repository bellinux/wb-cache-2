In particular, Dolphin proposed a design of the lifting carriage of a masted <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> which applies a downward thrust to counteract the bending moment produced on the mast by the load on the load support The team also patented a solution to prevent fork lift trucks having to keep repositioning to lift loads by designing a horizontally movable slide.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Myriad was shown at a {{computer}} show in South Africa but unfortunately the machine was {{dropped out of the}} transporting aircraft resulting in the chassis being considerably distorted.

Also owned are various <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks,</b> and garage floor cleaning equipment known as 'Floor Scrubbers'.|$|R
50|$|The Lauterbrunnen-Mürren line also handles {{goods traffic}} {{to and from}} Mürren. This is done by {{carrying}} the goods in pallets that are carried under the cable car and on flat cars towed by the railcars. The pallets are transferred between the two by a complicated machine, part <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck</b> and part funicular, within the Grütschalp station complex. The complex also houses the workshops of the line.|$|E

50|$|Despite great {{efforts to}} {{establish}} a nationwide network of outlets, Calor Autogas (vehicle propane) never quite reached expectations, due largely to the Government's inability to recognise its considerable environmental advantages by reducing duty. However, the fuel did become very popular for <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks,</b> helped greatly by the launch, in 1989, of Calor's exhaust purification system, EPS2000, which enabled vehicles to be used both indoors and outside.|$|R
50|$|Buchanan was {{historically}} {{known as}} the headquarters for Clark Equipment Company, a manufacturer of <b>truck</b> axles, <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks,</b> front-end loaders, and other heavy machinery. The company was formed in 1916 out of an acquisition of two other Buchanan companies. Clark left {{the area in the}} 1990s, forcing the city to diversify, and a number of smaller businesses took over the buildings Clark essentially donated to the city.|$|R
5000|$|Barloworld Handling Ltd {{argued that}} since they already {{acquired}} {{a company called}} Unilift Ltd, Unilift South Wales Ltd should change their name as Unilift Ltd had goodwill and reputation for the marketing, hiring and servicing of <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks</b> in Swansea and Cardiff. The problems came from the fact of Unilift South Wales Ltd marketing similar products to those marketed by Unilift Ltd and as evidence of confusion, Unilift Ltd had received invoices intended for Unilift South Wales Ltd.|$|R
50|$|On Friday 17 June 2011, Glennie {{was arrested}} after being caught {{two and a}} half times the drink drive limit. Police, who had been tipped off {{anonymously}} that Glennie may drive, pulled him over yards away from the pub in Dundee's Kinghorne Road.

50|$|Merlo {{was founded}} in 1911 in Cuneo. In the {{beginning}} the company managers worked in a small workshop. In 1964 the company took new direction of production and improved {{the state of the}} company into that of big machine manufacturer. In 1966 the company built their first concrete mixers and in 1970 their first off-road <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck.</b> In 1981 Merlo produced their first telescopic handler, the SM 30. The company continues to specialize in handlers.|$|E
50|$|The {{slip sheet}} {{is used as}} a pallet support device in vehicle {{delivery}} and transportation of products. When slip sheets are supported by a pallet board, flat load carrying surface, or a cart or <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>truck,</b> the structural strength of the slip sheet supports the product load's weight. With the slip sheet supported by one of these transportation devices the unit load can easily be transported both internally within a facility and externally between two facility locations.|$|E
5000|$|MATERIALS HANDLING : MPDS4 MECHANICAL HANDLING is {{a design}} {{application}} {{with a series}} of configurable catalogs of mechanical materials handling components, which can be physically interconnected to form part of an industrial process. It includes catalogs of conveyor belts, cranes, <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks,</b> industrial racking and robots and allows installation designers to select, lay out, configure, visualise and add intelligence to process machinery in a plant. The module also supports the controlled creation of product specials for materials handling.|$|R
50|$|Teklogix (more fully, Teklogix International Inc.) {{was created}} in 1967 by Lawrence Cragg {{together}} {{with a small group}} of engineers.The company focused on mini computer applications. It designed and built complete systems based upon DEC's PDP-8 computer, DEC's logic modules and purpose built logic. Many of the company's projects involved control of material handling systems and this led to the development of radio linked terminals for installation on <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks</b> complete with multiplexers to interface to a variety of main frame computer systems.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his interests in refrigeration, Carl von Linde had also partnered with Hugo Güldner and Georg von Krauß and others in 1904 to form the Güldner Motoren-Gesellschaft mbH in Munich, which was moved to Aschaffenburg in 1906. Linde took full ownership of the company in 1929, and from this origin developed a business manufacturing first engines and tractors, and then from the 1950s onwards, a range of mechanical handling equipment such as <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> Linde also acquired the Aktiengesellschaft für Industriegasverwertung (english: Corporation for Industry Gas Utilization [...] ), {{commonly referred to as}} the Heylandt Works.|$|R
