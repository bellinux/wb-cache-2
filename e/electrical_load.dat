2500|$|An {{electrical}} ballast is {{a device}} which limits the current through an <b>electrical</b> <b>load.</b> These {{are most often}} used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases. [...] If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it will be destroyed or caused the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive resistance or reactance that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.|$|E

30|$|According to Figs.  7 and 8, {{during the}} 1 st~ 8 th hour when <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> are low and wind energy is in surplus, P 2 G {{facilities}} are operating {{to accommodate the}} surplus wind energy, which is thus converted into methane and provided to the natural gas network. However, the power consumption of P 2 G facilities does not reach the upper limit (600  MW) which would accommodate more wind energy. This is because P 2 G facilities’ reserve constraint is considered in the electricity dispatch model to cope with load prediction errors and wind energy fluctuations.

(Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} an optimization approach to schedule <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> given a short term prediction of time-varying power {{production and the}} ability to store only a limited amount of electrical energy. The proposed approach is unique and versatile as it allows scheduling of <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> that each have their own dynamic power demand during on/off switching, while also allowing the specification of minimum on/off times for each loads separately. The optimization approach is formulated as a parallel enumeration of all possible on/off times of the <b>electrical</b> <b>loads</b> using a moving time approach in which only a short term power production forecast is needed, {{while at the same time}} taking into account constraints on electrical energy storage and power delivery of a battery system.
