Foxx contributed to his character's appearance, suggesting full-scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style. Foxx described the appearance as [...] "a guy who maybe went to jail <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> now he's living in his own time capsule.

500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy.

The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing".

She said, [...] "It's so freeing to let your dark side shine <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> when you do a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, you laugh. It's just fun." ...|$|E

Only six flights totaling two hours and twenty-five minutes had been completed by 21 January 1948 and the VRDK had only been run <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> half during a ground test.

Kelly said [...] "I love basketball enough to not totally let go of my music, but just put it to the side <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> fulfill some dreams of mine that I've had for a long time."

2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done...

2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun in his hand, in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E
