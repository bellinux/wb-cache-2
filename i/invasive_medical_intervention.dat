5000|$|In contrast, in an {{interview}} study, sex-selection technology providers generally argued that sex selection {{is an expression of}} reproductive rights, was initiated and pursued by women, and was a sign of female empowerment that allowed couples to make well-informed family planning decisions, prevented occurrences of unintended pregnancy and abortion, and minimized intimate partner violence and/or child neglect. [...] The Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that it is ethically appropriate to employ these new reproductive technologies to avoid the birth of children suffering from X-linked genetic disorders. However, to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis and sex selection solely for non-medical reasons, the Committee claims, is morally inappropriate. Also, primary care physicians questioned whether women could truly express free choice under pressure from family and community. In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence.

The present observational study aimed to identify these barriers. During the six months study period, patients hospitalized in a Belgian geriatric hospital and benefiting from palliative care were prospectively {{compared to those who}} died without palliative care. Nearly half of our patients died without access to palliative care. Compared to the patients who had received palliative care, these patients showed less often pain and more often dyspnea. <b>Invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> and use of antibiotics were more frequent in patients who died without access to palliative care. Benzodiazepines were used less frequently compared to palliative care patients. In patients who died without access to palliative care, communication with the patient was inferior as compared to palliative care patients. The former group showed more often cognitive impairment, social isolation, and a more rapid, unanticipated death. We identified the following risk factors for not benefiting from palliative care in geriatrics: absence of identified pain syndrome; presence of dyspnea; absence of oncologic diagnosis; social isolation and poor communication with the patient and her/his family; cognitive dysfunction and unexpected death.

40|$|The {{fears and}} beliefs {{patients}} hold about <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> may affect their perceptions about risk and subsequent decisions to undergo those procedures. Little {{is known about}} fears and beliefs in patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures {{and their relationship to}} perceptions of risks. Using a grounded theory approach, 10 men and 10 women referred for their first cardiac catheterization (CATH) from referral centers in Ontario, Canada were interviewed to identify fears and beliefs related to the procedure. Overall, women expressed more fears than men. Fears for both groups arose from: (1) lack of control about (i) physical aspects and (ii) psychosocial aspects of the CATH; (2) an unknown future; and (3) possible medical complications. Beliefs related to health personnel involved in the CATH, the technology used during the CATH and personal coping mechanisms. Men were more inclined to believe in technology, which overrode concerns about the procedure. Participants viewed CATH as a routine and necessary step in determining their future. Patients imputed previously held fears and beliefs and formulated new ones regarding the CATH during the process of anticipating the procedure. They viewed themselves as passive participants and not as actively consenting to the CATH. This paper offers previously undocumented insights from patients regarding CATH and provides the basis for developing future investigations.

40|$|Physical {{symptoms}} {{without any}} identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities on detailed clinical examination and investigations, {{are common in}} children. Some children may have persistent physical discomfort {{which can lead to}} debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Aims Encounter in General Practice/Family Medicine is {{a meeting}} point between illness and disease. Looking at {{patients}} and doctors beliefs and attitudes, one can define four fields of activity describing the major working areas in GP/FM. Considering clinical prevention as {{the management of}} processes over a length of time {{through the lens of}} the patient doctor relationships, one can define four main prevention domains. Methods Using a double entry table, we show how the definitions already published in the Wonca Glossary of general practice fit perfectly to the fields I, II and III of prevention and how the fourth definition was developed and edited. Results The story of the construction of the Quaternary prevention is presented as well as its spread worldwide, through new media, as a core value for many young general practitioners. “Action taken to identify a patient or a population at risk of overmedicalisation, to protect them from <b>invasive</b> <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> and provide for them care procedures which are scientifically and medically acceptable ” Born in 1986, presented {{for the first time in}} Wonca Hong Kong 1995, developed in Durham USA in 1999 the concept has been edited in 2003 in the Wonca dictionary of general practice. Quaternary prevention has now reached the international community of GPs and is considered as a core value by many Wonca representatives Discussion This approach enables us to clarify the concepts of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary prevention while defining a new one: Quaternary prevention. The latter encompasses the consequences of the encounter between the anxiety of the patient and the uncertainty of the doctor and gives insight into the propensity of this kind of meeting to distil sickness, thus creating false positive with its cohort of avoidable human, social and economic costs and suffering. Quaternary prevention (P 4), an answer of family doctors facing overmedicalization aims to protect the patient or population against the danger of medicine. See www. ph 3 c. org/P 4.

Jamoulle& M. Roland, describes the protection of patients from diagnostic tests, interventions and treatments that offer no benefit for overall morbidity or mortality for the individual, and may cause physical or psychological harm. The P 4 concept pulls together all reflexive moves on the problems resulting from an excess of medical care, such as overscreening, overinvestigation, overprescription, and overtreatment. Since the first workshop in Wonca Basel 2009, the P 4 concept has spread throughout the world, and has provoked an intense exchange of ideas. The speakers gathered here from around the world intend to show how front line family physicians could analyze, understand, appropriate and use the P 4 concept to examine, analyze and modify their practice. The audience will be stimulated to share their concern about {{the limits of}} medicine exchange critical comments on the concept of P 4. At the end of the workshop attendees will be able to able to use and apply Quaternary prevention to improve both the health of individual patients and public policy.

The vascular surgeon should be instrumental in assuring that the peripheral vascular patient receives medical therapy of the same standard as the patient with coronary disease. The major modifiable risk factors in the vascular patient are: smoking, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes. In addition, the use of beta blockers for patients with coronary disease and antiplatelet therapy as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients with peripheral vascular disease.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Tn polyagglutination {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} disorder that has been reported on only a few occasions in the literature, and, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, never before in the context of febrile neutropenia. Case presentation We report the case of a 26 -year-old Caucasian woman who presented to our emergency department complaining of a persistent fever over the previous three days. She had a history of long-standing refractory pancytopenia with multi-lineage dysplasia and severe neutropenia, but she had rarely experienced infection. The results of a physical examination and multiple laboratory tests were unremarkable. While investigating the possible causes of the refractory, long-standing pancytopenia, the possibility of a polyagglutinable state was suggested. Blood samples were sent to the laboratory for an analysis of mixed-field seed lectin agglutination assay. A serum lectin panel confirmed the final diagnosis of Tn-activation. Conclusions We should include Tn-activation in our differential whenever we encounter cases of refractory long-standing idiopathic cytopenias and inconclusive bone marrow results displaying multi-lineage dysplasia. Novel genetic techniques have recently revealed the interesting pathophysiology of this phenomenon. The recognition and inclusion of Tn polyagglutination syndrome in our differential diagnoses has important clinical implications, given its main associated features, such as severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which are usually linked to a benign clinical course and prognosis. Increased awareness of the polyagglutinable disorders will potentially decrease the need for <b>invasive</b> and costly <b>medical</b> <b>interventions</b> and also raises the need for monitoring of this specific sub-set of patients. In addition, the study of the expression and implications of Tn, and other similar antigens, offers a fascinating perspective for the study of its role in the diagnosis, prognosis and immunotherapy of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The infrequency with which Tn polyagglutination {{syndrome is}} encountered, its clinical features and its pathophysiology make it a formidable diagnostic challenge. </p...|$|R
