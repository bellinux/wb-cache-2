5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
25|$|Reporters {{were banned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and relied upon {{second-hand}} reports from Laude family lawyers for their news articles.|$|E
50|$|Another witness, Walter Petty, also {{testified that}} the first shots were fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom's</b> {{northeast}} corner, where Claud Allen was standing. Petty also witnessed a pistol duel between Sidna Allen and Deputy Clerk Dexter Goad.|$|R

50|$|At Claude Allen's {{trial for}} the murder of Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, Judge David W. Bolen was again the prosecution's star witness. Judge Bolen {{confirmed}} his prior testimony that he saw Claud Allen fire the first shot at Judge Massie <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom's</b> northeast corner, whereupon Claud advanced toward the court officers to where Commonwealth's Attorney Foster was standing.|$|R
25|$|Chikatilo {{was taken}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> to his cell at Novocherkassk prison to await execution. He lodged an appeal against his {{conviction}} with the Russian Supreme Court, but this appeal was rejected {{in the summer}} of 1993.|$|E
25|$|Authorities {{anticipated}} {{a possible}} bomb attack {{and had the}} Dedham courtroom outfitted with heavy, sliding steel doors and cast-iron shutters that were painted to appear wooden. Each day during the trial, the courthouse was placed under heavy police security, and Sacco and Vanzetti were escorted to and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> by armed guards.|$|E
25|$|Following Simpson's {{acquittal}} {{of criminal}} charges, Ron Goldman's family filed {{a civil lawsuit}} against Simpson. Daniel Petrocelli represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson. Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided, and he barred television and still cameras, radio equipment, and courtroom sketch artists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> On October 23, 1996, opening statements were made, and on January 16, 1997, both sides rested their cases.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} two-year trial, dozens of {{witnesses}} were heard and many documents were considered. When the Court {{refused to allow}} new evidence from witnesses, Dolci and Alasia decided that the trial was a travesty. They announced that under these circumstances they would no longer attempt to defend themselves. The remainder of the trial, therefore, took place with Dolci and Alasia absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Dolci responded by broadcasting his opinions over a private radio station, which was promptly closed.|$|E
25|$|This book {{details the}} trial of Dmitri Karamazov {{for the murder of}} his father Fyodor. The {{courtroom}} drama is sharply satirized by Dostoyevsky. The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the women are irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri's love triangle with Katerina and Grushenka. Ivan's madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> after recounting his final meeting with Smerdyakov and the aforementioned confession. The turning point in the trial is Katerina's damning testimony against Dmitri. Impassioned by Ivan's illness which she believes is a result of her assumed love for Dmitri, she produces a letter drunkenly written by Dmitri saying that he would kill Fyodor. The section concludes with the impassioned closing remarks of the prosecutor and the defense, and the verdict that Dmitri is guilty.|$|E
25|$|Henry VI was a weak king, and {{has been}} seen {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects created by the decline into bastard feudalism, who {{took advantage of the}} feudal levy being replaced by taxation to develop private armies of liveried retainers. The result was rivalries that often spilled over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> into armed confrontations such as Percy–Neville feud. The common interest given by the war in France had ended, so Richard, Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown while the gentry attached themselves to different factions depending on their private feuds. Henry became the focus of discontent, as population, agricultural production, prices, wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. Most seriously, in 1450 Jack Cade raised a rebellion in an attempt to force the king to address economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed, but the situation remained unsettled, with more radical demands coming from John and William Merfold.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of war Knight proposed to the War Artists' Advisory Committee the Nuremberg war crimes trials as a subject. The Committee agreed, and Knight went to Germany in January 1946 and spent three months observing <b>the</b> main trial <b>from</b> inside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> <b>The</b> result was the large oil painting, The Nuremberg Trial. This painting departs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> realism of her wartime paintings, in that, whilst realistically depicting the Nazi war criminals sitting in the dock, the rear and side walls of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> are missing, to reveal a ruined city, partially in flames.|$|R
50|$|KNBC-TV hired Vandor to {{help create}} and launch The Local Story, L.A.’s first daily, live {{newscast}} produced exclusively for the Internet. October 20, 2006, she scored another first in electronic journalism by reporting <b>the</b> verdict live <b>from</b> inside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in <b>the</b> Santa Monica Farmer’s Market trial where no cameras were allowed. Cindy’s ground-breaking reporting was aired live on MSNBC, CNBC, and on websites around the world.|$|R
50|$|Victor Allen, whose pistol {{was used}} in the {{courthouse}} shooting, said he saw Wesley Edwards <b>from</b> outside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> firing a revolver through the courthouse window and over spectators' heads just after the shooting began, and later saw Edwards run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> courthouse together with Sidna Allen. Victor Allen also asserted that Claud's shooting must have done with his gun, since Claud had taken Victor's handgun as the two left their hotel in Hillsville on that morning..|$|R
25|$|On July 29, the {{day after}} the shooting, Haq {{appeared}} in court for his bail hearing. King County, Washington District Court Judge Barbara Linde found that the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office had probable cause to charge Haq with one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder. Before the proceedings began, Haq requested that the judge allow him to not attend the hearing. Linde denied both this request and another motion to bar cameras and video taping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> She also set Haq's bail at $50 million. On August 2, Haq was formally charged with nine felonies: aggravated murder, five counts of attempted murder, kidnapping, burglary and malicious harassment. Malicious harassment is a hate crime under Washington State law. Aggravated murder, the most serious of the nine charges, carries only two possible sentences in Washington: life in prison or the death penalty. The prosecution, however, ultimately decided not to seek the death penalty because of Haq's history of mental illness.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, {{a heavily}} armed, 17-year-old African-American high-school student, gained {{control over a}} {{courtroom}} in Marin County, California. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages. As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge and the three black men {{were killed in the}} melee; one of the jurors and the prosecutor were injured. Although the judge {{was shot in the head}} with a blast from the shotgun, he also suffered a chest wound from a bullet that may have been fired from outside the van. Evidence during the trial showed, however, that either could have been fatal. The firearms which Jackson used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Judge Haley, had been purchased by Davis two days prior, and the barrel of the shotgun had been sawn off. Davis was found to have been corresponding with one of the inmates involved.|$|E
25|$|When Marge escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{and goes}} to the library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a {{newspaper}} tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E

40|$|Standard of Care {{applies to}} all conduct of all persons in all realms of activity. It is {{concerned}} with the acceptable activity of a practitioner in providing care for a patient. Failure to adhere to a minimum standard renders the practitioner liable for malpractice and negligence. Standards are affected by two factors, those within the profession via scientific research and development, and those external to it, namely government, administrative organizations, the courts and the doctor-patient “contract”. Each of these factors directly impact upon the delivery and/or alterations in the Standards of Care. It is imperative that the doctor realize that a failure to adhere to the Standard may result in action being taken by the above groups. Further, doctors must be aware that Standards are a volatile concept, changing as rapidly as the daily judgements eminating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms,</b> as new discoveries are introduced and as recognized by specialized groups. Maintaining current Standards ensure excellence in both professional practices and patient care...|$|R
50|$|East of the Mountains is a {{novel by}} American author David Guterson, first {{published}} in 1999, and in paperback in 2000. His second full novel, it marks something of {{a change of pace}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> taut <b>courtroom</b> drama of Snow Falling on Cedars (1994), being primarily focused on the chance actions and introspective musings of its protagonist {{over the course of a}} few days.|$|R
500|$|Inside {{the ornate}} building's third floor {{courtroom}} is a stained glass skylight centered by a ten-pointed star. The room is adorned with six brass lamps, and chandeliers, which are clustered with glass globes. In its original state an old-fashioned, four-bladed ceiling fan hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> ceiling. The third floor courtroom has been called, [...] "the building's single most distinctive interior space" [...] by Steve Bigolin. The furnishings in the courtroom, including the chandeliers, plasterwork, beveled glass doors and stained glass work are all original.|$|E
500|$|During the trial, the {{defendants}} were escorted to a [...] "holding pen" [...] {{outside the courtroom}} several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi. While in the holding pen, they listened to the proceedings over loudspeakers. Both defendants were repeatedly cited for contempt of court and eventually barred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> where the trial continued in their absence. A contemporary New York Times editorial criticized Williams for failing to maintain courtroom [...] "decorum," [...] comparing her actions to William Kunstler's recent contempt conviction for his actions during the [...] "Chicago Seven" [...] trial.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Device {{was charged}} with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, {{together}} with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared {{in the shape of a}} brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.|$|E

5000|$|The eighth (final) {{session was}} {{attended}} by representatives of ACPRA, the Human Rights First Society, the National Society for Human Rights, and international journalists. Mabahith plainclothes agents {{were present in the}} corridors near <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> itself and tried to prevent human rights organisation representatives and journalists <b>from</b> entering <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> ACPRA described <b>the</b> official absence as [...] "contempt of the judiciary". The presiding judge stated that the Ministry of Interior had informed the Grievances Board the previous night, 27 August 2010, that al-Reshoudi and the other detainees had been tried in court in Jeddah. Al-Reshoudi's defence team stated that the Jeddah trial consisted of the detainees appearing with hands and legs chained before an unidentified [...] "judge-like individual" [...] from an unidentified institution, and did not constitute an appearance before a competent court. The judge dismissed the case against Mabahith [...] "for lack of jurisdiction".|$|R
500|$|Four of {{the accused}} men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton, and Norris {{publicly}} maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London, before a jury of 27 peers. She was accused of adultery, incest, and high treason. By the Treason Act of Edward III, adultery {{on the part of}} a queen was a form of treason (because of the implications for the succession to the throne) for which the penalty was hanging, drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman, but the accusations, and especially that of incestuous adultery, were also designed to impugn her moral character. The other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting the king's death, with her [...] "lovers", so that she might later marry Henry Norris. Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, sat on the jury that unanimously found Anne guilty. When the verdict was announced, he collapsed and had to be carried <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> He died childless eight months later and was succeeded by his nephew. According to a 1980 legal review by Schauer and Schauer, [...] "there is little if any evidence, apart from Smeaton's possible torture, that the rules of the time were in any way bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn's conviction".|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2002 RAND study, post Daubert, the {{percentage}} of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> significantly rose.

5000|$|A legal defence {{team for}} Suliman al-Reshoudi filed {{a court case}} in the Grievances Board against the Ministry of Interior/Mabahith on 16 August 2009 {{on the grounds that}} 2 February 2007 detentions were arbitrary. Eight court {{sessions}} were held, and the case was dismissed in the eighth session [...] "for lack of jurisdiction". The eighth (final) session was attended by representatives of ACPRA, the Human Rights First Society, the National Society for Human Rights, and international journalists.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between public opinion and rumour from ancient times, through the Middle Ages and right up to today. It will examine the terms which were used and which often depended not just on a particular author but usually an entire social class. The most often used terms to describe opinion, fama and existimatio, occurred in the speeches of politicians which were presented as the valuable opinions of the elite whereas the concepts opinio, rumor or sermo were considered as low value and unreliable opinions of plebeians to whom the ruling classes attributed the spreading and creation of rumours. The concept of fama, more often fama publica, indicated in the Middle Ages a local network of knowledge, a mechanism for the collective evaluation of an individual. In this sense it {{played an important role}} in the courts of law. The issue of rumours is common to all subsequent historical periods because public opinion usually both generated, and was supported, by rumour. The article also puts forward a hypothesis why the all-powerful fama dissapeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms,</b> why it lost its significance and became purely a rumour.
