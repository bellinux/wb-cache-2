5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and {{to study how}} a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} with an {{introductory}} sequence depicting {{the assassination of the}} President of the United States, William Sheridan. The protagonist, Jason Fly (voiced by David Duchovny), awakes on Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York City. Badly wounded, he is rescued by a lifeguard and is brought into a beach house. He has lost all his memories and all that he possesses is a locker box key. He also has a tattoo with the Roman numeral XIII on his right shoulder. He is then attacked by unknown assailants, led by a hitman known as The Mongoose, with whom Fly does battle several times throughout the game. However, he is later instead arrested by the FBI as a chief suspect in the murder. A photo proves that he resembles the murderer. XIII succeeds in escaping the headquarters {{with the aid of a}} female soldier, Jones. One of Fly's few other allies is Ben Carrington: an old war veteran and superior to Jones, Carrington knows valuable information about the President's death and is willing to help XIII. However, he is arrested and brought to a military station in the Appalachian mountains to be silenced by the conspiracy. XIII must infiltrate the base and free Carrington if he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about his past.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} goal of vocal development <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to sing {{to the natural}} limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal {{when all of the}} physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.|$|E

25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also {{seems to be the case}} that the more languages one knows, the easier it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Western art, drawing the human figure from living models was {{considered}} {{the most effective way}} to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best to draw from life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs. Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject. Models for life drawing classes are usually nude. In the classroom setting, where the purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how to draw the human form in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.|$|E
25|$|Good {{structural}} design {{is important in}} most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: {{the only way to}} assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be absolutely sure that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.|$|E

25|$|The Venetian Gasparo Gozzi {{was another}} Italian who {{returned}} to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose Dialoghi dell’isola di Circe (Dialogues from Circe's Island) published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses in talking to the beasts <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable (The fox and the crow, XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition {{as soon as they}} set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli’s elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno’s fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{archaeology}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about past societies {{and the development}} of the human race. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools - The Oldowan Industry. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.|$|E

500|$|Chavrusa, also spelled chavruta or havruta (Aramaic: חַבְרוּתָא, lit. [...] "friendship" [...] or [...] "companionship"), is a {{traditional}} rabbinic approach to Talmudic study in which a pair of students analyze, discuss, and debate a shared text. It is a primary learning method in yeshivas and kollels, where students often engage regular study partners of similar knowledge and ability, and is also practiced by men and boys outside the yeshiva setting, in work, home and vacation settings. The traditional phrase <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> b'chavrusa (בְחַבְרוּתָא, [...] "in chavrusa"; i.e., in partnership); the word has come by metonymy {{to refer to the}} study partner as an individual, though it would more logically describe the pair.|$|E
500|$|Within the poem, {{the narrator}} expresses his hope that his child, Hartley Coleridge, will {{experience}} a life connected to nature {{as represented by}} features typical of the Lake District, which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered. This is similar to what Coleridge's friend William Wordsworth does with the narrator of Tintern Abbey, a poem composed later that year. Many of {{the feelings of the}} narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge's sonnet [...] "To a Friend Who Asked, How I Felt When the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me". The ideas about nature in This Lime-Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education, and Hartley <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. Coleridge's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge.|$|E

SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai lets slip he too remembers what's happening, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the time loop by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and remember the alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops by slamming the door back {{in the face of the}} airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|E
