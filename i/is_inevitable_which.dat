Dimensionality reduction methods which {{work on a}} input matrix result in two dimension-reduced output matrices with usually high compression ratio since they not only allow us to represent the input matrix with smaller amount of data, but exploit intrinsic information of the original data. Frequency domain signals {{can be seen as}} a (number of frequency bands) ×(number of total frames) input matrix of dimensionality reduction methods.

The present study investigated the effects of melatonin on photosynthetic carbon (C) assimilation and plant growth in nano-ZnO stressed plants. It was found that melatonin improved the photosynthetic C assimilation in nano-ZnO stressed wheat plants, mainly due to the enhanced photosynthetic energy transport efficiency, higher chlorophyll concentration and higher activities of Rubisco and ATPases. In addition, melatonin enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes to protect the photosynthetic electron transport system in wheat leaves against the oxidative burst caused by nano-ZnO stress.

To estimate the spectra of the impulse responses, a variable step-size unconstrained MCLMS algorithm for identifying the impulse responses in a time domain [1] was extended to the frequency domain.

When evolution of discontinuities are necessary, remeshing <b>is</b> <b>inevitable,</b> <b>which</b> makes the simulation tedious and time-consuming. In order to overcome such inconveniences, the extended finite element method (XFEM) and the generalized finite element method (GFEM) were developed by incorporating special functions into the standard finite element approximation space based on partition of unity. The finite element mesh is allowed to be totally independent of the discontinuities and remeshing is totally avoided for discontinuity evolution.

The NMM models discontinuities by its dual cover system. In this paper, a detailed comparison between the NMM and the XFEM in discontinuity modeling is presented.

The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in large-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network consisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2 N resonators of different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system (qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an effective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators. ~The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of inter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of different frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is virtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This effective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with photonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR pairs of photonic qubits distributed in 2 N resonators. Numerical simulations show that it is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of four one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

Thus for an operations manager, maintaining the quality of the lot and the screening process becomes a challenging task, when his objective is to determine the optimal order quantity for the inventory system.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to propose a new method called Optimized Threshold-Based Wavelet De-noising technique (OTWD) to de-noise hydrological time series and improve the prediction accuracy while the DDM is being used. For this purpose, in the first step, Wavelet-ANN (WNN) model was developed for identifying suitable wavelet function and maximum decomposition level. Afterward, sub-signals of original precipitation time series which were determined in the first step were de-noised by using of OTWD technique. Therefore, these clean sub-signals of precipitation time series were imposed as input data to the ANN to predict the precipitation one time step ahead.

Based on this princi-ple, truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliability degrees and the most trustworthy information (i. e., the truth) simultaneously.
