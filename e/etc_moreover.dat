Hosking was successful in producing a unique and careful interpretation of the gothic style which was well-suited to the 'low church sentiments' of his clients.

Most probably based on their individual activities, some of the Turkish revolutionaries fell in/out of the Sultan's definition of a Turk.

We {{report on}} the {{derivation}} of an stochastic differential equation that de-scribes the growth dynamics of solid surfaces growing from a vapor phase, such as the surfaces of aggregates grown by Electrochemical Deposition (ECD), or of those produced by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). We formulate an unified moving boundary problem that is relevant both to ECD and CVD experiments, into which we allow for fluctuations in the various processes leading to growth: surface diffusion, attachment/detachment events, and surface kinetics. By means of perturbative techniques {{we are able to}} derive a closed stochastic nonlinear differential equation for the surface profile. The equation has the form of the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and generalizations thereof. As a function of surface kinetics, the dispersion relation is modified, {{in such a way that}} the interface properties (roughness, <b>etc.)</b> change. <b>Moreover,</b> our results allow to interpret the lack of universal properties for the surface fluctuations found in many experiments as originated in the (diffusive) instabilities existing in the system prior to achieving its asymptotic state. 1 Rodolfo Cuerno and Mario Castr...|$|R
