40|$|Conventional fuels {{which are}} fast depleting, have ever {{fluctuating}} price and polluting characteristic of theirs is pushing mankind towards energies which are renewable and green. Wind {{being one of}} the renewable energies among solar, geothermal, biomass, ocean and others is being more patronized in places where wind is copious by governmental and with private partnership to generate electricity. Vertical axis rotor was selected over the horizontal ones due to its simplicity and reliability. At a selected location a prototype was built and installed. The design and development process and the need of the new type of machine will be described in this paper. This paper produces an investigational exploration of a vertical axis rotor (Savonius rotor) wind turbine adapted for household/domestic electricity generation. The model machine collects wind energy and generates a 12 volt output which is used to charge one <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>battery.</b> As a result, the home is served simultaneously by the wind turbine and the utility. The wind turbine responds well to low wind velocities and also various materials for vanes, various transmission mechanisms were also tried to evaluate the performance of the rotor...|$|E

40|$|In modern <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> trucks the <b>battery</b> is {{a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for engine cranking has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck <b>batteries</b> are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck <b>battery.</b> This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in engine cranking. In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck engine. These components are the starter battery, the starter motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A starter battery model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different engine cranking models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{challenge}} {{faced with}} the global energy situation is the growing energy demand and the strong dependence on unsustainable fossil fuels. Another concurrent issue is the adverse health and socio-economic implications of adult obesity. Human Power Generation, which uses metabolized human energy to generate electrical power, could potentially address both these challenges. The treadmill, {{one of the most}} popular exercise machines, presently consumes large amounts of energy while dissipating a majority as heat. The purpose of this thesis project was to design and develop a human powered treadmill generator and determine its power generation potential. The developed treadmill was based on a manual flatbed treadmill using an electromagnetic dynamo generator coupled to a front axle flywheel. A <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> rechargeable <b>battery</b> pack was used to store the generated energy and additional components to measure the generated power were included. The power generating potential of the generator was determined for varying belt speeds and angles of inclination, and compared with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) metabolic walking and running prediction equations to determine efficiency. The generator was able to deliver 140 W peak power for a short period of time. Regression equations related the power generated to the belt speed, covering values ranging from an average 10. 8 ± 0. 36 W at 1. 83 ± 0. 045 m/s to 90. 3 ± 3. 04 W at 2. 38 ± 0. 054 m/s. The angle of inclination did not have a significant impact on energy generation. The max average efficiency obtained for the system in this study was 37. 9 ± 2. 63 %, assuming 25 % gait efficiency. Possible applications for this concept include energy saving equipment in a gym, low-cost, simple to operate, and low maintenance solutions for developing nations, and as a tool to educate energy conservation. Also, the need for exercise in space with low gravity makes the treadmill generator a possible source for secondary power in future extraterrestrial environments...|$|R

While on the hunt for his cousin, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> handcuffs himself to Roadblock.

After a brief fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them.

40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars, adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R
