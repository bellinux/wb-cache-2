5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> of all the engines.

5|$|Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist gave {{evidence}} that he had identified magnesium hydroxide, a corrosion product, in fuel passages in one of Amana's engines. Counsel for the Department of Civil Aviation explained that evidence gathered during investigation of the crash indicated water {{in some of the}} fuel on board Amana was responsible for the corrosion products found in engines numbers 1 and 4; for the rough running of an engine heard by a number of witnesses; and for the <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> of all engines, leading to the aircraft descending to ground level. The Inquiry heard evidence from the Department of Civil Aviation's Acting Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, C.A.J. Lum, a former RAAF Douglas Dakota pilot, who described his personal experience of a flight in 1946 in which all fuel tanks were checked for the presence of water prior to take-off and the flight proceeded normally for 20 minutes until both engines began running roughly. Lum returned to the aerodrome and checked again for water in the tanks, this time finding a significant amount of water. Counsel for the Vacuum Oil Co. explained that it was almost impossible for water to be introduced to an aircraft during refuelling, and vigorously rejected the theory that water in the fuel contributed to the crash.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August 2010, an Airbus A321-231 (registration G-MEDJ) {{en route}} from Khartoum to Beirut as flight BD996 {{suffered}} a serious electrical malfunction which caused the <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> of the captain and co-pilot's electronic displays together with the uncommanded application of left rudder trim. The latter caused the aircraft to stray 20 nautical miles off course. The aircraft was cruising at 36,000ft at the time, with both autopilot and autothrust engaged. The captain ultimately disengaged both and flew the aircraft manually, landing in Beirut without further mishap. Airbus indicated that an electrical power interruption had occurred which had caused a reset of the Flight Augmentation Computer (FAC). Such an event may cause a small incremental offset of the rudder trim, according to the aircraft manufacturer. The Air Accidents Investigations Board (AAIB) subsequently issued Safety Recommendation 2010-092, recommending that Airbus alert all operators of A320 series aircraft {{of the possibility that}} an electrical malfunction may not be clearly annunciated on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring system (ECAM) and that such an event may lead to an uncommanded input of rudder trim.|$|E

On the one hand, {{consumers}} might claim warranty due to misuse and/or failures caused by other human factors. Such claims might {{account for more than}} 10 % of all reported claims; on the other hand, consumers might not be bothered to claim warranty for failed items that are still under warranty, or claim warranty after they have experienced several <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures.</b> These two types of human factors can affect warranty claim costs. However, research in this area has received rather little attention. In this paper, we propose three models to estimate the expected warranty cost when the two types of human factors are included. We consider two types of <b>failures,</b> <b>intermittent</b> and fatal <b>failures,</b> which might result in different claim patterns. Consumers might report claims after a fatal failure has occurred, and upon <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures</b> they might report claims after a number of failures have occurred. Numerical examples are given to validate the results derived. EPSR...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>failures</b> and nondeterministic {{behavior}} complicate {{and compromise}} {{the effectiveness of}} software testing and debugging. To increase the observability of software faults, we explore the effect hardware configurations and processor load have on <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures</b> and the nondeterministic behavior of software systems. We conducted a case study on Mozilla Firefox with a selected set of reported field failures. We replicated the conditions that caused the reported failures ten times on each of nine hardware configurations by varying processor speed, memory, hard drive capacity, and processor load. Using several observability tools, we found that hardware configurations that had less processor speed and memory observed more failures than others. Our results also show that by manipulating processor load, we can influence the observability of some faults.

40|$|AbstractContinuous {{growth in}} modern {{avionics}} systems complexity allows {{the extension of}} the functionality of flight control and navigation systems and leads to an increase in operating expenses. Currently, avionics maintenance costs approximately 30 % of the total aircraft maintenance costs. Great impact on the avionics maintenance cost has high rate of <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures,</b> which has been estimated as approximately 50 % in military avionics. Here, a mathematical reliability model of continuously tested LRU subject to permanent and <b>intermittent</b> <b>failures</b> is developed. Mathematical expressions for availability of redundant systems are derived considering the spare part system sufficiency. A detailed analysis of the three different variants of the breakdown maintenance strategy (BMS) of modern avionics systems is presented. A criterion of optimizing the number of spare parts is proposed. Some considerations for choosing the optimum variant of the BMS are outlined...|$|R

50|$|Early {{owners of}} the Nano voiced concern about an <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> to eject (FTE) while using lower quality {{ammunition}} with 115 grain bullets. Many pragmatic users of the Nano counter that 115 grain ammunition would seldom, if ever, see service in the Nano as it is employed to its intended purpose of a concealed carry defensive weapon. Many add that the Nano is rated for 9mm+P ammunition, and as such requires ammunition heavier than 115 grains to function as designed. Most Nano owners agree that the pistol functions best on ammunition with bullets of 124 grains or heavier.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of {{reliable}} fault diagnostics for <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> modes {{are an important}} tool to adequately deal with realistic failure behavior within complex systems. A large proportion of previous work utilizing model-based fault diagnostics has focused on persistent faults and often neglects the case where the system intermittently switches between a faulty and non-faulty behavior at discrete random intervals. Such intermittent behavior complicates the diagnostics task, with difficulties in detecting and isolating intermittent faults, which occur with low frequency but yet at high enough frequency to be unacceptable. Accurate assessment of <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> probabilities is critical to diagnosing and repairing equipment and requires the development of models to describe {{the dynamics of the}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure.</b> This paper presents an overall framework for detecting sensor faults, through the use of nonlinear unknown input observers which are applicable to both persistent and intermittent faults.

40|$|AbstractIn fault {{diagnosis}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> models {{are an important}} tool to adequately deal with realistic failure behavior. Current model-based diagnosis approaches account {{for the fact that}} a component cj may fail intermittently by introducing a parameter gj that expresses the probability the component exhibits correct behavior. This component parameter gj, in conjunction with a priori fault probability, is used in a Bayesian framework to compute the posterior fault candidate probabilities. Usually, information on gj is not known a priori. While proper estimation of gj can be critical to diagnostic accuracy, at present, only approximations have been proposed. We present a novel framework, coined Barinel, that computes estimations of the gj as integral part of the posterior candidate probability computation using a maximum likelihood estimation approach. Barinel's diagnostic performance is evaluated for both synthetic systems, the Siemens software diagnosis benchmark, as well as for real-world programs. Our results show that our approach is superior to reasoning approaches based on classical persistent failure models, as well as previously proposed <b>intermittent</b> <b>failure</b> models...|$|E
