25|$|Many geometrids have slender abdomens {{and broad}} wings {{which are usually}} held flat with the hind wings visible. As such, they appear rather butterfly-like, but in most respects they are typical moths; the {{majority}} fly at night, they possess a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They tend to blend into the background, often with intricate, wavy patterns on their wings. In some species, females have reduced wings (e.g. winter moth and <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm).</b>|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed {{on a large}} {{variety of}} {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, including Ulmus, Fraxinus and Acer. Other recorded hosts include hackberry, oak, {{various members of the}} rose family, walnut and willow. The larvae hatch and are active in the spring. These insects are called <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworms</b> because the females emerge from the soil in November, mate and lay their eggs in clusters on hardwood trees.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{and ground}} surveys {{to detect and}} {{evaluate}} forest insect and disease conditions in North Dakota were made during June 1977 by personnel from the U. S. Forest Service, Forest Insect and Disease Management staff and the Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station. A forest tent caterpillar outbreak in the Turtle Mountains was estimated to cover 195, 000 acres in this popular vacation area. Siberian elm shelterbelts throughout the state were heavily defoliated by the spring and <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworms.</b> Cottonwood trees along the Missouri River near Bismarck were dying {{from a combination of}} soil compaction and possible nitrogen poisoning in cattle feedlots. Dutch elm disease was evident in six American elm trees near Lisbon...|$|R
40|$|Arthropod predators use {{environmental}} cues such as kairomones {{to locate}} herbivore prey. Several {{species have been}} shown to be attracted to volatiles emitted by herbivore host plants, as well as olfactory cues produced by the herbivore. Calosoma wilcoxi is a voracious predator that specializes on lepidopteran larvae often found in the forest canopy, showing a preference for the <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm.</b> It is unknown whether C. wilcoxi uses olfactory cues associated with prey or their host plants to locate foraging sites. The objective of this study is to use <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm</b> frass, caterpillars, damaged oak leaves, and conspecifics to determine if C. wilcoxi uses olfaction to located prey...|$|E
40|$|Cankerworms, {{also known}} as inchworms, are in the order Lepidoptera and family Geometridae. Geometrid moth adults have slender bodies and {{relatively}} large, broad forewings (Figs. 1, 3). Both fall, Alsophila pometaria, and spring, Paleacrita vernata, cankerworms occur in Utah, with the <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm</b> being most common...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Chronic {{defoliation}} by the <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm,</b> Alsophila pomelaria (Harris), accompanied substantial {{increases in}} the stream export of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N) from three mixed hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians. These integrated results clearly demonstrate a measurable effect of insect qpn-sumers on ecosystem processes, and provide support for the regulatory importance of insects on a landscape scale...|$|E
40|$|Arthropod predators {{often use}} prey and conspecific cues to make {{foraging}} decisions. Calosoma wilcoxi (Leconte) is a voracious predatory beetle that specializes on lepidopteran larvae {{often found in}} the forest canopy, including the <b>fall</b> <b>cankerworm.</b> This study tested the hypothesis that C. wilcoxi uses olfactory cues to detect prey and conspecifics. A Y-tube olfactometer {{was used to test}} attractiveness to larvae, larval frass, conspecific cues, and volatiles from herbivore-damaged white oak leaves. C. wilcoxi did not preferentially choose the treatment in any of the experiments. There was no difference in mean time spent in the treatment or control arm for any of the cues assayed. The time to choose the treatment was significantly shorter in the female conspecific experiment only. I found no evidence that C. wilcoxi uses olfaction to locate prey; however, C. wilcoxi is attracted to conspecifics. C. wilcoxi may use conspecific cues to make informed foraging decisions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fall</b> <b>cankerworm</b> (FCW) {{outbreaks}} {{have recently}} increased in frequency and intensity in the mid-Atlantic {{region of the}} United States, especially around cities of Charlotte, NC and Richmond, VA. This study evaluated the effects of two landscape features associated with urbanization, impervious surface and forest cover, on population patterns of FCW and its parasitoids across eastern Virginia. Forest cover {{was positively related to}} parasitism rates while impervious surface was positively related to FCW abundance, suggesting that FCW outbreaks may be amplified in urban areas. FCW abundance declined over the two-year period of this study, but parasitism rate increased at most sites. Parasitism was highest at sites that experienced FCW outbreaks first, indicating that parasitoid populations are responding to moth abundances. It {{remains to be seen whether}} this outbreak was an aberrant occurrence, or represents a regime shift to more frequent defoliation in Virginia, similar to that in North Carolina urban areas...|$|E
