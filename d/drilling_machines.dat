25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast linear {{speed of the}} cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E

500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental {{results show that the}} environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E

2500|$|Holes {{through a}} PCB are {{typically}} drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide. Coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high RPM and high feed to be cost effective. Drill bits must also remain sharp {{so as not}} to mar or tear the traces. Drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards. The drilling is performed by automated <b>drilling</b> <b>machines</b> with placement controlled by a drill tape or drill file. These computer-generated files are also called numerically controlled drill (NCD) files or [...] "Excellon files". The drill file describes the location and size of each drilled hole.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} machine tools in industry except lathe and frais <b>machine.</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> has an important role on production proceses. But, vibration while drilling operation that caused by chatter or machine faults made the product output failure. One of the machine faults types is mass unbalance that can reduce the quality of product geometry. Therefore, dynamic behaviour analyze is necessary to prevent this mass unbalance will not happen. So, we did the dynamic behaviour analyze of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> used ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench. The aim of this research is to find out the natural frequency and the mode shape of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> could to display their mode shape deformation with damping caused by excitation forces 100 N, and could to display FRF and FFT graphics caused by mass unbalance. In order to achieve the aims, modal analysis method has been adopted. Here, principal structures and their material which influence the stiffness of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled used SolidWork 2007 software. The <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled in three configuration of head body position. Software ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench used to determine FRF. As the results, the different configuration of head body position has been influence the dynamic behaviour structure that can be signed with the different of natural frequency. More higher the natural frequency, more higher the stiffness and it’s allow the structure difficult to vibrate. From the FRF, we know that the increase operation rotation of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> allow higher vibration velocity that caused by mass unbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
