25|$|In Ireland, the new {{postal code}} system {{launched}} in 2015, known as Eircode provides a unique code for each <b>individual</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} digits are the routing key, {{which is a}} postal {{district}} and the last four characters are a unique identifier which relates to an <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> (business, house or apartment).|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E
50|$|These are all {{examples}} of group addresses, {{as opposed to}} individual addresses; the least significant bit of the first octet of a MAC <b>address</b> distinguishes <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> from group addresses. That bit is set to 0 in <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> and set to 1 in group addresses. Group <b>addresses,</b> like <b>individual</b> <b>addresses,</b> can be universally administered or locally administered.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1981, the 3033 and 3081 {{processors}} added [...] "extended real addressing", {{which allowed}} 26-bit addressing for physical storage (but still imposed a 24-bit limit for any <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> space). This capability appeared later on other systems, {{such as the}} 4381 and 3090.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Capita {{were awarded}} the {{contract}} to introduce postcodes to the Republic of Ireland. The Irish communications minister has welcomed the implementation saying that the Irish code {{is the first in}} the world to be unique to each <b>individual</b> <b>address.</b> The scheme was launched in July 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The IEEE Registration Authority is the {{administrative}} {{body that is}} responsible for registering and administering Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) and other types of identifiers which are used in the computer and electronics industries (<b>Individual</b> <b>Address</b> Blocks (IAB), Manufacturer IDs, Standard Group MAC Addresses, Unique Registration Numbers (URN), EtherType values, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Philosophy Society {{regularly}} invites notable speakers {{to deliver}} <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> to the Society. In recent years these speakers have included include Robert Fisk, Holocaust survivor Tomi Reichental, Norman Finkelstein, Professor Richard Swinburne and Professor Noam Chomsky.|$|R
25|$|Postal {{codes are}} usually {{assigned}} to geographical areas. Sometimes codes {{are assigned to}} <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> or to institutions that receive large volumes of mail, e.g. government agencies or large commercial companies. One example is the French Cedex system.|$|R
50|$|Although postal {{codes are}} usually {{assigned}} to geographical areas, special codes are sometimes assigned to <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> or to institutions that receive {{large volumes of}} mail, such as government agencies and large commercial companies. One example is the French CEDEX system.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>Individual</b> <b>Address</b> Block (IAB) was a 24-bit OUI {{managed by}} the IEEE Registration Authority, {{followed}} by 12 IEEE-provided bits (identifying the organization), and 12 bits for the owner to assign to individual devices. An IAB is ideal for organizations requiring fewer than 4097 unique 48-bit numbers (EUI-48). IAB's have been replaced with 12-bit [...] "MA-S" [...] address blocks.|$|E
50|$|Decoders are {{designated}} mfx and {{can communicate with}} the controller, dynamically negotiating an <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> and passing the locomotive description and all available functions to the controller. All control parameters are retained by the decoder in firmware and adjusted using the controller or computer. mfx decoders can also interpret the older Motorola format and so will work with previous central units.|$|E
50|$|Distributel {{offers several}} High Speed Internet plans, capped and unlimited, through a Cable or DSL connection. Its {{download}} speeds range from 6 Mbps to 50 Mbps under DSL, and 5 Mbps to 250 Mbps under Cable. The company has developed proprietary software which {{allows it to}} suggest the best underlying service and plan based on each customer's <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> and household needs. Distributel currently offers Internet service in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.|$|E

50|$|Asti is his {{experimental}} novel {{which is}} considered as his attempt of modern novel. The novel {{does not have any}} plot and is centred around an unnamed <b>individual</b> <b>addressed</b> as “Te” (lit. He) who passes through ugly experience of existence and desires death.|$|R
50|$|Use {{of either}} NetBIOS or LLMNR {{services}} on Windows is essentially automatic, since using standard DNS client API's {{will result in}} the use of either NetBIOS or LLMNR depending on what name is being resolved (whether the name is a local name or not), the network configuration in effect (e.g. DNS suffixes in effect) and (in corporate networks) the policies in effect (whether LLMNR or NetBIOS are disabled), although developers may opt into bypassing these services for <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> lookups.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911, Alfred and Harriette {{were living}} in Wandsworth with their 5-year-old daughter, Barbara Garth Jones. The census of that year records that Harriette had by this time given birth to two children. Brian Garth Jones {{had been born in}} 1902 but had died aged four. The census forms in the United Kingdom were then {{required}} to be completed by the head of the household, for that <b>individual</b> <b>address,</b> and this document bears the name and signature [...] "Alfred Garth Jones".|$|E
50|$|Still Noida villages lacks in {{permanent}} postal and <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> {{but according to}} officials, the homes in villages will be soon mapped using aerial imagery captured by drones designed by North East Centre for Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR), an autonomous society set up under the Union government's department of science and technology. These maps will also provide crucial information about rural areas in an emergency. Officials said it will take almost a year to complete mapping and allotting address to all 81 villages.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{interleaving}} {{is a way}} {{to distribute}} <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> over memory modules. Its aim is to keep the most of modules busy as computations proceed. With memory interleaving, the low-order k bits of the memory address generally specify the module on several buses.|$|R

50|$|From 1870 onward, {{after passing}} an exam, woman over 18 years {{were allowed to}} work in {{treasury}} and post offices. The Hungarian Post {{was one of the}} founding members of the Universal Postal Union in 1874. From 1885 smaller packages were delivered directly to <b>individual</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|KNX is a fully {{distributed}} network, which accommodates up to 65,536 {{devices in}} a 16 bit <b>Individual</b> <b>address</b> space. The logical topology or sub network structure allows 256 devices on one line. As shown below, lines {{may be grouped}} together with a main line into an area. Up to 15 Lines can be connected to a main line via a line coupler (LC) {{for a total of}} 16 lines. The line couplers used to establish the lines from main line 1 have physical addresses from 1.1.0 to 1.15.0. 15 lines form an area. An entire domain is formed by 15 areas together with a backbone line using backbone/area couplers.|$|E
50|$|There are {{scenarios}} {{in which}} a single address submitted by a PI may be expanded by a PPG into multiple addresses for delivery. In addition, a single address transmitted on a wireless network may be received by multiple devices (e.g. broadcast). This type of service is expected for the distribution of information of interest to a broad population (e.g. news, weather, and traffic). This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations involving multicast and broadcast addresses. Since the address expansion {{is done in the}} PPG or in the wireless network, the behaviour between the PI and the PPG is identical to behaviour as if the address were not expanded. The response contains the <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> as submitted by the PI.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Individual</b> <b>Address</b> Block (IAB) is a {{block of}} {{identifiers}} that is formed by concatenating a 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) that {{is owned by the}} IEEE Registration Authority with an additional 12-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority and then reserving an additional 12 bits for use by the assignee. The resulting 48-bit identifier uniquely identifies the assignee of the IAB and provides 4096 unique EUI-48 numbers for use by the organization that purchased the IAB. The assignee may create unique identifiers by concatenating a 12-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchases the IAB in the bit positions occupied by the 12 additional bits mentioned previously. The purpose of the IAB is to allow organizations to purchase smaller blocks of identifiers.|$|E
50|$|The Law Society also {{regularly}} invites notable speakers {{to deliver}} <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> to the Society. Recent guests given the honour of address include former Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell in October 2009 {{and the former}} lead prosecutor of Slobodan Milosevic, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC in March 2010.|$|R
50|$|They listed household, business, society, and Government {{contacts}} in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney including some {{rural areas of}} Victoria and New South Wales from the 1850s. City directories are an important resource for historical research, allowing <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> and occupations {{to be linked to}} specific streets and suburbs.|$|R
5000|$|Auxiliary paper-tape readers {{could be}} {{attached}} to a Flexowriter to create an early form of [...] "mail merge", where a long custom-created tape containing <b>individual</b> <b>addresses</b> and salutations was merged with a closed-loop form-letter and printed on continuous-form letterhead; both tapes contained embedded [...] "control characters" [...] to switch between readers.|$|R
