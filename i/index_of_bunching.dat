40|$|The {{study was}} to {{identify}} the best strains of the Quebranta variety cultivated in Peruvian region of Ica during campaigns 2011 to 2014. The evaluations were conducted in fourteen vineyards and the criteria to evaluate each one of them was that the same owner vineyard, would identify the best strain Quebranta for their good performance and sanitary quality. Productive parameters as grape weight and number <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> per vine, average cluster weight, length and width of cluster and Berry weight were evaluated. Within the parameters of vegetative growth was assessed Ravaz index and as parameter for the composition of the grape was evaluated the concentration soluble solids (°Brix), total acidity and pH. Four phenological stages were recorded and defined from observed events in the branch of the year: Phase I comprising bud of winter to sprouting; Phase II of sprouting to full bloom; Phase III of full bloom to veraison and Phase IV of veraison to maturity. At the time of fruit setting were taken leaf samples to assess the State of health of each strain to Grapevine fanleaf virus, Grapevine fleck virus, Grapevine leafroll virus 1, Grapevine leafroll virus 3 and Tomato ringspot virus. The variables average bunch weight (22 %), berry weight (20 %), bunch length (13 %) and bunch width (11 %) presented the lowest values coefficient of variation. The variables of weight of grape per vine (52 %), number <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> (42 %) and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> Ravaz (60 %) has the highest values of coefficient of variation. Four variables were used that showed lower values (25 %) coefficient of variation for the weighted average. The variables that presented perfect correlation were berry weight and width <b>of</b> <b>bunch,</b> berry weight and Ravaz <b>index,</b> length <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> and Ravaz <b>index.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> conglomerate allowed to group the strains in study in two groups which showed a significant difference between them (p < 0. 0001). The principal component analysis identified that the variable <b>of</b> weight per <b>bunch,</b> <b>index</b> Ravaz and berry weight distinguished the 77 strains studied. Soluble solids, acidity and pH of the grapes from the fourteen vineyards present significant difference. The phenology of the 77 study strains does not present significant difference. Samples of tender leaves were used for virus scanning. Only the variables of length and width <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> showed a coefficient of variation acceptable accuracy. The weighted average analysis allowed choosing the best strains which are: QT 1; QT 5; QCH 2; QCH 3; QYJ 1; QT 2; QT 3; QYJ 4; QT 4; QCH 1 which will serve as base material for future certifications and improvement of this variety. The variables such as the number <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> and bunch width feature the highest perfect correlation (0. 89 %). The grape presented in average 24. 67 °Brix, acidity 4. 14  g/L tartaric acid and 3. 92 of pH. The phenological period total average of the 77 strains was 202 days and shows no significant difference. The results of the analysis of virus were negative for the 77 strains and for the five viruses that were analyzed...|$|R

For simplicity, we use two-diffusional solution field and one-dimensional vicinal face.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explain the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around kink {{points in the}} tax schedule, and {{investigate}} whether such bunching may be occurring at the kink point created by the Norwegian wealth tax. I conclude that {{there seems to be}} no evidence <b>of</b> such <b>bunching,</b> after examining the distribution of taxpayers around the kink point in several ways. Theoretically, bunching at kink points should occur when there is an increase in the marginal tax rate, as the change in marginal payoff will lead to an uneven distribution of taxpayers around the kink point. This could also be further affected by different assets being treated differently for tax purposes. I present such a model, explaining the various mechanisms that affect the amount <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> and explain how it can occur. There have been other studies <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with some that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> and some that did not. Very few such studies have examined wealth taxation, with the exception of a recent Swedish study (Seim 2012) that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around a kink point created by the Swedish wealth tax. No such studies have been previously done for Norway, however. Examining tax data for the year 2012, I observe that the distribution of taxpayers appears to have no trace <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with various methods for observing potential bunching leading to the same conclusion. Furthermore, a look at the composition of wealth gave no indication that taxpayers responded to the wealth tax at all around the kink. It is particularly difficult to point to any strong reason for the different findings, given the similarity between Norway and Sweden in most aspects related to taxation. There are some methodological differences however, that are worth taking into account...|$|R
