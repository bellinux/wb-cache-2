Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts.

The model manages documents which consist {{of the institute}} library from their creation to the archive state.

To solve network delay, we propose both local and online document synchronized editing model. In addition, we combine the longest recursive chain with recursive chain time to optimize the system response time. In order to optimize documents to be deleted, we propose a two-step optimized method. In the performance test, {{the effectiveness of the}} method is confirmed to solve the issues of <b>documents</b> <b>management.</b> Keywords-synchronized editing modely; version storage optimization; deletion strategy; two-step optimized method; I...|$|R
