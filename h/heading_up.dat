5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

5|$|Faversham was {{established}} as a settlement before the Roman conquest. The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham, with traffic through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> Watling Street to London. The town was less than 10 miles from Canterbury, and consequently Faversham had become established on this road network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD. Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham, including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794. In 2013, {{the remains of a}} 2,000-year-old Roman theatre, able to accommodate some 12,000 people, were discovered at a hillside near the town. The cockpit-style outdoor auditorium, {{the first of its kind}} found in Britain, was a style the Romans used elsewhere in their empire on the Continent.|$|E

5|$|The Judy Garland Show was {{initially}} {{slated to be}} taped in New York City. The network initially offered the producer's job to Bob Banner, {{who was at the}} time producing a series for Garry Moore. Although he was interested, he declined to relocate from the West Coast. Bob Finkel, whose credits included shows for Dinah Shore and Andy Williams, was next approached but similarly refused to relocate. Veteran producer and director Bill Hobin, then <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> Sing Along with Mitch, was approached to produce and direct the program. Already based in the East, Hobin eagerly accepted. Unbeknownst to Hobin, George Schlatter had been lobbying on the West Coast for the producer job and was signed to produce. Ultimately Hobin bowed out of the producer slot and Schlatter became the producer while Hobin was retained to direct.|$|E
5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> the march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E

5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Christian Cage. On January 6, 2008 at TNA's previous PPV event Final Resolution, Angle defeated Cage to retain the championship after Cage's alliance A.J. Styles attacked Cage, aligning with Angle and The Angle Alliance. On the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Cage, Joe, and Styles would compete in a Three Way match on the January 17, 2008 episode of Impact!. Stipulations for the match were that the winner would get a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Angle at Against All Odds, however if Styles won he could choose instead of the title match to allow Angle to not have to defend his title for two months. Cage ended up winning the contest, thus becoming the number one contender. On the January 24, 2008 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Joe would be the Special Outside Enforcer at Against All Odds due him being controversially disqualified during the match. Also connected to the storyline was the allegiance of former Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance member Tomko to either Cage or Angle. <b>Heading</b> <b>up</b> to the match, Tomko explained he was not on either's side, despite being one-half of the TNA World Tag Team Champions with Styles. On the January 31, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage. This resulted in Tomko and Cage seeming {{to be on the}} same page on the February 7, 2008 episode of Impact!.|$|E
