500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that Erica was being written out of Grey's Anatomy, Smith was asked whether she was happy with the direction the storyline had taken. She responded: [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> get there, yeah. I was personally a little impatient with the gay panic, {{but it was more}} Callie's thing anyway. I think Dr. Hahn was sort of figuring it out."

500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England."

500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E

Moss played rhythm guitar by plugging an acoustic guitar into the bass player's amplifier. The Scene played at local centres and organised their own dances. Moss sang a couple of songs with the group and a year later, he bought an electric guitar to replace his acoustic.

2500|$|In 2006, EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan revealed {{how it was}} {{his idea}} to bring Den back in 2003. Jordan had started working at EastEnders in 1989, after Den had already left the series. Jordan {{had always wanted to}} write material for Den and Angie and so he campaigned for the return of Den for many years. He told the Daily Mirror, [...] "At story conferences I'd say, 'How do we know he's dead? They never found a body'. Eventually, just to shut me up, they made me write an episode where Den's body was found and identified by his ring." [...] Jordan finally got his way in 2003; however, according to the writer, Leslie Grantham's internet sex scandal spelled the demise of the character. Commenting on this, Jordan said, [...] "If [...] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2016, {{the band}} {{were forced to}} cancel their {{headlining}} slot at the annual KROQ Weenie Roast, as Kiedis {{was rushed to the}} hospital prior to the band appearing on stage. It was confirmed that Kiedis was suffering from intestinal flu and was expected to make a full recovery soon however the band was forced to postpone their iHeartRadio album preview show on May 17, 2016 (rescheduling it for May 26). Kiedis and the Chili Peppers returned to the stage on May 22, 2016 in Columbus, OH. According to the band's drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis was suffering from a stomach flu a few weeks earlier and it had returned on the night they were set to perform. In a May 20, 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada, his first since being released from the hospital, Kiedis said that his illness was brought on by an [...] "inflammation in my guts" [...] which he said was complicated by a recent stomach virus and existing scar tissue from previous hernia operations which required his stomach being pumped at the hospital due to his food not being able to properly digest. [...] "That becomes an incredibly painful situation where you get a fever and pass out... Lo an behold, I'm on the mend" [...] He went on to say [...] "so it turned out to be a good thing, albeit painful and very sad to have to cancel a show. We don't really do that. I'd rather play deathly ill than not play at all, but in this particular instance, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> go down, as in to the ground, so I got rushed to the hospital, got some help, and now I get to figure things out." ...|$|E

Initial reception was warm with the song reaching number 9 in the US and number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, though the violent depictions spelled out by Jagger {{were believed to be}} why its popularity quickly waned. Jagger in Jump Backs liner notes: [...] "I think its really good but it wasnt particularly successful at the time because songs that deal overtly with politics never are that successful, for some reason." [...] Richards countered: [...] "There were a lot more overlays on this track, because {{there was a lot more}} separation in the way we were recording at that time.

At any rate, somebody gave the tip, and at about three o'clock this morning I was aroused from a dreamless slumber by quite a considerable hammering at my door. There, standing on the mat, were two policemen. Very cordially the honest fellows invited me to go with them. A conveyance, it seemed, waited in the street without. I disclaimed all connection with the bad gambling persons below, but they replied that they were cleaning up the house, and, if I wished to make any remarks, I had better make them to the magistrate. This seemed reasonable. I said I would put on some clothes and come along. They demurred. They said they couldn't wait about while I put on clothes. I pointed out that sky-blue pajamas with old-rose frogs were not the costume in which the editor of a great New York weekly paper should be seen abroad in one of the world's greatest cities, but they assured me--more by their manner than their words--that my misgivings were groundless, so I yielded. These men, I told myself, have lived longer in New York than I. They know what is done, and what is not done. I will bow to their views. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> go with them like a lamb, when one of them gave me a shove in the ribs with his night stick.

Mine'--he glanced at a great tan bag by the fire-place--'was the beginner's friend--the cleek. Well, sir, this golf {{proposition}} took a holt of me as quick as--quick as death. They had to prise me off the greens when it got too dark to see, and then {{we went back to the}} house. I was walkin' ahead with my Lord Marshalton talkin' beginners' golf. (I was the man who ought to have been killed by rights.) We cut 'cross lots through the woods to Flora's Temple--that place I showed you this afternoon. Lundie and Walen were, maybe, twenty or thirty rod behind us in the dark. Marshalton and I stopped at the theatre to admire at the ancestral yew-trees. He took me right under the biggest--King Somebody's Yew--and while I was spannin' it with my handkerchief, he says, [...] "Look heah!" [...] just as if it was a rabbit--and down comes a bi-plane into the theatre with no more noise than the dead. My Rush Silencer is the only one on the market that allows that sort of gumshoe work.... What? A bi-plane--with two men in it. Both men jump out and start fussin' with the engines. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> tell Mankeltow--I can't remember to call him Marshalton any more--that it looked as if the Royal British Flying Corps had got on to my Rush Silencer at last; but he steps out from under the yew to these two Stealthy Steves and says, [...] "What's the trouble? Can I be of any service?" [...] He thought--so did I--'twas some of the boys from Aldershot or Salisbury. Well, sir, from there on, the situation developed like a motion-picture in Hell. The man on the nigh side of the machine whirls round, pulls his gun and fires into Mankeltow's face. I laid him out with my cleek automatically. Any one who shoots a friend of mine gets what's comin' to him if I'm within reach. He drops. Mankeltow rubs his neck with his handkerchief. The man the far side of the machine starts to run. Lundie down the ride, or it might have been Walen, shouts, [...] "What's happened?" [...] Mankeltow says, [...] "Collar that chap." ...|$|E
