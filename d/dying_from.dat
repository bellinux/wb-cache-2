5|$|Although well received, the series' {{ratings were}} not {{high enough to}} warrant a third series. After its {{cancellation}} in September 1997, Davies had an existential crisis after almost <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and {{make a name for}} himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is thought}} to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> cancer. This effect is {{particularly}} beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC). It may also slightly {{reduce the risk of}} endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to their high life expectancy, islanders are noted for their low mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Wilcox (2007) compared age-adjusted mortality of Okinawans versus Americans and found that, during 1995, an average Okinawan was 8 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> coronary heart disease, 7 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> prostate cancer, 6.5 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> breast cancer, and 2.5 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> colon cancer than an average American of the same age.|$|R
5|$|By the 18th century, {{smallpox}} was endemic in Europe. There {{were five}} epidemics in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By {{the end of}} the century about 400,000Europeans were <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> the disease each year. It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia. In the 19th century, smallpox became the single most important cause of death of the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} is {{less common}} than carotid artery dissection (dissection {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two conditions together account for 10–25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in August 1591, Hues joined Cavendish {{on another}} attempt to {{circumnavigate}} the globe. Sailing on the Leicester, they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the Desire. Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the Strait of Magellan between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, as Davis intended to sail to America {{to search for the}} Northwest Passage. The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands. In the meantime, delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> the cold, illness and starvation, Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England. He was plagued by mutinous crewmen, and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore. Increasingly depressed, Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, possibly a suicide.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E

5|$|Laurie Mains had {{returned}} from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 National Provincial Championship (NPC), and was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 30–28 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams. The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> cancer in 2001. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 15–3 at half time, and eventually won 20–13. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders' 40–26 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. The Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch where they lost 34–23, although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the drummer}} landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a cameo in Frank Zappa's 200 Motels as a nun afraid of <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> a drug overdose. Although {{it only took}} 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon {{spending}} off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a holiday camp during {{the early days of}} British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's That'll Be the Day. He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, Stardust, and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of Tommy. Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's Sextette with Starr and Alice Cooper. This was the last film to star Mae West.|$|E
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
