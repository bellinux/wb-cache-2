5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E

5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{is said to}} be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|During his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> Williams and his {{government}} suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams and {{his government}} dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams {{and his government}} remained high.

5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Clinton {{consistently}} supported {{ratification of the}} treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton {{and most of his}} allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E

50|$|The Liberal-Conservatives {{were also}} {{suffering}} severe internal divisions. During his <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Bennett had alienated those {{in his party}} who supported intervention in the economy.

5|$|While at Landsberg, Hitler {{dictated}} most of {{the first}} volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came in his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|In his <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Clarke {{established}} {{good order}} in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble {{so long as the}} policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E

As such, Domitila was offered a job working with the Ministry of the Interior, with wages higher than her husband’s and {{benefits}} for her children. She declined, fearing that her image as a barzola would make others question the loyalty of the Housewives’ Committee to the workers.|$|R
500|$|Richard von Weizsäcker {{took office}} as President on 1 July 1984. In his inaugural address, he appealed to his nation's special consciousness, saying: [...] "Our situation, which {{differs from that}} of most other nations, is no reason to deny {{ourselves}} a national consciousness. To do so would be unhealthy for ourselves and eerie to our neighbors." [...] He dedicated his <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> mainly to foreign policy, travelling widely with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and choosing former Foreign Office employees as his personal advisors.|$|R
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> ended with no fiscal deficit; {{the first time this}} had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them. These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E

25|$|Antisemitism {{was officially}} {{enforced}} under the premierships of Ion Brătianu. During his <b>first</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> (1875) Brătianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews {{were not allowed}} to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be vagrants and expelling them from the country. The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878. By 1900 there were 250,000 Romanian Jews: 3.3% of the population, 14.6% of the city dwellers, 32% of the Moldavian urban population and 42% of Iași.|$|R

Bush's <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The budget submitted by George W.

It also examines the most recent government White Paper on social mobility, New Opportunities: Fair Chances for the Future, published in January 2009, and asks whether this paper represents a serious last attempt to renew the equal opportunities agenda...|$|R
