50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{attachment}} for a rotary mower, either using the three-point hitch or via a draw bar. The height of the cut on models attached on the three-point hitch is adjusted using the <b>hitch</b> <b>control</b> lever. This adjusts the height of the front of mower. For more radical height adjustment the rear wheel can also be adjusted. Typically the mowers in this category range from 3.3 to 22 ft mowing widths.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical three point hitch regulation in mouldboard ploughing. Increase of working velocity and three point hitch automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both regulation systems but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical regulation system. Electro-hydraulic three point <b>hitch</b> <b>control</b> system decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical regulation system. Net energy requirement at mechanical three point hitch regulation system spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value. The greatest working rates were achieved at the greatest working velocity (8, 0 km h- 1), while exactly at that velocity the greatest working rate increase of 3, 8 % influenced by electro-hydraulic three point <b>hitch</b> <b>control</b> was noticed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a torque-vectoring (TV) algorithm for the <b>control</b> of the <b>hitch</b> angle of an articulated vehicle. The <b>hitch</b> angle <b>control</b> function prevents trailer oscillations and instability during extreme cornering maneuvers. The proposed control variable is a weighted combination of terms {{accounting for the}} yaw rate, sideslip angle and hitch angle of the articulated vehicle. The novel control variable formulation results in a single-input single-output (SISO) feedback controller. In the specific application a simple proportional integral (PI) controller with gain scheduling on vehicle velocity is developed. The TV system is implemented and experimentally tested on a fully electric vehicle with four on-board drivetrains, towing a single-axle passive trailer. Sinusoidal steer test {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm significantly improves the behavior of the articulated vehicle, and justify further research on the topic of <b>hitch</b> angle <b>control</b> through TV...|$|R
50|$|The three-point <b>hitch</b> was <b>controlled</b> with a lever for {{adjusting}} the position, or {{as with the}} earliest ones, just the function for raising or lowering the hitch. With modern electrical systems, it is often replaced with a potentiometer for the lower bound position and another one for the upper bound, and a switch allowing automatic adjustment of the hitch between these settings.|$|R
50|$|Three-point hitches are {{composed}} of three movable arms. The two lower arms—the <b>hitch</b> lifting arms—are <b>controlled</b> by the hydraulic system, and provide lifting, lowering, and even tilting to the arms. The upper center arm—called the top link—is movable, but is usually not powered by the tractor's hydraulic system. Each arm has an attachment device to connect implements to the hitch.|$|R

40|$|Through {{the work}} of {{researchers}} {{and the development of}} commercially available products, automated guidance has become a viable option for agricultural producers. Some of the limitations of commercially available technologies are that they only automate one function of the agricultural vehicle and that the systems are proprietary to a single machine model. The objective of this project was to evaluate a controller area network (CAN bus) as the basis of an automated guidance system. The prototype system utilized several microcontroller-driven nodes to act as control points along a system wide CAN bus. Messages were transferred to the steering, transmission, and <b>hitch</b> <b>control</b> nodes from a task computer. The task computer utilized global positioning system data to determine the appropriate control commands. Infield testing demonstrated that each of the control nodes could be controlled simultaneously over the CAN bus. Results showed that the task computer adequately applied a feedback control model to the system and achieved guidance accuracy levels well within the range sought. Testing also demonstrated the system’s ability t...|$|E
40|$|This thesis titled “Modeling and Analysis of Hydraulic Load Sensing Strategies in Off Highway Equipment” {{consists}} of two parts. The first part is called “Modeling and Analysis of an Excavator System’ and {{the title of the}} second part is “Modeling and Analysis of Tractor Rear Hitch Controls. ” The topics discussed in this thesis include modeling of an excavator sytem and the modeling of an agricultural tractor’s rear hitch controls. The objectives of this thesis have been to develop a fast simulation model to replicate the functioning of an excavators system and the analysis of a tractor rear hitch controls. Both topics are of substantial importance in today’s industrial research scenario. With a large demand being placed on more intelligent development of construction and agricultural equipment to meet the changing needs of the worlds economy, this thesis offers its contribution in the meeting of these requirements.

Of 7 h FPNI-PhD Symposium Modena. FPNI Fluid Power Net Publications, 2012 PART 1 This part describes the results of a study focused on the mathematical modeling of an excavator hydraulic system. From the viewpoint of designing and tuning an efficient control system, an excavator is a very complex nonlinear plant. To design and tune such a complex control system an extremely good nonlinear model of the plant is necessary. The problem of modeling an excavator is considered in this document; a nonlinear mathematical model of an excavator has been developed using the AMESim® modeling environment to replicate actual operating conditions. The excavator model is described by detailed models of the main pump, mobile valve block, actuators and a completely developed kinematic model. The objective of this research is to develop a complete simulation model of an excavator with the capability of reproducing the actual characteristics of the system. This part presents the developed model of a complete excavator system with detailed verification of individual components and preliminary results of a complete excavator system. PART 2 This part of the thesis describes the work carried out towards mathematical modeling and analysis of a tractor rear <b>hitch</b> <b>control</b> valve (HCV). The HCV operates in two modes namely lifting and lowering. The lifting circuit incorporates a pressure compensated flow control valve, while the lowering circuit is gravity assisted. The HCV is a load-sensing system; load-sensing systems and pressure compensated valves are classified as feedback systems. Systems with feedback offer scope for tuning and towards this objective the pressure compensator has been linearised and its characteristics analyzed. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a complete mathematical model of the HCV. This would help to better understand its functionality and to quantify the energy losses across its components...|$|E

('Stazione Automatica di Controllo' - 'Automatic <b>Control</b> Station') lower <b>hitch</b> arm draft <b>control</b> system conceived by SAME, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years.

30|$|The {{current study}} {{compared}} both skills on the cognitive abilities of working memory and inhibitory control. Working memory is the {{mechanism for the}} active manipulation and storage of temporary information (Baddeley, 2003; Baddeley & <b>Hitch,</b> 1974). Inhibitory <b>control</b> involves the active suppression of an automatic or “prepotent” response or thought and is a superset of interference control and response inhibition. Working memory and inhibitory control are types of executive functions, higher-order cognitive functions involved in goal-directed behavior (Diamond, 2013; Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, Howerter, et al., 2000).|$|R
2500|$|When ordered {{with the}} factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to 5000 pounds. [...] For the station wagon, {{this could be}} raised to 7000 pounds {{with the use of}} a weight-distributing <b>hitch,</b> dual sway <b>controls,</b> setting rear tire {{pressure}} to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control. [...] The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by [...] the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} can {{be predicted}} in real-time {{by measuring the}} draught of a cutting tool, when the depth is held constant by the three-point <b>hitch</b> position <b>control</b> system of the tractor. A semi-analytical model was developed for {{the conversion of the}} voltage applied to the hydraulic subsystem of an agricultural tractor to the depth under the soil surface of an attached cutting tool (subsoiler) for online measurement of spatial variation in soil compaction. The model consisted of two distinct submodels: a model for the agricultural tractor based on a kinematic and dynamic analysis of the tractor in the XY plane and a `grey box' model for the hydraulic subsystem. The order of this `grey box' model was determined using a theoretical, mechanistic approach, while the parameters for the model structure have been determined using data-based modelling techniques. Both submodels have been coupled and successfully validated by comparing experimental results with those predicted by the model. It is concluded that the tractor dynamics are not excited by the activity of the hydraulic subsystem, when the subsoiler is attached. Therefore, a reduced model consisting of the hydraulic subsystem model multiplied by a conversion factor was found to be appropriate for the design of a depth controller for the soil compaction sensor.
