40|$|Babassu and {{camelina}} oils {{have been}} transesterified with methanol by the classical homogeneous basic catalysis method with good yields. The babassu fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) {{has been subjected}} to fractional distillation at vacuum, and the low boiling point fraction has been blended with two types of fossil kerosene, a straight-run atmospheric <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> (hydrotreated) and a commercial Jet-A 1. The camelina FAME has been blended with the fossil kerosene without previous distillation. The blends of babassu biokerosene and Jet-A 1 have met some of the specifications selected for study of the ASTM D 1655 standard: smoke point, density, flash point, cloud point, kinematic viscosity, oxidative stability and lower heating value. On the other hand, the blends of babassu biokerosene and atmospheric <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> only have met the density parameter and the oxidative stability. The blends of camelina FAME and atmospheric <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> have met the following specifications: density, kinematic viscosity at − 20 °C, and lower heating value. With these preliminary results, it can be concluded that it would be feasible to blend babassu and camelina biokerosenes prepared in this way with commercial Jet-A 1 up to 10 vol % of the former, if these blends prove to accomplish all the ASTM D 1655 - 09 standards...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the study of the}} {{volatile}} components of natural products has been enormously extended by the development of the techniques of gas-liquid chromatography. The detection, isolation, and identification of unsuspected minor components, either in the lower boiling (terpenaceous) or higher boiling (aromatic) fractions of essential oils, has provided both taxonomic assignment and insight into plausible biogenetic pathways. This latter fraction, that which is made up to a large extent of phenols and their ethers, has always proved difficult to analyze for numerous reasons. Most of the known components are oils at ordinary temperature, thus <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> rarely crystallize. If there is any complexity in the natural mixture, a continuous temperature increase is observed during distillation even with the use of efficient fractionation equipment. Secondly, there is a consistent similarity in the substitution groups present; the ether groups are invariably methoxys or methylenedioxys, and the aliphatic chain is usually found to be allyl, cis-propenyl, or tralss-propenyl. Attempts at differential extraction or partition within these <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> have been generally unsuccessful...|$|R

Four times of storage of pomace obtained following winemaking of two grape varieties of white Verde wine (Alvarinho and Loureiro) and three <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> were considered; volatile compounds in the 24 samples generated were analyzed directly, and indirectly after extraction and concentration, by capillary gas chromatography. The results generated have suggested clear differences (P< 0. 05) between distillate cuts obtained throughout fermentation times for each grape variety. The major differences between the different distillate fractions analyzed were {{accounted for by the}} contents of diethyl butanoate, ethyl 2 -hydroxypropanoate, and the sum of 3 -methylbutanoic and 2 -methylpropanoic acids for Loureiro, whereas the main differences were accounted for by the contents of diethyl butanoate and the sum of the carboxylic acids for Alvarinho...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of component types in shale oil is described. A shale oil produced from New Brunswick oil shale in a pilot scale retort is initially separated into several <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts.</b> A liquid chromatographic (LC) method employing a mixed silica gel and alumina column and n-pentane, methylene chloride, and methanol as eluting solvents is used to produce the following fractions from the higher boiling distillation cuts: saturates (containing olefins), aromatics, and polars. Further separation of the olefins from the saturates fraction is accomplished by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with flame ionization detection (FID) using silica gel chromarods coated with silver nitrate and n-hexane as the developing solvent. The saturates, olefins, aromatics, and polar components in the shale oil are quantified...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{electrospray}} ionization Fourier transform ion {{cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (ESI(±) -FT-ICR MS) was applied in the chemical characterization of polar compounds. These compounds were identified as the oxygen-containing compound classes (naphthenic acids, O 2 class, and phenols, O 1 class), the sulfur-containing compound classes (mainly sulfides, S 1 class), and the basic and non-basic nitrogen-containing compound classes (carbazoles and pyridines, N class). For access the sulfur-containing compounds were employed the methylation reactions. As the increasing of <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> temperature, the amount of O 2 compounds increased (from 9 for cut 2 to 66 for cut 12), and the average molecular weight distribution, Mw, shifted to higher m/z values (Mw= 169 → 321 Da). These results {{were consistent with the}} increase of TAN with the boiling point. Plots of the DBE versus the carbon number for the O 2 class of heavy distillation cuts (cuts 4 – 12) suggested a maximum abundance of the carbon numbers located at C 12 –C 18 with a constant DBE of 3. For the nitrogen-containing compounds, 100 compounds were detected with m/z ranging from 160 to 414. Similar to O 2 class, the amount of nitrogen species increased, and the Mw shifted for high values in function of <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> temperature: 6 species and Mw= 206 Da for cut 3; and 64 species and Mw= 340 Da for cut 12. The structures and the connectivity of naphthenic acids, phenols and pyridines were confirmed using ESI(±) -MS/MS. The most abundant sulfur compounds in heavy distillation cuts presented a carbon number of C 23 (for cut 11) and C 25 (for cut 12) with constant DBE of 3. Results of ESI(±) -FT-ICR MS contributed {{to the understanding of the}} chemical composition of Brazilian crude oil and the establishment of a correlation with the corrosion process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe size {{distribution}} of sulfur, vanadium, and nickel was determined for four crude oils and their distillation cuts using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled to {{inductively coupled plasma}} high-resolution mass spectrometry (ICP HR MS). The results show a trimodal distribution of vanadium and nickel compounds in the crude oils, the atmospheric residues, and the vacuum residues and, for sulfur compounds, either a mono- or bimodal distribution depending upon the <b>distillation</b> <b>cut</b> considered. A correlation exists between the sulfur fraction retention times and the temperature cuts of the distillation for a temperature below 560 degrees C and also between the viscosity of the crude oils {{and the proportion of}} trapped sulfur compounds in a higher boiling temperature fraction. The thermic treatment applied for the distillation increases the aggregation of low- and medium-molecular-weight compounds of vanadium and nickel into higher molecular weight aggregates between the crude oil {{on the one hand and}} the atmospheric residue and vacuum residue on the other hand, especially when the crude oil has a high total sulfur content...|$|E
40|$|Straight run naphtha {{is a basic}} {{constituent}} of refined petroleum products. It consists {{mainly of}} aliphatic hydrocarbons along with small amounts of naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. It has a wide boiling range between 95 degrees F and 410 degrees F. Currently, its main utilization is as gasoline blend, however, naphtha is a potential feedstock {{for the production of}} various petrochemicals. Continuous catalytic reforming of naphtha can produce aromatic compounds in amounts up to 70 % of the reformat. Nevertheless, the catalytic reforming process is usually associated with various limitations that {{may be related to the}} wide-ranging composition of naphtha. In this study straight run naphtha derived from Arabian Light crude oil was fractionated, and the hydrocarbon composition of its different <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> was determined. The results indicate that, straight run naphtha can be split into two main fractions. A light fraction boiling between ambient temperature and 225 degrees F, consists mainly of C- 7 ((-)) and a medium heavy fraction boiling between 225 degrees F and 335 degrees F, consists mainly of C- 7 ((+)). Detailed distillation characteristics, along with compositional analysis of SRN seems to be useful for diversifying its processin...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of elementary analysis in the distillation profile of petroleum cuts by gas phase chromatography-atomic emission detection (GC-AED) coupling and shows the application perspectives to characterisation of middle distillates {{of a piece of}} information unheard of until now on a routine basis. The performances of the analytical assembly used have been studied for carbon, hydrogen, sulphur and nitrogen analysis. Simulated distillation, a gas phase chromatography analysis which enables determining the weight percentage of distilled matter in relation to the boiling point of petroleum cuts, has been adapted to GC-AED coupling. We have developed a method giving access to three types of information: global elementary composition, simulated distillation and elementary composition in distillation profile, i. e. by fraction (%) of the distilled product. The analysis of the atmospheric distillates has been assessed in terms of precision and bias for these various types of information. The validation was carried out notably by comparison with the results obtained using reference analytical methods, on preparative <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> of representative samples. The application of GC-AED to characterisation of distillates is discussed, in particular for classification purposes and for predicting petroleum properties in the distillation profile. The cetane number of gas oils was taken as an example to illustrate the latter application...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{atmosphere}} pyrolysis of Tosco Oil Shale {{was performed}} utilizing a Chemical Data Systems 320 concentrator and a gas blending system. Flame ionization (FID) and nitrogen specific (NPD) detection {{were performed to}} determine the atmosphere which maximized hydrocarbon compound formation while minimizing nitrogen compound formation. Comparisons of FID and NPD peak areas {{as a function of}} temperature are given for 0 %, 10 %, 15 % and 30 % oxygen. The NPD peak areas, as well as the FID peak areas, are contrasted separately. ^ The initial development of a method for distinguishing condensed ring aromatic systems from alkyl substituted aromatic systems was accomplished. N, 2, 4, 6 -tetrachloroacetanilide was reacted with standards and with an aromatic fraction of shale oil. Mass spectral analysis and specific element detection (for carbon and chlorine), with a microwave emission detector (MED), were performed on the reaction products. Chlorination of alkyl groups occurred. The formation of olefins was documented, contrary to literature reports. ^ Gas and liquid chromatographic methods for several organoarsenic compounds were developed. The stability of some pentacoordinate organoarsenic compounds was investigated by thermogravimetry. The concentration of arsenic in boiling point <b>distillation</b> <b>cuts</b> of shale oil and in concentrated fractions from liquid chromatographic class separations were obtained by x-ray fluorescence and by inductively coupled plasma with hydride generation. The analysis of shale oil on the GC-MED system was attempted and although a detection limit of 0. 4 picograms/second was obtained on the arsenic 228. 8 nanometer line no arsenic species could be identified. ...|$|R
30|$|A “topping” {{refinery}} relies {{entirely on}} <b>distillation</b> to separate <b>cuts</b> {{and is the}} simplest type of refinery that can be built. Residuum is sold as a heavy fuel oil, and if vacuum distillation is available, part of the residuum could be made into asphalt. No additional processing occurs at topping refineries, {{and much of the}} output stream is sold to other refineries with additional processing capacity. Topping refineries are usually built to prepare feedstocks for petrochemical manufacture or for the production of industrial fuels in remote areas. A large portion of the production from topping refineries is straight run fuel oil.|$|R
40|$|Drying {{tea tree}} leaf on the stem {{increased}} the oil content from 5. 8 % to 7. 4 % yield v/dw. This increase {{is not a}} result of changing moisture content but appears {{to be due to}} an active form of postharvest oil uptake or production. The value to oil producers of drying and storing leaf prior to distillation is a more efficient distillation system. At present, distillation occurs {{as close as possible to}} foliage harvest with the aim of reducing any chance of oil volatilization. These results show that the need for immediate <b>distillation</b> of <b>cut</b> foliage is unnecessary, as the delay would actually improve the yield rather than reduce it. For the industry these results could change the accepted methods of production. To date each producer had to have their own distillation plant as a way of avoiding distillation delays and the need for carting wet leaf material. Since drying leaves on the stems of the tree increases the oil yield and since the removal of leaves from the stem is easily accomplished when the leaves are dried, producers need only have storage and leaf stripping facilities. This would enable pure leaf to be transferred cheaply to a central distillery when a sufficient load is achieved...|$|R
