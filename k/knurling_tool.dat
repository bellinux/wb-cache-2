So it is important to develop a new method to make a flat gear teeth by plastic deformation of the ingot. The article deals with the actual problem of improving productivity and quality of plane wheels teeth that are widely used in advanced wave, planetary and other transmissions. A progressive method to produce flat gear teeth gear by plastic deformation of the ingot with two knurl rollers alternately moving reciprocally in the direction not intersecting the axis of the ingot mounting surface has been described in the article. The working surface of the rollers corresponds to the resulting shape of the teeth. The schemes of the teeth installing and knurling have been shown. The necessary material and the heat treatment of the <b>knurling</b> <b>tools</b> have been described.  Its use will significantly increase the wear resistance of the working surfaces of the teeth and their durability as well as to increase productivity and its manufacturing costs. The material of the rollers is BC 15 steel. The surface layer of the <b>knurling</b> <b>tools</b> was subjected to nitration, surface hardness being up to 65 HRC. Knurling is made in the 5236 P shaper suited for this purpos...|$|R
40|$|Cr-WS 2 {{nanocomposite}} {{solid lubricant}} coatings were prepared on mechanically textured stainless steel substrates. Micron-sized dimples of approximately 10 - 12 µm depth and 100 × 80 µm 2 area with uniform dimple spacing of 300 µm were created on the substrates using a <b>knurling</b> <b>tool.</b> Substrate surface texturing improved the tribological properties of Cr-WS 2 nanocomposite coatings significantly. Cr-WS 2 nanocomposite coatings prepared on textured steel substrates exhibited a friction coefficient of 0. 1 after 28, 800 cycles compared to coatings prepared on non-textured substrates which exhibited a friction coefficient of 0. 45. The dimpled regions acted as solid lubricant reservoirs and also helped in trapping wear debris. The retention of solid lubricant {{material in the}} dimpled region was confirmed using field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies...|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThough {{composites}} {{are commonly}} molded for achieving near net-shape, {{they have to}} undergo precise machining {{in order to achieve}} the dimensional stability and an interface quality. A complicated interaction between polymer matrix and carbon fiber reinforcement makes the machining of the CFRP material a major concern. Due to this heterogeneous nature of the CFRP, the machined surfaces result in damages like delamination, spalling, and splintering. In order to minimize these damages, knowledge about tool replacement time or tool life is necessary. In this study an effort is made to determine the tool life for diamond interlocked <b>knurled</b> <b>tool</b> commonly used for machining CFRP material. Direct tool wear measurement techniques were inadequate to determine the tool life because of the complex geometry of this tool. Therefore, in this study indirect tool wear measurement technique is used to quantify the tool wear based on delamination. The damage caused by delamination on the CFRP material undergoing edge trimming operation is measured in the form of delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch. The effects of experimental parameters on delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch are observed to find optimized process parameters. An attempt is made to develop an empirical tool lie equation based on the combined effect of delamination depth and number of delamination occurrences per inch...|$|R
