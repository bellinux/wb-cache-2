40|$|The {{classical}} {{theory of}} rubber elasticity fails in {{the regime of}} large deformation. The un- derlying physical mechanism has been under debate for long time. In this work, we test the recently proposed mechanism of thermal elastic fluctuations by Xing, Goldbart and Radzi- hovsky 1 against the biaxial stress-strain data of three distinct polymer networks with very different network structures, synthesized by Urayama 2 and Kawabata 3 respectively. We find that both the two parameters version and the one-parameter version of the XGR theory provide satisfactory description of the elasticity in whole deformation range.

40|$|BACKGROUND Multiple breath washout (MBW) derived Scond is an {{established}} index of ventilation inhomogeneity. Time-consuming post hoc calculations of the expirogram's slope of alveolar phase III (SIII) {{and the lack}} of available software hampered widespread application of Scond. METHODS Seventy-two school-aged children (45 with cystic fibrosis; CF) performed 3 nitrogen MBW. We tested a new automated algorithm for Scond analysis (Scondauto) which comprised breath selection for SIII detection, calculation and reporting of test quality. We compared Scondauto to (i) standard Scond analysis (Scondmanual) with manual breath selection and to (ii) pragmatic Scond analysis including all breaths (Scondall). Primary outcomes were success rate and agreement between different Scond protocols, and Scond <b>fitting</b> <b>quality</b> (linear regression R(2)). RESULTS Average Scondauto (0. 06 for CF and 0. 01 for controls) was not different from Scondmanual (0. 06 for CF and 0. 01 for controls) and showed comparable <b>fitting</b> <b>quality</b> (R(2) 0. 53 for CF and 0. 13 for controls vs. R(2) 0. 54 for CF and 0. 13 for controls). Scondall was similar in CF and controls but with inferior <b>fitting</b> <b>quality</b> compared to Scondauto and Scondmanual. CONCLUSIONS Automated Scond calculation is feasible and produces robust results comparable to the standard manual way of Scond calculation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} {{ellipsoidal}} anisotropy, first introduced in linear elasticity by Saint Venant, has reappeared {{in recent years}} in diverse applications from the phenomenological to micromechanical modeling of materials. In this concept, indicator surfaces, which represent the variation of some elastic parameters in different directions of the material, are ellipsoidal. This concept recovers different models according to the elastic parameters that have ellipsoidal indicator surfaces. An interesting feature of some models introduced by Saint Venant is the formation of analytical solutions for basic problems of linear elasticity. This paper has two main objectives. First, an accurate definition of the variety of anisotropy called ellipsoidal is provided, which corresponds to a family of materials that depends on 12 independent parameters, including varieties of orthotropic and non-orthotropic materials. An explicit nondegenerate Green function solution is established for these materials. Then, it is shown that the ellipsoidal model recovers a variety of phenomenological and theoretical models used in recent years, specifically for geomaterials and damaged or micro-cracked materials. These models can be used to approximate the elastic parameters of any anisotropic material with different <b>fitting</b> <b>qualities.</b> A method to optimize the parameters will be given...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{incidence}} of femoral fracture on hip prosthesis is increasing. Plate fixation is {{the method of}} choice when the prosthesis is stable. In fracture with proximal extension, {{the quality of the}} bone fixation is critical and, despite the development of anatomic plates, may be endangered when there are too few proximal screws. To resolve this issue, we recommend using a reversed LCP™ anatomic distal femoral Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS™) locking plate: e. g., a left distal femoral plate for femoral fracture on right-hip implant. This presents several advantages: minimally invasive surgery, the introduction of the plate being facilitated by the LISS™ ancillary; ease of locking, also thanks to the ancillary; and, above all, multiple proximal trochanteric fixation thanks to the form of this anatomic distal LISS™ plate, improving proximal bone fixation. The present technical note seeks to illustrate the interest of using a “reversed” plate, in terms of simplicity of <b>fitting</b> and <b>quality</b> of reduction and consolidation, while also specifying the associated limitations and tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 This paper details {{a method}} to compute {{absolute}} water velocity profiles from glider-based acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements based on the "shear method" developed for lowered ADCPs. The instrument is a 614 -kHz Teledyne RDI ADCP integrated {{into the body of}} a Teledyne Webb Research Slocum Glider. Shear is calculated from velocity measurements and averaged over depth intervals to create a dive-averaged shear profile. Absolute velocities are computed by vertically integrating shear profiles yielding relative velocity profiles and then referencing them to dive-average velocity measurements calculated from glider dead-reckoning and GPS. Bottom-track referenced velocities also provide absolute velocities when bottom-tracking is available, and can be applied to relative velocities, producing absolute velocity profiles through linear <b>fitting.</b> Data <b>quality</b> control is based on ADCP percent good measurements. Compass heading bias corrections are applied to the raw ADCP measurements before averaging shear profiles. Comparison between simultaneous, full-water column velocities referenced to dive-average currents and those referenced to bottom-track profiles, resulted in RMS error values of 0. 05 m s⁻¹ for both north and east components. During open ocean deployments, the glider ADCP recorded velocities concurrent and proximate to vessel ADCP measurements in waters of similar thermal characteristics.

While pre-calculated databases are commonly used to model SED data, only a few studies to date employed SA due to its unclear accuracy and convergence time for this specific problem. From a methodological point of view, different approaches lead to different <b>fitting</b> <b>quality,</b> demand on computational resources and calculation time. We compare the <b>fitting</b> <b>quality</b> and computational costs of these two approaches for the task of SED fitting to provide a guide to the practitioner to find a compromise between desired accuracy and available resources. To reduce uncertainties inherent to real datasets, we introduce a reference model resembling a typical circumstellar system with 10 free parameters. We derive the SED of the reference model with our code MC 3 D at 78 logarithmically distributed wavelengths in the range [0. 3 mu m, 1. 3 mm] and use this setup to simulate SEDs for the database and SA. Our result directly demonstrates the applicability of SA in the field of SED modeling, since the algorithm regularly finds better solutions to the optimization problem than a pre-calculated database. As both methods have advantages and shortcomings, a hybrid approach is preferable. While the database provides an approximate fit and overall probability distributions for all parameters deduced using Bayesian analysis, SA can be used to improve upon the results returned by the model grid...|$|E
