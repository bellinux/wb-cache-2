No enemy carrier was seen to diminish its speed, though Taiyo was slightly damaged in the attack. Much later, intelligence reported each of the seven explosions had been premature; the torpedoes had run true but the magnetic feature had fired them too early.|$|E
25|$|Most {{disciplinary}} councils are convened by {{a bishop}} of a ward. In such an instance, {{the council is}} composed of the bishop and his two counselors.

However, the bishop has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors.|$|E

25|$|After <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> the evidence, it {{was decided}} that the weather had caused a freeze–thaw action which had led to {{settlement}} in the ground. Another contributory factor was the construction work being carried out during poor weather, and then not being checked for settlement when the weather had improved. The settlement was sufficient to twist the tracks and reduce the contact between the rack (on the track) and the pinion (on the locomotive). The weight and speed of the train did the rest. The damage caused by the first derailment made the second almost inevitable.|$|E

500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. <b>Hearing</b> <b>all</b> these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E

500|$|After <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> the {{evidence}}, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 that Virgil, as the lawman in charge that day, had acted within {{his office and}} that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a [...] "proposition both monstrous and startling!" [...] He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys' purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them. Spicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps' actions and criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp.|$|E

[...] "Captions" [...] aim to describe to the deaf and hard of <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> significant audio content - spoken dialogue and non-speech information such as the identity of speakers and, occasionally, their manner of speaking - along with any significant music or sound effects using words or symbols.

2500|$|The same year, Raffles {{appointed}} John Crawfurd as Resident of Singapore. Crawfurd {{doubted the}} legitimacy of the judicial system set up by Raffles, and annulled proceedings in which magistrates had ordered the flogging of gamblers and the seizure of their properties. He eventually abolished the magistracy, replacing it with a Court of Requests overseen by an Assistant Resident which dealt with minor civil cases, and a Resident's Court <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> other cases which he himself presided over. Crawfurd had no authoritative guide to the applicable law, so he decided cases on [...] "general principles of English law", taking into account so far as he could the [...] "character and manners of the different classes" [...] of local inhabitants. Unfortunately, Crawfurd's courts also lacked legal foundation, and he had no legal powers over Europeans in Singapore. Serious cases involving British subjects had to be referred to Calcutta; otherwise, {{all he could do was}} to banish them from the island.|$|E

Champion believes that the owners are doing a disservice to the real history, the people who should be honoured [...] "by remembering who they really were and what they actually did". He understands why people report strange occurrences, the ship still creaks and groans, and people's imaginations can get away from them such that they start seeing and <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> kinds of things, attributing them to the paranormal which they have been primed for. [...] "Ghost stories are fine", concludes Champion [...] "when presented as such. The confusion of science and history with fiction ... gets us further away from the ability to relish in and truly explore our own recent history." ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{who wish}} to be baptized in the INC must first submit to a formal process taking at least six months. Once someone officially {{registers}} with their local congregation, the person is given the status of being a Bible student (Tagalog: dinudoktrinahan) and taught the twenty-five lessons concerning fundamental teachings and its beginnings in the Philippines. These lessons are contained in the doctrine manual written by Eraño G. Manalo entitled [...] "Fundamental Beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo". This book is given to ministers, evangelical workers, and ministerial students of the INC. Each lesson is usually thirty minutes to one hour in length. After <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> the lessons, the students enters a probationary period (Tagalog: sinusubok) during which they are obliged to attend fifteen once-a-week group prayer meetings, where they are taught to pray and are guided in their adjustment to the INC lifestyle. When the sixth month comes, {{students who have been}} active in attending the twice-a-week worship services and whose lifestyles are in accordance with INC doctrines are screened before being baptized. During the screening, they are asked questions about the teachings of the church.|$|E
2500|$|Murphy's accomplishments are all {{the more}} {{remarkable}} as he was deaf. He was known as [...] "Silent Mike" [...] due to his affliction, and contemporary reports state that, though he was deaf, the affliction was not so severe as to prevent him from <b>hearing</b> <b>all</b> remarks. One report in 1905 noted: [...] "It was characteristic of Murphy to encourage the belief that he was very deaf and thus break down the caution of the lads who prided themselves on their ability to outwit the veteran." [...] In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been [...] "rather deaf" [...] for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him [...] "has to shout {{at the top of his}} lungs." [...] Murphy joked at the time, [...] "I'm not much of a one to tell secrets to." [...] When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson–James Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems. After she finished, Murphy told her, [...] "Madame, you have come to the right person. Your secrets are safe. I have not heard a word you said." ...|$|E
