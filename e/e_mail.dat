Information is transmitted, e.g., by <b>e</b> <b>mail,</b> to an agent, e.g., a parent. The transmitted information is information that may be used to authorize the agent to control the virtual environment of the user. The virtual environment of the user is controlled by setting a level of interaction at which the user is permitted to interact with others.

One {{would expect that}} professionals for whom the group identity as ‘special professional’ is both important and perceived as being under threat, would only be supportive of inclusion {{if it could be}} orchestrated in a way which fosters that identity. This paper provides a review of the research literature concerning social group identification and perceived threat with particular reference to out-group derogation, perception of group structure and in-group affirming behaviour. This review provides the context for findings from a scale about social identity (devised for this research) concerning an <b>e</b> <b>mail</b> group oriented to professionals working with children with special needs (N= 105). The survey identified three social identity factors (perceived typicality, public reference to the group and identification with prototypical group members).
