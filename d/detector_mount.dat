40|$|The Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a {{near-infrared}} wide-band high-resolution spectrograph jointly {{developed by}} the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and the University of Texas at Austin. IGRINS employs three HAWAII- 2 RG Focal Plane Array (H 2 RG FPA) detectors. We present the design and fabrication of the <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> for the H 2 RG detector. The <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> consists of a detector housing, an ASIC housing, a Field Flattener Lens (FFL) mount, and a support base frame. The detector and the ASIC housing should be kept at 65 K and the support base frame at 130 K. Therefore they are thermally isolated by the support made of GFRP material. The <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> is designed so that it has features of fine adjusting {{the position of the}} detector surface in the optical axis and of fine adjusting yaw and pitch angles in order to utilize as an optical system alignment compensator. We optimized the structural stability and thermal characteristics of the mount design using computer-aided 3 D modeling and finite element analysis. Based on the structural and thermal analysis, the designed <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> meets an optical stability tolerance and system thermal requirements. Actual <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> fabricated based on the design has been installed into the IGRINS cryostat and successfully passed a vacuum test and a cold test...|$|E

A very fast beam (f/ 1) with a mosaic of two MITLL CCID- 34 detectors placed only 1 mm behind the field flattener which also serves as the dewar window, have called for innovative engineering solutions.

40|$|The red {{channel of}} the Palomar Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the 200 -inch Hale Telescope has been {{upgraded}} {{with a new}} deep-depletion CCD from LBNL. Its redder response produced a significant increase of the throughput above 550 nm, and its longer dimension more than doubled the spectral coverage. A special Dewar was designed to accommodate a <b>detector</b> <b>mount</b> which includes features to minimize CCD motion due to thermal cycling, {{in spite of the}} very simple "picture frame" packaging of the CCD. The new Dewar also includes some novel features to improve the liquid nitrogen hold time while staying within the size envelope allowed in the Cassegrain cage.

40|$|The X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) to {{be flown}} on the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) {{consists}} of an array of microcalorimeters and an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR). The ADR provides an operating temperature of 0. 065 to 0. 100 K. To support extensive development testing of the ADR and the detector array, a test dewar has been designed and built that surpasses specification requirements. Pumping on the liquid helium bath with a 47 l/s pump, we have achieved temperatures lower than 1. 5 K with a hold time in excess of 72 hrs. The dewar can be operated without liquid nitrogen with a hold time of 36 hrs. This feature was incorporated in the design because boiling nitrogen may introduce microphonic noise to the detectors. To further reduce the susceptibility to microphonic vibration a unique suspension system utilizing Kevlar fibers was devised which provides both translational and rotational rigidity to the <b>detector</b> <b>mount.</b> Finally, the dewar is very manageable and may be rotated by only one person...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the features and functionality of the UCam (UKATC Universal Camera Control and Data Acquisition) detector control {{system with a}} particular emphasis on development and testing of two 4 K x 4 K CCD camera systems built recently at UKATC and delivered {{to a group of}} telescopes in India. These two camera systems use two variants of an e 2 v CCD 203 device; a 4 kx 4 k standard back-thinned device and a deep depleted silicon device. Apart from the expected differences with the spectral response of these devices, other performance differences have been observed between the two systems such as conversion gain non-linearity, electrical crosstalk between outputs, fringing etc. which are thought {{to be related to the}} silicon thickness. Both these detectors show charge trapping during device power on or when saturated. The effects of this charge trapping and a solution implemented to minimise it will be presented.
