5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles paid no {{attention}} to the problems she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of <b>Ghent</b> between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in <b>Ghent</b> had been subdued.|$|E

Murdaw then turns into the King of Somnia, confused and unaware of what happened. The king reveals that the original world {{is in fact the}} Dream World and the Phantom World is the Real World. Upon traveling back to the Real World, the King of Somnia thanks the party for defeating Murdaw in his dreams, but that the real Murdaw lives and that the party must travel to <b>Ghent</b> to retrieve a boat to get to Murdaw's lair. In <b>Ghent,</b> Nevan, a healer, joins the party and allows them to use the <b>Ghent</b> Clan's ship. During the fight with the real Murdaw, the Hero gets is again sent back to Weaver's Peak. However, with the Mirror of Ra, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw.|$|E

5|$|Crillon served again under d'Harcourt in 1744 {{when the}} latter {{commanded}} the Army of the Moselle during its campaigns along the Rhine. He {{participated in the}} siege of Fribourg and spent the winter in Swabia {{under the command of}} Marshal Coigny as colonel of an infantry regiment. In May 1745, he fought in the major Battle of Fontenoy near Tournai in modern-day Belgium and captured nearly 50 pieces of artillery from the Dutch, British, and Hanoverian alliance opposing the French. The following month he was appointed brigadier. On 10 July, he fought in what the French termed the battle of the Mésle at Dendermonde near <b>Ghent,</b> leading 8,000 men to victory against a British, Austrian and Dutch force. He then took part in the captures of <b>Ghent,</b> Ostend and Nieuwpoort.|$|E
5|$|Helen became pregnant; Simpson's {{apartment}} in Paris was now unsuitable {{and a larger}} home in France was not in their means. In October, with help from his friend, Albert Beurick, they moved into a small cottage in <b>Ghent.</b> Low on funds, Simpson earned money in one-day track races in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} against Belgium in <b>Ghent,</b> Murray beat Ruben Bemelmans and {{combined}} with brother Jamie {{to win the}} doubles rubber before defeating David Goffin to win the Davis Cup for Great Britain, 79 years after the national team's last win.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 <b>Ghent</b> Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from <b>Ghent,</b> and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of bookwheels built in the 17th and 18th centuries, 14 are extant: in <b>Ghent,</b> Hamburg, Klosterneuburg, Krakau, Lambach, Leiden, Naples (2), Paris, Prague (2), Puebla City, Wernigerode and in the Wolfenbüttel.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of <b>Ghent,</b> ending {{hostilities}} {{between the}} United States and Britain, was signed on 24December 1814. However, the United States did not ratify the treaty until 18February 1815. The war carried {{on in the}} interim.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Opera {{was founded}} in Norfolk in 1974. Its artistic {{director}} since its inception has been Peter Mark, who conducted his 100th opera production for the VOA in 2008. Though performances are staged statewide, the company's principal venue is the Harrison Opera House in the <b>Ghent</b> district.|$|E
5|$|Adelard of <b>Ghent,</b> Epistola Adelardi ad Elfegum Archiepiscopum de Vita Sancti Dunstani, Adelard's {{letter to}} Archbishop Ælfheah of Canterbury (1005–1012) on the Life of St Dunstan, ed. W. Stubbs, Memorials of St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury. Rolls Series 63. London, 1874. 53–68. Also {{in the new}} edition and {{translation}} by Michael Lapidge and Michael Winterbottom, The Early Lives of St Dunstan, Oxford University Press, 2012.|$|E
5|$|After Murdac's {{death in}} 1153, Osbert {{was opposed to}} William's return as archbishop, but was {{unsuccessful}} in his attempts to prevent William's reappointment. William died a week after his return to York, however, and Osbert, along with Robert of <b>Ghent,</b> the Dean of York, secured the quick election of the new archbishop, Roger de Pont L'Évêque.|$|E
5|$|After Philmont, NY217 {{progresses}} its way northeastward, {{with the}} highway winding {{its way through}} a mixture of dense woods and open fields. Shortly after crossing into the town of <b>Ghent,</b> the route turns eastward and the woods around the highway begin to cease. Here, NY217 ends at the Taconic State Parkway {{by way of a}} parclo interchange.|$|E
5|$|After the Tour Simpson rode criteriums {{before the}} road {{world championships in}} Salò, Italy, where he retired after missing a large breakaway. He began riding six-day track races into his winter break. In December he made an {{appearance}} at the Champions' Concert cycling awards held at Royal Albert Hall in London. Separately, he won the British Cycling Federation's Personality of the Year. Simpson and Helen were expecting their second child and upgraded to a larger house in Sint-Amandsberg, a sub-municipality of <b>Ghent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite this outcome, the Treaty of <b>Ghent</b> of 1815 {{forced the}} British {{to return the}} island and {{surrounding}} mainland to the U.S. The United States reoccupied Fort Mackinac, and renamed Fort George as Fort Holmes, after Major Holmes. Fort Mackinac remained {{under the control of}} the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the American Civil War. The fort was used as a prison for three Confederate States of America sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Gervase held {{lands in}} London {{inherited}} from his father-in-law, lands in Kent from his father, and lands in Gamlingay which he got through a mortgage. He also acquired other lands in Essex and Surrey. He also gave lands at Greenwich and East Lewisham to St. Peter's Abbey in <b>Ghent</b> and other lands to Holy Trinity Priory at Aldgate.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of <b>Ghent</b> {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing {{and turned it into a}} routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, she {{attended}} the annual Navy Days event at Portsmouth and Portland Harbour, receiving {{a total of}} 17,300visitors. In October of the same year, she ventured abroad {{for the first time}} on a visit to <b>Ghent,</b> Belgium. She followed this with a fortnight of Sea Dart exercises on a range off Aberporth, in South Wales. Whilst in the region, the destroyer attended celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of Cardiff's city status.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{battles that}} {{occurred}} in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. Most of the Native Americans remained passive throughout the war, but there were many incidents between settlers and the tribes, leading to the deaths of hundreds in the territory. The Treaty of <b>Ghent,</b> signed in 1814, ended the War and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|Polyptychs were {{produced}} by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and {{a greater number of}} possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels. The <b>Ghent</b> Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Britain and the United States {{escalated}} {{again during}} the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of <b>Ghent,</b> ensuring Canada's future would be separate {{from that of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; {{the cream}} of the Allied forces, which {{included}} the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either reinforcing the Belgians in the east of the country, at the Meuse–Albert Canal line, and holding the Scheldt Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting <b>Ghent</b> and Antwerp, seemed to be the soundest defensive strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan records {{his death}} as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert's successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first securely attested as dean on 6 May 1158, {{and the last}} secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, which suggests that Robert of <b>Ghent</b> died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} 1815 {{was to have}} seen a British {{offensive}} in the south, with the Royal Marine Battalions to advance westward into Georgia, {{to be joined by}} Nicolls and his forces from the Gulf Coast. These plans were overtaken by events, as peace was declared following the conclusion of the Treaty of <b>Ghent.</b> With the offensive cancelled, Nicolls and his men returned to Prospect Bluff. On 15 March 1815, a U.S. Army aide-de-camp named Walter Bourke communicated to Major General Thomas Pinckney that conditions were difficult on the Georgia frontier despite efforts to reinforce American defences, and to negotiate the return of slaves who had joined the Corps of Colonial Marines under the command of Rear Admiral George Cockburn still at Cumberland Island. Cockburn was not inclined to voluntarily hand over British military personnel who risked being returned to slavery by the Americans, and professed difficulty in communicating news of the Treaty of <b>Ghent</b> to Nicolls.|$|E
5|$|Thored {{may be the}} Thored {{who appears}} {{for the first time}} in charter {{attestations}} during the reign of King Edgar (95975), his earliest possible appearance being in 964, witnessing a grant of land in Kent by King Edgar to St Peter's, <b>Ghent.</b> This is uncertain because the authenticity of this particular charter is unclear. A charter issued by Edgar in 966, granting land in Oxfordshire to a woman named Ælfgifu, has an illegible ealdorman witness signature beginning with Þ, which may be Thored.|$|E
5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. <b>Ghent,</b> writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in <b>Ghent</b> in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E
5|$|At the 2005 National Championships, Sacramone won the {{individual}} titles on floor and vault, scoring a 9.9 on floor, and placed {{third on the}} balance beam and fourth in the all-around. She {{was named to the}} American team, along with Nastia Liukin and Chellsie Memmel, for the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, where she won a gold medal on floor and placed third on vault. She also defended her World Cup vault title, winning the event at both the World Cup qualifier in <b>Ghent,</b> Belgium, and the finals in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from <b>Ghent</b> and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} represented Belgium at youth level, Mertens {{received his}} first senior call-up by national team coach Georges Leekens on 1 October 2010 for the nation's UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Kazakhstan and Austria. Though he never featured in either match, Mertens {{would make his}} debut on 9 February the following year in a friendly match against Finland in <b>Ghent.</b> He scored his first goal for Belgium on 15 August 2012 in the 125th Derby der Lage Landen. Mertens, having come on as substitute for Nacer Chadli, scored once and assisted twice, to help Belgium overcome a 2–1 deficit versus the Netherlands and win 4–2.|$|E
5|$|In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's {{head with}} him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his status as an archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering {{the writing of the}} second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard of <b>Ghent</b> composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.|$|E
5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the circumstances that allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of <b>Ghent</b> ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E
