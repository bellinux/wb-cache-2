2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of aluminium sulphate. When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

Tubs could be lifted more easily than larger boats and tub boat lifts and inclined planes were developed as an alternative to canal locks, particularly in or near a colliery or similar industrial works. At a lift the train could easily be divided, the boats lifted individually, and the train reassembled afterwards. Sometimes the boats used snug-fitting non-waterproof <b>inner</b> <b>containers</b> which could be more easily lifted out.

50|$|Originally {{designed}} to be greater than, or equal to, the construction and performance specifics of an <b>inner</b> <b>container,</b> the Performance Oriented Packaging Standards (POPS) of the US Department of Transportation requirement was that the Salvage Drum {{be at least a}} 'Z' (Packing Group III) solids container. Convinced that this was not an acceptable test for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T) became the UN recommended salvage packaging for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an 85 US gallon capacity steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for Packing Group II and be dropped 1.2 meters (4 feet) on its most critical orientation, and not leak. In addition, the drum must successfully pass a 30 kPa Leakproofness Test. Both tests are very severe for an open-head steel container. This testing illustrates the extreme capabilities of the 'T' Salvage Drum when used for the safe recovery of hazardous materials in transportation.|$|E

50|$|When {{a liquid}} presses against a surface, {{there is a}} net force that is {{perpendicular}} to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point. This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction {{at right angles to}} the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> surface will increase with increasing depth - that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is , where h is the depth below the free surface. Interestingly, this is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance h.|$|E
5000|$|The {{isolation}} of Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is credited to Rolf Michel and Barbel Hauroder-Philippczyk in Berlin in 1994. Using a nasal swab from volunteers, {{they were able}} to isolate coccoid-shaped bacteria that were present among other naturally-produced organisms. Although at least ten subsequent attempts at reisolation were tried, P. acanthamoebae was not isolated again until 1997 when the researchers Rudolf Amann, Nina Springer, and Wolfgang Ludwig isolated it with a strain of Acanthamoeba species. This sample was transferred to a non-nutrient agar plate and the parasitized trophozoite of the Acanthamoeba species multiplied. A trophozoite is an active stage in the Acanthamoeba species life cycle in which the protozoan grows and feeds. [...] The researchers were able to isolate the infected trophozoites by this method only once, as subsequent tries were unsuccessful. The researchers then took small aliquots of the organism and filtered it to ensure the sample was pure. After running these samples through a centrifuge, a machine with a rapid rotating <b>inner</b> <b>container,</b> the samples were used to directly amplify the 16S rRNA gene to form a nearly full-length rRNA sequence by Polymerase Chain Reaction. The ribosomal DNA was sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit of Pharmacia.

40|$|The first {{nondestructive}} examination (NDE) of 3013 -type containers {{as part of}} the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Integrated Surveillance Program (ISP) {{was performed}} in February, 2005. Since that date 280 NDE surveillances on 255 containers have been conducted. These containers were packaged with plutonium-bearing materials at multiple DOE sites. The NDE surveillances were conducted at Hanford, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Savannah River Site (SRS). These NDEs consisted of visual inspection, mass verification, radiological surveys, prompt gamma analysis, and radiography. The primary purpose of performing NDE surveillances is to determine if there has been a significant pressure buildup inside the <b>inner</b> 3013 <b>container.</b> This is done by measuring the lid deflection of the <b>inner</b> 3013 <b>container</b> using radiography images. These lid deflection measurements are converted to pressure measurements to determine if a container has a pressure of a 100 psig or greater. Making this determination is required by Surveillance and Monitoring Plan (S&MP). All 3013 containers are designed to withstand at least 699 psig as specified by DOE-STD- 3013. To date, all containers evaluated have pressures under 50 psig. In addition, the radiography is useful in evaluating the contents of the 3013 container as well as determining the condition of the walls of the <b>inner</b> 3013 <b>container</b> and the convenience containers. The radiography has shown no signs of degradation of any container, but has revealed two packaging anomalies. Quantitative pressure measurements based on lid deflections, which give more information than the 'less than or greater than 100 psig' (pass/fail) data are also available for many containers. Statistical analyses of the pass/fail data combined with analysis of the quantitative data show that it is extremely unlikely that any container in the population of 3013 containers considered in this study (e. g., containers packaged according to the DOE-STD- 3013 by 2006) would exceed a pressure of 100 psig. At this time, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and LLNL continue to package containers. Future NDE surveillances will address containers packaged after 2006 for both sites as well as containers requested by the Materials Identification Surveillance (MIS) working group based on knowledge gained from shelf-life study and surveillance results...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) standard, DOE-STD- 3013 - 2000, {{establishes}} {{criteria for}} stabilizing, packaging, {{and long term}} safe storage of plutonium-bearing materials at DOE facilities.

For oxide material a maximum of 5 kg of material is packaged in a nested set of two individually welded containers and the requirements include material stabilization at 950 C, 0. 5 weight percent moisture content or less, and less than nineteen watts of power per sealed container. The welded containers ensure that any gas generated due to radiolysis will be retained within the container. Although the 3013 package provides for a robust storage system, its long-term safety performance has not been demonstrated.

40|$|Destructive {{evaluation}} (DE) of 3013 containers is {{one part}} of the U. S. Department of Energy Integrated Surveillance Program. During standard DE of 3013 containers, visual examinations for pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) are performed on the accessible surfaces of the outer, inner, and convenience containers, which make up the 3013 container. As a result of 3013 DE additional analysis, the area near the <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> closure weld has been identified as being a region of increased corrosion susceptibility, which may provide a pathway for corrosive gases to the outer container. This area has a higher residual stress, an altered microstructure, and less corrosion resistant weld oxides {{as a result of the}} welding process as well as a lower temperature than other areas of the container, which may increase the absorption of moisture on the surface. The deposition of moisture in this stressed region could lead to pitting and stress corrosion cracking. During FY 2013, the <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> closure weld area was more closely evaluated on several archived samples from DE containers. These containers included FY 09 DE 2, FY 12 DE 4, FY 12 DE 6 and FY 12 DE 7 and the Hanford High Moisture Container.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has {{published}} a standard that specifies the criteria for preparation and packaging of plutonium metals and oxides for safe long-term storage (DOE-STD- 3013 - 96). This standard is followed for the packaging of materials resulting from the disassembly of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Advanced Retirement and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project. Declassified plutonium metal or oxide material from the ARES project is packaged into doubly contained and welded type 304 L stainless steel containers that comply with the DOE standard. The 3013 - 96 standard describes requirements for maximum contamination limits on the outer surface of the sealed <b>inner</b> <b>container.</b> These limits are 500 dpm per 100 cm 2 for direct measurements and 20 dpm per 100 cm 2 for removable contamination. For containers filled, welded, and handled inside a highly contaminated glovebox line, these limits are difficult to obtain. Simple handling within the line is demonstrated to contaminate surfaces from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 dpm alpha per 100 cm 2. To routinely achieve contamination levels below the maximum contamination levels specified by the 3013 - 96 standard within a processing operation, a decontamination step must be included. In the ARIES line, this decontamination step is an electrolytic process that produces a controlled uniform etch of the container surfaces. Decontamination of the 3013 - 96 compliant ARIES <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> is well demonstrated. Within 30 to 50 minutes electrolysis time, tixed contamination is reduced to hundreds of dpm generally occurring only at electrode contact points and welds. Removable contamination is routinely brought to non-detectable levels. The total process time for the cycle (includes electrolysis, rinse, and dry stages) is {{on the order of}} 1. 5 to 2 hours per container. The ARIES <b>inner</b> <b>container</b> decontamination system highly automated and consists of a plumbing loop, electronic controls and process monitors, and a decontamination chamber or "fixture". The tixture is situated like an air lock between a contaminated and an uncontaminated section of a processing glovebox.

This analysis does five things: (1) Estimates the H{sub 2 } generation from the reaction of uranium metal with water; (2) Estimates the H{sub 2 } generation from radiolysis (using Radcalc 4. 1); (3) Combines both H{sub 2 } generation amounts, from Items 1 and 2, and determines the percent concentration of H{sub 2 } in the interior of an SWB with two Super Pigs, and the interior of a 55 -gallon drum with two Piglets; (4) From the combined gas generation rate, shows that the pressure at internal layers is minimal; and (5) Calculates the maximum thermal load of the package, both from radioactive decay of the source and daughter products as calculated/reported by Radcalc 4. 1, and from the exothermic reaction of uranium metal with water...|$|R
