40|$|ObjectiveTo {{develop a}} novel method of spinal pedical stereotaxy by reverse {{engineering}} and rapid prototyping techniques, and to validate its accuracy by experimental and clinical studies. MethodsA 3 D reconstruction {{model for the}} desired lumbar vertebra was generated by using the Mimics 10. 11 software, and the optimal screw size and orientation were determined using the reverse engineering software. Afterwards, a <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> was created by reverse engineering principle, whose surface was the antitemplate of the vertebral surface. The <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> and its corresponding vertebra were manufactured using the rapid prototyping technique. ResultsThe accuracy of the <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> was confirmed by drilling screw trajectory into the vertebral biomodel preoperatively. This method also showed its ability to customize the placement and size of each screw based on the unique morphology of the lumbar vertebra. The <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> fits the postural surface of the vertebra {{very well in the}} cadaver experiment. Postoperative CT scans for controlling the pedicle bore showed that the personalized template had a high precision in cadaver experiment and clinical application. No misplacement occurred by using the personalized template. During surgery, no additional computer assistance was needed. ConclusionsThe authors have developed a novel <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> for lumbar pedicle screw placement with good applicability and high accuracy. The potential use of drill templates to place lumbar pedicle screws is promising. Our methodology appears to provide an accurate technique and trajectory for pedicle screw placement in the lumbar spine...|$|E
40|$|Background: With the {{properties}} of three-column fixation and anterior-approach-only procedure, anterior transpedicular screw (ATPS) is ideal for severe multilevel traumatic cervical instabilities. However, the accurate insertion of ATPS remains challenging. Here we constructed a patient-specific biocompatible <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> and evaluated its accuracy in assisting ATPS insertion. Methods: After ethical approval, 24 formalin-preserved cervical vertebrae (C 2 –C 7) were CT scanned. 3 D reconstruction models of cervical vertebra were obtained with 2 -mm-diameter virtual pin tracts at the central pedicles. The 3 D models were used for rapid prototyping (RP) printing. A 2 -mm-diameter Kirschner wire was then inserted into the pin tract of the RP model before polymethylmethacrylate was used to construct the patient-specific biocompatible <b>drill</b> <b>template.</b> After removal of the anterior soft tissue, a 2 -mm-diameter Kirschner wire was inserted into the cervical pedicle {{with the assistance of}} <b>drill</b> <b>template.</b> Cadaveric cervical spines with pin tracts were subsequently scanned using the same CT scanner. A 3 D reconstruction was performed of the scanned spines to get 3 D models of the vertebrae containing the actual pin tracts. The deviations were calculated between 3 D models with virtual and actual pin tracts at the middle point of the cervical pedicle. 3 D models of 3. 5 mm-diameter screws were used in simulated insertion to grade the screw positions. Findings: The patient-specific biocompatible <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> was constructed to assist ATPS insertion successfully. There wer...|$|E
40|$|Study Design: Prospective trial. Objective: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a novel, patient-specific navigational template for cervical pedicle placement. Summary of Background Data: Owing {{to the narrow}} bony anatomy and the proximity to the vertebral artery and the spinal cord, cervical instrumentation procedures demand {{the need for a}} precise technique for screw placement. PATIENT. : Specific <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> with preplanned trajectory has been thought as a promising solution for cervical pedicle screw placement. Methods: Patients with cervical spinal pathology (n = 25) requiring instrumentation were recruited. Volumetric CT scan was performed on each desired cervical vertebra and a 3 -dimensional reconstruction model was generated from the scan data. Using reverse engineering technique, the optimal screw size and orientation were determined and a <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> was designed with a surface that is the inverse of the posterior vertebral surface. The <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> and its corresponding vertebra were manufactured using rapid prototyping technique and tested for violations. The navigational template was sterilized and used intraoperatively to assist with the placement of cervical screws. In total, 88 screws were inserted into levels C 2 -C 7 with 2 to 6 screw in each patient. After surgery, the positions of the pedicle screws were evaluated using CT scan and graded for validation. Results: This method showed its ability to customize the placement and the size of each screw based on the unique morphology of the cervical vertebra. In all the cases, it was relatively very easy to manually place the <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> on the lamina of the vertebral body during the surgery. The required time between fixation of the template to the lamina and insertion of the pedicle screws was about 80 seconds. Of the 88 screws, 71 screws had no deviation and 14 screws had deviation < 2 mm, 1 screw had a deviation between 2 to 4 mm and there were no misplacements. Fluoroscopy was used only once for every patient after the insertion of all the pedicle screws. Conclusion: The authors have developed a novel patient-specific navigational template for cervical pedicle screw placement with good applicability and high accuracy. This method significantly reduces the operation time and radiation exposure for the members of the surgical team. The potential use of such a navigational template to insert cervical pedicle screws is promising. This technique has been clinically validated to provide an accurate trajectory for pedicle screw placement in the cervical spine. © 2009, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{bilateral}} sagittal osteotomy (BSSO) is {{a widely}} used surgical technique within orthognatic surgery. The specific osteotomy design may vary from clinic to clinic.

In addition, standardisation in, for example, research may be desirable. Pre-operative planning using a <b>drilling</b> <b>template</b> in order to position the planned individual saw cuts during BSSO can be of value. To achieve this goal, a pre-operative 3 D printed biocompatible <b>drilling</b> <b>template</b> was manufactured for 1 patient on the basis of pre-operative planning.

40|$|A new {{template}} {{technique has}} been developed for implanting hyperthermia catheters {{in the treatment of}} brain tumors. The technique utilizes an imaging template and a <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> which can be rigidly secured to the head with three skull screws. The anatomic and vascular information needed for hyperthermia treatment planning may be assessed with three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and angiography acquisitions which use a surface coil. In the companioning treatment planning system the catheter positions and lengths and the electrodes in the catheter can be interactively manipulated relative to the anatomy and vasculature. The visualization of the blood vessels relative to the template allows the minimization of the risk on intracranial hemorrhages. This template technique is useful for any brain tumor implants, especially when a large number of catheters are involved. A phantom test has shown that this procedure has an accuracy in the order of 1 mm provided that the MR-related geometry distortions are minimize...|$|E
40|$|The present {{method of}} C 2 laminar screw {{placement}} relies on anatomical landmarks for screw placement. Placement of C 2 laminar screws using <b>drill</b> <b>template</b> {{has not been}} described in the literature. The authors reported on their experience with placement of C 2 laminar screws using a novel computer-assisted drill guide template in nine patients undergoing posterior occipito-cervical fusion. CT scan of C 2 vertebrae was performed. 3 D model of C 2 vertebrae was reconstructed by software MIMICS 10. 01. The 3 D vertebral model was then exported in STL format, and opened in a workstation running software UG imageware 12. 0 for determining the optimal laminar screw size and orientation. A virtual navigational template was established according to the laminar anatomic trait. The physical vertebrae and navigational template were manufactured using rapid prototyping. The navigational template was sterilized and used intraoperative to assist the placement of laminar screw. Overall, 19 C 2 laminar screws were placed and the accuracy of screw placement was confirmed with postoperative X-ray and CT scanning. There were not complications of related screws insertion. Average follow-up was 9  months (range 4 – 13  months), 77. 8 % of the patients exhibited improvement in their myelopathic symptoms; in 22. 2 % the symptoms were unchanged. Postoperative computed tomographic (CT) scanning was available for allowing the evaluation of placement of thirteen C 2 laminar screws, {{all of which were}} in good position with no spinal canal violation. This study shows a patient-specific template technique that is easy to use, can simplify the surgical act and generates highly accurate C 2 laminar screw placement. Advantages of this technology over traditional techniques include planning of the screw trajectory is done completely in the presurgical period as well as the ability to size the screw to the patient’s anatomy...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pedicle screw {{placement}} using {{free hand}} technique has {{high incidence of}} pedicle perforation. The said risk can be reduced with intra-operative fluoroscopy or navigation, which have some disadvantages. A promising principle for solving most of the issues is the rapid prototyping technology. By this technique {{it is possible to}} manufacture patient specific <b>drill</b> guide <b>templates</b> that enable optimal pedicle screw placement. In the last decade, many studies have featured relatively successful implantations of pedicle screws through the use of <b>drill</b> guide <b>templates,</b> though mostly on cadavers. We performed a similar clinical study involving the manufacture of templates for the lumbar and sacral regions that enable simultaneous multiple- level screw implanting. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed in 15 patients. In the lumbar and sacral spine 30 screws were implanted using <b>drill</b> guide <b>template</b> and 36 screws using free hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision. Preoperative CT-scans were taken for <b>drill</b> guide <b>template</b> design and manufacture using selective laser sintering method. According to postoperative CTscan analysis, pedicle perforation incidence was estimated. Results: The incidence of cortex perforation was significantly reduced in the <b>drill</b> guide <b>template</b> group. Conclusions: <b>Drill</b> guide <b>templates</b> {{have turned out to be}} a reliable solution that importantly reduces pedicle perforation incidence and complications related to it. However, there are shortcomings: a relatively lengthy manufacturing process, possible manufacturing faults and incorrect positioning during the operation. Owing to mentioned disadvantages, templates have not replaced free hand and navigation technique yet, but could represent a useful tool in some selected cases...|$|R

40|$|Many {{diseases}} of the spine require surgical treatments that are currently performed based {{on the experience of}} the surgeon. For pedicle arthrodesis surgery, two critical factors must be addressed: Screws must be applied correctly and exposure to harmful radiation must be avoided. The incorrect positioning of the screws may cause operating failures that lead to subsequent reoperations, an increase in the overall duration of surgery and, therefore, more harmful, real-time X-ray checks. In this paper, the authors solve these problems by developing a method to realize a customized surgical template that acts as a <b>drilling</b> <b>template.</b> The template has two cylindrical guides that follow a correct trajectory previously calculated by means of an automatic algorithm generated {{on the basis of a}} vertebra CAD model for a specific patient. The surgeon sets the <b>template</b> (<b>drilling</b> guides) on the patient’s vertebra and safely applies the screws. Three surgical interventions for spinal stabilization have been performed using the template. These have had excellent results with regard to the accuracy of the screw positioning, reduction of the overall duration of the intervention, and reduction of the number of times the patient was exposed to X-rays...|$|R

30|$|A {{variety of}} factors (i.e. technical, product, mechanical, {{procedure}} and environmental factors) can affect the accuracy of implant placement [7]. Commonly, implant placement accuracy is higher by experienced surgeons [8], but patient-related factors are often less easy to control. Some {{progress has been made}} to control patient factors by using tooth-supported <b>drilling</b> <b>templates,</b> as demonstrated here; they enable a more precise transfer of the virtual implant planning to the surgical site than mucosa- or bone-supported templates [6, 9]. However, there is still a need to identify appropriate evaluation techniques and mechanisms capable of optimizing transfer precision and eliminating errors of three-dimensional planning and guiding systems for the partially dentate jaw [10]. Planning is complex, and high transfer precision is not always easy to accomplish, particularly in oligodontia cases with a large number of missing teeth. With the use of the described method, pre-operative implant planning is possible and placement is more predictable.|$|R
40|$|Many {{clinical}} situations ask for {{the simultaneous}} visualization of anatomical surfaces and synthetic meshes. Common examples include hip replacement surgery, intra-operative visualization of surgical instruments or probes, visualization of planning information, or implant surgery. To be useful for treatment planning and surgery, the combined visualization of anatomical information with mesh-surfaces should meet some requirements. First, anatomical information should be {{as accurate as possible}} to give the clinician a realistic view of the different structures. Second, the clinician should be able to interactively position the synthetic mesh, for example, an implant or surgical instrument, judge the positions with respect to the anatomy, and make adjustments where necessary. We developed a technique that meets these requirements and displays anatomical surfaces together with synthetic meshes. The usefulness of this technique will be demonstrated by applying it to dental implant surgery.

40|$|Purpose. To preliminarily {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and accuracy of}} using rapid prototyping <b>drill</b> <b>templates</b> (RPDTs) for C 1 lateral mass screw (C 1 -LMS) and C 2 pedicle screw (C 2 -PS) placement. Methods. 23 formalin-fixed craniocervical cadaver specimens were randomly divided into two groups. In the conventional method group, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to assist the screw placement. In the RPDT navigation group, specific RPDTs were constructed for each specimen and were used intraoperatively for screw placement navigation. The screw position, the operating time, and the fluoroscopy time for each screw placement were compared between the 2 groups. Results. Compared with the conventional method, the RPDT technique significantly increased the placement accuracy of the C 2 -PS (p 0. 05). Moreover, the RPDT technique significantly decreased the operating and fluoroscopy times. Conclusion. Using RPDTs significantly increases the accuracy of C 1 -LMS and C 2 -PS placement while decreasing the screw placement time and the radiation exposure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The transoral atlantoaxial {{reduction}} plate system treats irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation from transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate-I to transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate-III. However, {{this system}} has demonstrated {{problems associated with}} screw loosening, atlantoaxial fixation and concealed or manifest neurovascular injuries. This study sought to design a set of individualized templates to improve the accuracy of anterior C 2 screw placement in the transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate-IV procedure. METHODS: A set of individualized templates was designed according to thin-slice computed tomography data obtained from 10 human cadavers. The templates contained cubic modules and drill guides to facilitate transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate positioning and anterior C 2 screw placement. We performed 2 stages of cadaveric experiments with 2 cadavers in stage one and 8 in stage two. Finally, guided C 2 screw placement was evaluated by reading postoperative computed tomography images and comparing the planned and inserted screw trajectories. RESULTS: There were two cortical breaching screws in stage one and three in stage two, but only the cortical breaching screws in stage one were ranked critical. In stage two, the planned entry points and the transverse angles of the anterior C 2 screws could be simulated, whereas the declination angles could not be simulated due to intraoperative blockage of the drill bit and screwdriver by the upper teeth. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to use individualized templates to guide transoral C 2 screw placement. Thus, these <b>drill</b> <b>templates</b> combined with transoral atlantoaxial reduction plate-IV, may improve the accuracy of transoral C 2 screw placement and reduce related neurovascular complications...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{reliability}} of the planning software of an image-guided implant placement system based on a mechanical device coupled with a template stabilized on soft tissue during surgery. Materials and Methods: Thirty consecutive partially or completely edentu-lous patients were treated with the image-guided system. For each patient, a study prosthesis was fab-ricated and duplicated in acrylic resin and served as a scanning template. Axial images were obtained from a computerized tomographic scan and transferred to planning software that provides real 3 -dimensional information to plan implant position. Once the final position of the implant was defined, preoperative data such as the size of implants and anatomic complications were recorded using the planning software. The scanning <b>template</b> was then <b>drilled</b> in that exact position by a drilling machine. During surgery, the <b>drilled</b> <b>template</b> was used as a drill guide. After implant placement, intraoperative data were recorded and statistically compared with the preoperative data using the Kendall correlation coefficient for qualitative data and the Kappa concordance coefficient for quantitative data. Results: Agreement between the preoperative and intraoperative data was high for both implant size and anatomic complications. The Kendall correlation coefficient was 0. 8 for the diameter and 0. 82 for the length. The Kappa concordance coefficient was 0. 87 for both dehiscence and bone graft, 0. 88 for osteotomy, and 1. 0 for fenestration. Discussion: In the few instances where planning was not perfect, implant placement was completed in a clinically acceptable manner. Conclusion: The results suggest that the image-guided system presented is reliable for the preoperative assessment of implant size and anatomic complications. It may also be reliable for flapless surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{benefit in}} terms of higher {{accuracy}} for full guided implant surgery (template based guided cavity preparation and guided implant insertion) compared with half-guided surgery (template based guided cavity preparation and free-handed, manual implant insertion) has not been proved till now. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 38 identical implants were inserted into five human cadaver jaws, after virtual implant planning with the coDiagnostiX() device. All cavities were <b>drilled</b> using <b>templates</b> equipped with tubes for guidance. At random, 19 implants were inserted in a free handed way (half-guided), whereas 19 implants were inserted in a guided way through the templates tubes (full guided). Postoperative cone beam computer tomographies (CBCT) were performed, and based on image fusion the total deviations between the virtual implant positions at the implants base and tip were determined and compared between both implantation modi. RESULTS: The mean difference in accuracy between both implantation modalities at the implants bases was 0. 72 mm (range: 0. 16 - 1. 17 mm, SD: 0. 45). The mean difference in accuracy between both modalities at the implants tips was 0. 46 mm (range: 0. 16 - 1. 23 mm. SD: 0. 49). Although full guided implantation showed a generally higher accuracy (mean tip: 1. 54 mm, range: 0. 33 - 3. 64 mm; mean base: 1. 52 mm, range: 0. 4 - 3. 54 mm) than half-guided implantation (mean tip: 1. 84 mm, range: 0. 84 - 3. 22 mm; mean base: 1. 56 mm, range: 0. 49 - 3. 43 mm), the differences were not statistically significant.
