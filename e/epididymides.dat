25|$|There are {{two major}} isoforms of 5α-reductase, SRD5A1 (type I) and SRD5A2 (type II), with the latter being the most biologically {{important}} isoenzyme. SRD5A2 is most highly expressed in the genitals, prostate gland, <b>epididymides,</b> seminal vesicles, genital skin, facial and chest hair follicles, and liver, while lower expression is observed in certain brain areas, non-genital skin/hair follicles, testes, and kidneys. SRD5A1 is most highly expressed in non-genital skin/hair follicles, the liver, and certain brain areas, while lower levels {{are present in the}} prostate, <b>epididymides,</b> seminal vesicles, genital skin, testes, adrenal glands, and kidneys. In the skin, 5α-reductase is expressed in sebaceous glands, sweat glands, epidermal cells, and hair follicles. Both isoenzymes are expressed in scalp hair follicles, although SRD5A2 predominates in these cells. The SRD5A2 subtype is the almost exclusive isoform expressed in the prostate gland.|$|E
25|$|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), {{also known}} as {{androstanolone}} or stanolone, is an endogenous androgen sex steroid and hormone. The enzyme 5α-reductase catalyzes the formation of DHT from testosterone in certain tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, <b>epididymides,</b> skin, hair follicles, liver, and brain. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 double bond of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR).|$|E
25|$|Examples of MAIS phenotypes include {{isolated}} infertility (oligospermia or azoospermia), mild gynecomastia {{in young}} adulthood, decreased secondary terminal hair, high pitched voice, or minor hypospadias repair in childhood. The external male genitalia (penis, scrotum, and urethra) are otherwise normal in individuals with MAIS. Internal genitalia, including Wolffian structures (the <b>epididymides,</b> vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) and the prostate, is also normal, although the bitesticular volume of infertile men (both {{with and without}} MAIS) is diminished; male infertility is associated with reduced bitesticular volume, varicocele, retractile testes, low ejaculate volume, male accessory gland infections (MAGI), and mumps orchitis. The incidence of these features in infertile men with MAIS {{is similar to that}} of infertile men without MAIS. MAIS is not associated with Müllerian remnants.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{immediate}} metabolites of testosterone, 5α-DHT and estradiol, are biologically important and can be formed both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues. Approximately 5 to 7% of testosterone is converted by 5α-reductase into 5α-DHT, with circulating levels of 5α-DHT about 10% of those of testosterone, and approximately 0.3% of testosterone is converted into estradiol by aromatase. 5α-Reductase is highly expressed in the male reproductive organs (including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and <b>epididymides),</b> skin, hair follicles, and brain and aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue, bone, and the brain. As much as 90% of testosterone is converted into 5α-DHT in so-called androgenic tissues with high 5α-reductase expression, and due to the several-fold greater potency of 5α-DHT as an AR agonist relative to testosterone, {{it has been estimated}} that the effects of testosterone are potentiated 2- to 3-fold in such tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Pubertal undervirilization is common, {{including}} gynecomastia, decreased {{secondary terminal}} hair, and / or a high pitched voice. [...] The phallic structure ranges from a penis {{with varying degrees}} of diminished size and hypospadias to a slightly enlarged clitoris. [...] Wolffian structures (the <b>epididymides,</b> vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) are typically partially or fully developed. [...] The prostate is typically small or impalpable. [...] Müllerian remnants are rare, but have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|Immature sperm {{cells in}} the testes do not mature past an early stage, as {{sensitivity}} to androgens is required in order for spermatogenesis to complete. [...] Germ cell malignancy risk, {{once thought to be}} relatively high, is now thought to be approximately 2%. [...] Wolffian structures (the <b>epididymides,</b> vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles) are typically absent, but will develop at least partially in approximately 30% of cases, depending on which mutation is causing the CAIS. The prostate, like the external male genitalia, cannot masculinize in the absence of androgen receptor function, and thus remains in the female form.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{around the}} seventh week of development, the embryo has {{indifferent}} sex accessory ducts, which consist of {{two pairs of}} ducts: the Müllerian ducts and the Wolffian ducts. [...] Sertoli cells within the testes secrete anti-Müllerian hormone around this time to suppress {{the development of the}} Müllerian ducts, and cause their degeneration. [...] Without this anti-Müllerian hormone, the Müllerian ducts develop into the female internal genitalia (uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and upper vaginal barrel). [...] Unlike the Müllerian ducts, the Wolffian ducts will not continue to develop by default. [...] In the presence of testosterone and functional androgen receptors, the Wolffian ducts develop into the <b>epididymides,</b> vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. [...] If the testes fail to secrete testosterone, or the androgen receptors do not function properly, the Wolffian ducts degenerate.|$|E

50|$|Post-vasectomy pain {{syndrome}} is a chronic and sometimes debilitating genital pain condition that may develop immediately or {{several years after}} vasectomy. Because this condition is a syndrome, {{there is no single}} treatment method, therefore efforts focus on mitigating/relieving the individual patient's specific pain. When pain in the <b>epididymides</b> is the primary symptom, post-vasectomy pain {{syndrome is}} often described as congestive epididymitis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{epididymis}} ( [...] ; plural: <b>epididymides</b> [...] or [...] ) is a {{tube that}} connects a testicle to a vas deferens {{in the male}} reproductive system. It is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. It is a single, narrow, tightly-coiled tube (in adult humans, six to seven meters in length) connecting the efferent ducts {{from the rear of}} each testicle to its vas deferens.|$|E
50|$|A sperm {{granuloma}} is {{a lump of}} extravasated sperm {{that appears}} along the vasa deferentia or <b>epididymides</b> in vasectomized men. Sperm granulomas are rounded or irregular in shape, one millimeter to one centimeter or more, with a central mass of degenerating sperm surrounded by tissue containing blood vessels and immune system cells. Sperm granulomas can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic (i.e., either not painful or painful, respectively) (see post-vasectomy pain syndrome).|$|E

50|$|Any of the {{aforementioned}} pain conditions/syndromes can persist for years after vasectomy and affect {{as many as one}} in three vasectomized men. The range of PVPS pain can be mild/annoying to the less-likely extreme debilitating pain experienced by a smaller number of sufferers in this group. There is a continuum of pain severity between these two extremes. Pain is thought to be caused by any of the following, either singularly or in combination: testicular backpressure, overfull <b>epididymides,</b> chronic inflammation, fibrosis, sperm granulomas, and nerve entrapment. Pain can be present continuously in the form of orchialgia and/or congestive epididymitis or it can be situational, such as pain during intercourse, ejaculation or physical exertion.|$|E
5000|$|AMH (Anti Müllerian Hormone) is {{produced}} by the primitive Sertoli cells {{as one of the}} earliest Sertoli cell products and induces regression of the Müllerian ducts. Fetal Müllerian ducts are only sensitive to AMH action around the 7th or 8th week of gestation, and Müllerian regression is completed {{by the end of the}} 9th week. The AMH induced regression of the Müllerian duct occurs in cranio-caudal direction via apoptosis. The AMH receptors are on the Müllerian duct mesenchyme and transfer the apoptotic signal to the Müllerian epithelial cell, presumably via paracrine actors. The Wolffian ducts differentiate into <b>epididymides,</b> vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles under the influence of testosterone, produced by the fetal Leydig cells ...|$|E

50|$|In November the {{commencement}} of spermatogenesis takes place in males which peaks in March and ends in May. The <b>epididymides</b> hold the sperm as the testes retreat. In April mating usually initiates, with the female then using the oviduct and the uterine lining to hold sperm over the winter. In late August to September ovulation and fertilisation takes place with gestation lasting between 72-93 days. In late October through to November (later in lower latitudes and elevations) births take place, with the mother often producing twins. The young can fly by December while early February sees the ceasing of lactation. Tasmania has reported shorted lactation periods. Mature females will not always birth every year. This species has demonstrations of sperm competition.|$|E
50|$|If sperm {{were seen}} in one or both vas {{contents}} {{at the time of}} surgery, or sperm reached the patient’s semen only transiently after the reversal, microsurgical vasovasostomy may be successful. Unfortunately, surgeons performing only an occasional vasectomy reversal often neglect examining the vas contents for presence or absence of sperm. A surgeon cannot determine sperm presence or absence by the naked eye. The most common cause for failed vasectomy reversals is the inappropriate non-microsurgical technique using sutures that are too large to achieve watertight reconnections. The failure of a competently performed microsurgical vasovasostomy following the absence of any sperm in the contents of each vas usually is due to “blowouts” in the <b>epididymides.</b> Under these circumstances an operation should be performed only by a micro-surgeon with proven vasoepididymostomy expertise, bypassing the blowouts.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{noticeable}} {{increase in pressure}} within the vas deferens on the testicular side following vasectomy. The <b>epididymides</b> of vasectomized men are often swollen and distended from backpressure effects. The efferent ducts and seminiferous tubules of the testes are also impacted by backpressure, leading {{to an increase in}} area and thickness. Backpressure from blockage of the vas deferens causes a rupture in the epididymis, called an [...] "epididymal blowout", in over half of vasectomy patients. Sperm sometimes leak from the vas deferens of vasectomized men, forming lesions in the scrotum known as sperm granulomas. Some sperm granulomas can be painful. Paradoxically, the presence of a sperm granuloma at the vasectomy site prevents epididymal pressure build-up, perforation, and the formation of an epididymal sperm granuloma. It thus lessens the likelihood of epididymal discomfort.|$|E

50|$|Males {{and females}} {{are capable of}} {{successful}} reproduction after their first year, and most females first give birth at age two or three. Mating is thought to occur in February and March, shortly before hibernation, based on the proportion of males with swollen <b>epididymides</b> at this time.Females {{give birth to a}} single pup during austral summer (December and January) and provide sole care for their young, gathering with other females in maternity roosts of up to 120 individuals; small numbers of adult males and nonreproductive females are present in the roosts as well. These subcolonies move to new trees almost every day, breaking apart into smaller groups or reforming into larger ones. In some areas limestone caves are also used but mainly as a night roost between feeding bouts. Pups fledge about 40 days after birth. Pups are likely weaned within ten days of fledging.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the histopathological effects of excess L-cysteine on the male rat reproductive tract during sexual maturation. Male 6 -week-old Sprague–Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally daily with L-cysteine, 1, 000 mg/kg body weight, for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. L-Cysteine-treated rats developed sperm granulomas in the <b>epididymides</b> at an incidence of 0 % (0 / 6), 50 % (3 / 6), 83 % (5 / 6), and 100 % (6 / 6) in rats examined at study weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. These sperm granulomas were unilateral or bilateral, and most frequently involved the proximal cauda {{region of the}} <b>epididymides.</b> Interestingly, small ducts, indicative of immaturity, were seen frequently in L-cysteine-treated rats. These {{findings suggest that the}} maturation of <b>epididymides</b> in L-cysteine-treated rats might be delayed. Additionally, dilated ducts and interstitial edema, suggestive of an increase in intraluminal pressure, were seen often in the <b>epididymides</b> of L-cysteine-treated rats. Labeling spermatozoa and epithelial cells with monobromobimane indicated no influence of the thiol–disulfide status of L-cysteine to the <b>epididymides.</b> The testes and prostate glands also showed no effects, suggesting that inhibited epididymis maturation was not a result of hormonal deficiencies. We speculate that defective development of the ducts might result in aberrant fluid flow, leading to ductal rupture in the <b>epididymides.</b> In that case, sperm granulomas might form around leaked spermatozoa...|$|E
40|$|Leiomyoma is a {{relatively}} uncommon neoplasm of the epididymis derived from smooth muscle cells.

Our study investigated effect of elaidic acid (ELA), the predominant TFA, on deficits of sperma-togenesis induced by ACR. Results showed that ELA enhanced the decreases of spermatogonia along with mature sperms after treatment of ACR, and that spermatozoa quality was significantly reduced by addition of ELA to mice treated with ACR.

The domestic cat (Felis catus) is a good model for wild felids and, using this model, we have explored the effect of <b>epididymides</b> storage time on sperm motility and percentage of intact acrosomes upon sperm recovery and after cryopreservation. We also examined the effect of time of sperm equilibration with glycerol before freezing on sperm motility and the percentage of intact acrosomes. Motility varied between sperm recovered from <b>epididymides</b> that were stored for different times. Significant differences were seen in the sperm motility index (SMI) before freezing (55. 91 2. 02, 48. 21 1. 47, and 43. 03 1. 32) and after thawing (51. 81 3. 02, 41. 90 2. 14, and 42. 35 1. 95) of sperm recovered from <b>epididymides</b> stored for 0, 48, or 72 h, respectively. The percentage of intact acrosomes did not vary significantly with storage time (average 60. 33 1. 38 % before and 52. 50 1. 91 % after freezing, respectively). The percentage of normal sperm after different storage times did not differ (average 19. 22 1. 25 % normal sperm after recovery). When <b>epididymides</b> were stored for 72 h, time of sperm equilibration with glycerol (30 vs. 120 min) resulted in significant differences in both motility (SMI = 39. 17 2. 76 and 45. 00 2. 65, respectively) and the percentage of intact acrosomes (45. 76 4. 91 % and 60. 67 3. 64 %, respectively) after thawing. In conclusion, best results are achieved when sperm are recovered from <b>epididymides</b> within 24 h of cool storage and when they are equilibrated with glycerol during 120 min before freezing.

Pre-pubescent males had testes with solid seminiferous cords and spermatogenesis only to the stage of gonocytes. Their <b>epididymides</b> had empty lumina along their entire length. The testes of three males undergoing puberty had some lumen formation and mitotic activity. Their <b>epididymides</b> were similar in appearance to those of adult males but were entirely devoid of any cells within the lumen of the duct. Three other pubescent males showed full lumen formation in the testes and spermatogenesis up to the elongating spermatid stage.

However, cells of testicular origin {{were found in the}} lumen of the duct in all regions suggesting that testicular fluids and immature germ cells shed into the rete testes flow through the seminiferous tubules into the epididymis before the release of mature testicular spermatozoa. The weights of testes and <b>epididymides</b> of adult males showed no change throughout the year but prostate weight and plasma androgen concentrations varied significantly with season, with maximums in spring and summer and minimums in winter. The volume fraction of Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules was significantly lower in winter than in summer; but, despite this, maturing spermatozoa were found in the testes throughout the year. Females in the area conceived year-round, suggesting that seasonal changes in the male reproductive tract did not prevent at least some males from breeding throughout the year...|$|E
