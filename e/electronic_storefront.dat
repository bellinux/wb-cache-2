50|$|Warner Brothers-Xbox integration: EIDR {{was used}} to improve the {{implementation}} of an Electronic Sell Through (EST) system for delivering Warner Theatrical titles to Microsoft Xbox Live customers. The operation of an <b>electronic</b> <b>storefront</b> requires several groups within Warner Brothers to coordinate their activities with the Xbox team. The outbound side of the distribution chain included publishing “Avails” (titles available for sale) and tracking order fulfillment; the inbound side included placing orders. Other functions such as reports spanned {{both sides of the}} distribution chain. The original system required manual intervention and supervision, particularly at boundaries between organizations. An example of the need for manual processing would be verifying that the correct version of an asset (which can vary depending on subtitles or content) was delivered. In the new system Warner Brothers created a new EIDR ID for each content variant, and these were used for all subsequent processing stages. This eliminated ambiguity and facilitated the automation of the inbound, outbound stages. Another advantage was the ability to create reports on the fly.|$|E
40|$|Online {{trust is}} growing in importance. Consumers and businesses, feeling the {{pressure}} of economic downturn and terrorism, increasingly look to buy from and {{do business with the}} most trusted Web sites. Companies’ perception of customer trust has steadily evolved from being a construct involving security and privacy issues to a multidimensional, complex construct that includes credibility, emotional comfort and quality. Further, trust online spans the end-to-end aspects of e-business rather than being just based on the <b>electronic</b> <b>storefront.</b> Based on a review of selected studies, we propose a stakeholder theory of trust, articulate a broad conceptual framework of online trust including its underlying elements, antecedents, and consequences, and propose some promising future research avenues in online trust...|$|E

This research will evaluate purchasing problems and issues in current on-line contracting/procurement programs including GSA Advantage, DoD E-Mall, and other current on-line purchasing programs {{as they relate}} to contracting and purchasing of supplies and services. The issues and concerns with legacy on-line procurement systems will be compared to a newly developed Pure Electronic Ordering System (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Storefront)</b> recently developed by Prof. Ron Tudor and students at the Naval Postgraduate School. This new program is currently under testing by a prime contractor {{under the auspices of the}} Department of Interior. The new on-line contracting/procurement program will allow Federal, State and Local Government users to purchase supplies and services on-line through the use of the Internet, through the use of electronic catalogs and embedded contract templates. This thesis will consider some of the functions of the new program and how the new program addresses the issues and concerns identified with the current legacy on-line procurement programs as well as additional benefits the new program will encompass compared to legacy systems.

40|$|E-commerce, {{which is}} short for ‘Electronic Commerce’, is simply the idea of {{replacing}} physical business transactions with electronic business transactions using the Internet. E-commerce cuts through boundaries such as time and geography to put business owners and customers into virtual contact with one another. A key idea behind E-commerce {{is the ability to}} take orders and receive payments through an <b>electronic</b> <b>storefront.</b> Philosophically, E-commerce is about openness, connectivity, and integration between businesses and customers. From the business owner’s perspective, E-commerce provides a way to instantly satisfy demand for products, services, and information of each customer individually. From the customer’s perspective E-commerce offers convenience, variety, cost savings, and anonymity. Ultimately, E-commerce shifts the power from the merchant to the consumer. E-commerce also provides a way for the business to connect its customers, vendors, suppliers and employees all over the world. The business, as such, is now capable of reaching an infinite number of customers over the Web, seeking out potential markets that were once outside its traditional business boundaries. [5] E-commerce is a growing area of business and the number of online buyers is increasing exponentially. Further to the issues highlighted previously, that effect the Internet structure as a whole...|$|E

As the number of Internet users is increasing each day and the sphere of influence extending, making business without Internet becomes impossible. Using the Internet tools in marketing communicational system provides such benefits:- tracking (ability of making analysis of the consumer preferences);- targeting (accurate sweep of the target group);- availability;- interactivity;- ability to place more useful information for the customers;- advisory activity or after-sales service at any time;- boundless working;- ability of creation of the online communities around the production;- time economy (especially {{in the sphere of}} tourism or finance) and more productivity. Main methods of using the Internet tools in marketing communication include:- Opening the Internet “representative office”. There it would be efficient to put the information about the company and production, price lists, professional pieces of advice, articles of the outside experts about the production, ordering form.

40|$|ABSTRACT Building {{long-term}} customer relationships through {{customer satisfaction}} {{is one of}} the crucial keys to successful marketing including internet marketing. An organisation exists to satisfy customer wants and needs while meeting organisational objectives of increased sales and higher profit. The Internet is now firmly established as a new marketing tool. Marketers use the Internet to gather data for marketing planning. The Net has become an integral piece of the marketing mix, spawning new products and serving as both a digital distribution channel and an <b>electronic</b> <b>storefront.</b> Malaysians have not yet fully appreciated the benefits of Internet marketing in bringing increased customer satisfaction. However, this study indicates that there is a positive trend in increasing awareness of the benefits of Internet marketing. Some of them such as global access and the 24 -hour availability of the Internet, convenience, increase product information, and the availability of special services in the Internet were recognised as ways of enhancing customer satisfaction. One significant obstacle expressed by the respondents in this research was the fear of payment in security in the Internet. The time for rapid development in Internet marketing has come. It is inevitable that more and more businesses are and will be going online. The question in everyone’s mind is, “Will Internet marketing bring increased customer satisfaction, and hence, increased sales and profitability? ” The objective of this research is aimed at studying how Malaysians view Internet marketing in comparison with traditional marketing as a tool in building long-term customer relationships through customer satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Companies {{are finding}} that the {{development}} of World Wide Web presence sites is becoming a competitive necessity, particularly the need to establish online storefronts. Even so, there are few useful frameworks in the electronic commerce (EC) literature to help managers identify online opportunities and what types of applications can add business value to the user. I expand on an existing framework originally developed by Hammer and Mangurian [1] to identify opportunities from Web-based EC applications. I argue that firms compete along 5 dimensions of commerce: By using various modes of interaction, firms compete over both time and distance to provide some product or service to their customers through a chain of relations. In addition, new investments in information technology are typically justified using 3 different criteria—generating efficiency, effectiveness, and/or strategic benefits. These 2 perspectives can be combined to create the Electronic Commerce Value Grid, which identifies 15 areas in which managers can use Web-based <b>electronic</b> <b>storefronts</b> to add value for their customers...|$|R
40|$|E-Commerce {{has been}} much more popular in western {{countries}} where the development of E-Commerce systems has been relatively matured. While the technology and social credit environment are well developed, E-Commerce is relatively new and receives less acceptance within commercial industries in China.

In this paper, we will develop an computational model, which may be used to improve the trust-building relationship among consumers, retailers and authorities. This model considers a number of factors including direct experiences, customer recommendations, and authority certification, while parties involved in the E-Commerce activities can confidently establish and reliably enhance the trustworthiness. We also conduct a case study on how to improve consumer-retailer trust relationship in an E-Commerce application by the use of the trust model, which is one of functional <b>electronic</b> <b>storefronts</b> with the consideration of trustworthiness in China.

40|$|Growth of {{business-to-consumer}} (B 2 C) {{applications such}} as <b>electronic</b> <b>storefronts,</b> catalogues, and customer support websites has drawn {{a great number of}} diverse stakeholders into the IS Development (ISD) practice. Marketing, strategy, and graphic design specialists have joined a variety of technical professionals and business stakeholders in developing B 2 C applications. Oftentimes, these professionals work for different organizations with different histories, cultures, and reward structures. A longitudinal qualitative field study of a B 2 C application development project was undertaken in order to build an in-depth understanding of the collaborative practices of diverse professionals in ISD projects. The paper proposes that the multi-party collaborative practice can be understood as a âcollective reflection-in-actionâ cycle through which an IS design emerges as a result of agents producing, sharing, and reflecting upon material objects. Agents from diverse backgrounds exert different influences over emergent designs depending on their organization, profession, and project involvement-based power relations. These power relations shape whether collaborators âadd toâ âignore,â or âchallengeâ the work produced by others. In turn, agentsâ actions either reinforce or transform existing power relations depending on who gets to claim credit for and ownership of the emergent design. Implications for the study of boundary objects, team diversity, organizational learning, and contemporary ISD are drawn. ...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{has evolved}} from an {{information}} space to a market space with thousands, potentially millions, of <b>electronic</b> <b>storefronts,</b> auctions and other commercial services. This creates great opportunities, but is not without problems. One major problem is the difficulty of finding relevant offers. Another problem is coping with the multitude of different styles of web-based user interfaces to different marketplaces. Yet another problem is how to automate routine tasks in such an environment. We present one possible solution to these problems. An agent-based market infrastructure, in which agents support all users and services, helps customers and commercial sites find matching interests, and, if desired, negotiate and close deals. The infrastructure is entirely open and decentralized. Each participant has an agent that acts {{in the interest of}} its owner. Interaction is entirely symmetric. Any participant can play any role on a market. In this paper we present an integration of such an infrastructure, SICS MarketSpace, with the web. Personal assistant agents help users in their interaction with services and are able to handle routine tasks off-line. Agent-enabled services are able to adapt to the interests of their users, even on their first visit, and are provided with a mechanism to take the first initiative (push) in a highly focused manner.

Drawing on the paradigm of search and experience goods from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness. An analysis of 1, 587 reviews from Amazon. com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review. Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review. For experience goods, reviews with extreme ratings are less help-ful than reviews with moderate ratings. For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review. Review depth has a greater positive effect on the helpfulness of the review for search goods than for experience goods. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice...|$|R
