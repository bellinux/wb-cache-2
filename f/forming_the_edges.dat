50|$|Forward speed (5-13 km/h) and {{steering}} {{can be achieved}} by cuts in various sections (gores) across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape {{from the back of the}} canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various sections (gores) to cause some of the skirt to bow out. Turning is accomplished by <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at landing.|$|E
50|$|The area {{generally}} {{became known}} as Rimrock in 1928 when Virginia Finnie, {{the daughter of a}} prominent local rancher, married Romaine Lowdermilk and the couple along with partner Russell Boardman started a dude ranch originally called Rimrock Lodge later known as Rimrock Dude Ranch. It was so named for the prominent limestone rimrocks <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the mesas visible from the hill top ranch. Her prominent guests were wanting efficient communications with the outside world so Virginia saw the need to establish a post office on the ranch. Virginia's Mother-in-law, Ella Loudermilk, became the first post mistress of the newly established Rimrock Post Office chartered July 11, 1928. People from the Coconino County line near Stoneman Lake, Apache Maid Ranch etc. and up and down the creek nearly to Camp Verde, picked up their mail at the Rimrock Post Office. The former area of Beaver Creek School district thus generally {{became known as}} Rimrock. Interestingly, one of Arizona's oldest continuously operated landing strips - The Rimrock Airport - is located here as dudes used to fly into the ranch in days gone by.|$|E
50|$|The shoals in {{this area}} were already marked by a stone daybeacon when the {{lighthouse}} board recommended construction of a light in 1871. This followed some years of unsuccessful attempts to replace the lightship at Hog Island Shoal with a fixed light (the two shoals <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the channel leading into Mount Hope Bay). Appropriation was made in 1873 and the first light was activated in August of the same year. The form of the structure remained essentially the same over the years: a small square house with a lantern and fog bell set on the roof, all perched on a pier of stone blocks scarcely larger than the house itself. The building, however, had to be rebuilt or massively repaired several times over the years, due to damage from moving ice. Damage to the pier {{in the winter of}} 1875 (the whole structure was shifted some four feet) led to enlargement of the pier in 1878, with the house being temporarily relocated to shore. In 1920 the pier was again damaged by ice, and four years later the house was rebuilt, the original single room dwelling being enlarged to four rooms.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a sparsity based optical flow estimation method in digital video sequences.

The legal interpretation of this partition is opening new untraditional lines of research.

This improves over previous results in two ways: Firstly, the best previously known upper bound for the 1 -bend planar slope number was 3 / 2 (Delta- 1) (the known lower bound being 3 / 4 (Delta- 1)); secondly, all the known algorithms to construct 1 -bend planar drawings with O(Delta) slopes use a different set of slopes for each graph and can have bad angular resolution, while our algorithm uses a universal set of slopes, which also guarantees that the minimum angle between any two edges incident to a vertex is pi/(Delta- 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Ciliates of Euplotes species constitutively secrete {{pleiotropic}} protein pheromones, {{which are}} capable {{to function as}} prototypic autocrine growth factors as well as paracrine inducers of mating processes. This paper reports the amino acid sequence and the NMR structure of the pheromone En- 6 isolated from the antarctic species Euplotes nobilii. The 63 -residue En- 6 polypeptide chain forms three α-helices in positions 18 – 25, 36 – 40 and 46 – 56, which are arranged in an up-down-up three-helix bundle <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of a distorted trigonal pyramid. The base of the pyramid is covered by the N-terminal heptadecapeptide segment, which includes a 310 -turn of residues 3 – 6. This topology is covalently anchored by four long-range disulfide bonds. Comparison with the smaller pheromones of E. raikovi, a closely related species living in temperate waters, shows that the twopheromone families have the same three-helix bundle architecture. It then appears that cold-adaptation of the En proteins is primarily related to increased lengths of the chain-terminal peptide segments and the surfaceexposed loops connecting the regular secondary structures, and {{to the presence of}} solvent-exposed clusters of negatively charged side-chains...|$|E
40|$|Context. Outflows {{powered by}} the {{injection}} of kinetic energy from massive stars can strongly affect the chemical evolution of galaxies, in particular of dwarf galaxies, as their lower gravitational potentials enhance {{the chance of a}} galactic wind. Aims. We therefore performed a detailed kinematic analysis of the neutral and ionised gas components in the nearby star-forming irregular dwarf galaxy NGC 4861. Similar to a recently published study of NGC 2366, we want to make predictions about the fate of the gas and to discuss some general issues about this galaxy. Methods. Fabry-Perot interferometric data centred on the Halpha line were obtained with the 1. 93 m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. They were complemented by HI synthesis data from the VLA. We performed a Gaussian decomposition of both the Halpha and the HI emission lines in order to search for multiple components indicating outflowing gas. The expansion velocities of the detected outflows were compared to the escape velocity of NGC 4861, which was modelled with a pseudo-isothermal halo. Results. Both in Halpha and HI the galaxy shows several outflows, three directly connected to the disc and probably <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of a supergiant shell, and one at kpc-distance from the disc. We measured velocity offsets of 20 to 30 km/s, which are low in comparison to the escape velocity of the galaxy and therefore minimise the chance of a galactic wind.

40|$|International audienceTwo Co 2 + metal-organic {{framework}} materials, {{constructed from}} a combination of 1, 4 -benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) and either 2, 2 '-dipyridyl-N-oxide (DPNO) or 2, 2 '-dipyridyl-N,N'-dioxide (DPNDO), are synthesized under solvothermal reaction conditions, and their structures solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Both have three-dimensional structures that contain octahedral Co 2 + centers with mu 2 -(eta(2)) -BDC, and bidentate DPNO or DPNDO coligands that bridge pairs of metal centers but do not contribute toward the overall connectivity of the framework. Co- 3 (BDC) (3) (DPNO) (2) contains trimers of trans corner-shared Co-centered octahedra with one type of bridging BDC ligand forming terminal edges of the trimers, bridging to neighboring trimer units, and a second type, bridging pairs of metals and also connecting neighboring trimers. Co- 2 (BDC) (2) (DPNDO) is constructed from one-dimensional inorganic chains consisting of cis- and trans-corner shared Co 2 +-centered octahedra. The DPNDO ligand is bis-bidentate, <b>forming</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of one type of octahedron and the trans corners of the second type, with the coordination for both octahedra completed by bridging BDC linkers, which in turn connect the inorganic chains to yield a three-dimensional structure. Thermogravimetric analysis shows both materials contain trapped solvent, and while Co- 3 (BDC) (3) (DPNO) (2) is unstable with respect to solvent loss, Co- 2 (BDC) (2) (DPNDO), and its magnesium analogue, can be desolvated to yield permanently porous materials that show thermal stability up to 300 degrees C. For Co- 2 (BDC) (2) (DPNDO), gas adsorption studies show permanent microporosity with moderate uptake of small gas molecules (N- 2, CO 2, CH 4, and C 2 H 6), supported by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo calculations based on the assumption of rigid crystal structures, while gravimetric analysis shows rapid and reversible methanol adsorption at ambient pressure for both the Co and Mg analogues of the framework...|$|E
