40|$|Estimating {{the noise}} {{parameter}} in magnitude magnetic resonance (MR) images {{is important in}} a wide range of applications. We propose an automatic noise estimation method that does not rely on a substantial proportion of voxels being from the background. Specifically, we model the magnitude of the observed signal as a mixture of Rice distributions with common noise parameter. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters, including the common noise parameter. The algorithm needs initializing values for which we provide some strategies that work well. The number of components in the mixture model also need to be <b>estimated</b> <b>en</b> <b>route</b> to noise estimation and we provide a novel approach to doing so. Our methodology performs very well on a range of simulation experiments and physical phantom data. Finally, the methodology is demonstrated on four clinical datasets...|$|E
40|$|Blind image {{deblurring}} is {{a particularly}} challenging inverse problem where the blur kernel is unknown and must be <b>estimated</b> <b>en</b> <b>route</b> to recover the deblurred image. The problem is of strong practical relevance since many imaging devices such as cellphone cameras, must rely on deblurring algorithms to yield satisfactory image quality. Despite significant research effort, handling large motions remains an open problem. In this paper, we develop a new method called Blind Image Deblurring using Row-Column Sparsity (BD-RCS) to address this issue. Specifically, we model the outer product of kernel and image coefficients in certain transformation domains as a rank-one matrix, and recover it by solving a rank minimization problem. Our central contribution then includes solving two new optimization problems involving row and column sparsity to automatically determine blur kernel and image support sequentially. The kernel and image can then be recovered through a singular value decomposition (SVD). Experimental results on linear motion deblurring demonstrate that BD-RCS can yield better results than state of the art, particularly when the blur is caused by large motion. This is confirmed both visually and through quantitative measures. Comment: Accepted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters, December 201...|$|E

30|$|Given the {{significance}} of dwell times within the timetable planning phase, the suggested approach has considerable potential which is worth investigating in greater depth in forthcoming works. First of all, {{it would be possible}} to include the rail crowding theory in the proposed modelling architecture by providing further important information which would enrich the analysis, enabling an <b>estimate</b> of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> passenger discomfort, perhaps even differentiating between passengers standing or sitting. This could contribute to improve the traditional approach proposed in the literature, according to which waiting time is worth three times on-board time.|$|R
40|$|The time to fly {{between two}} {{airports}} can vary significantly {{from day to}} day and flight to flight. This variability is an indication of possible operational problems, because flight times should ideally be very consistent. Some of the variation is systemic in origin, caused either by weather or by <b>en</b> <b>route</b> or terminal area congestion. The remaining variation is idiosyncratic and attributable to factors within an airline s control, such as route planning. It is of interest to the FAA to estimate the systemic component of variability because the FAA is responsible for the expeditious (and safe) movement of traffic. We study two types of daily variations in average point-to-point air times: variations around long-run average air times, and deviations from <b>estimated</b> times <b>en</b> <b>route</b> filed in flight plans. This analysis decomposes variations in air time into four components: day (system-wide) effects, origin (departure airport) effects, destination (arrival airport) effects, and residual (<b>en</b> <b>route)</b> effects. We illustrate the methodology with data for afternoon air times in the eastern US. The methodology uncovered interesting relationships within and between origin, destination, and <b>en</b> <b>route</b> effects. It can be used to focus attention on times and airspaces impeding consistent flight and to provide the basis for a graphical display of airspace problems...|$|R

5000|$|Flight {{plans are}} {{documents}} filed by a pilot or flight dispatcher {{with the local}} Civil Aviation Authority (e.g. FAA in the USA) prior to departure which indicate the plane's planned route or flight path. Flight plan format is specified in the ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, <b>estimated</b> time <b>en</b> <b>route,</b> alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules IFR or visual flight rules VFR), the pilot's information, number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, flight plans are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. Flight plans are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas, such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a special type of VFR flight plan called a DVFR (Defense VFR) flight plan must be filed.For IFR flights, flight plans are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services. For VFR flights, their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required, or for use by air traffic control when flying in a [...] "Special Flight Rules Area".|$|R

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals. The development of the advanced turboprop (propfan) engine, modifications to air corridors, and the desire to maintain a natural environment in national parks and recreation areas have now focused attention on the impact at ground level of the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise produced by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes. Compared to terminal area noise, <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise is characterized by relatively low noise levels, lack of high frequency spectral content, and long durations. Much research has been directed towards understanding and quantifying the annoyance caused by terminal area aircraft noise, but relatively little research has been conducted for <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise. To address this need, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance of people on the ground to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The objectives of the experiment are to determine the annoyance prediction ability of noise measurement procedures and corrections when applied to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise; to determine differences in annoyance response to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and takeoff/landing noise; and to determine differences in annoyance response to advanced turboprop <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and conventional jet <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise...|$|R

40|$|While airport {{congestion}} {{has long}} been viewed as a major air traffic management problem in the United States, congestion in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace is drawing an increasing amount of attention. Sources of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion, such as severe weather, often cause the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to delay and reroute aircraft {{in order to ensure}} safety. Most current research into methods for managing <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion seeks to reduce delay or aid in aircraft rerouting. However, there has been less attention paid to delay and reroute allocation methods ï”­ an area in which {{there appears to be a}} pressing, practical need. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is a movement within the air traffic management community that has combined the interests of the FAA and industry to develop a universally-accepted resource rationing process for congested airports. There is high expectation that CDM can achieve similar success in developing a parallel rationing process for the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace. The CDM-inspired research underlying this thesis led to the development of a software tool, the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Resource Allocation Prototype (ERAP), that supports the analysis of alternative <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace rationing methods. In this thesis, we define a basic <b>en</b> <b>route</b> traffic flow management scenario, conduct experiments, and derive ERAP results which provide insight into rationing resources in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace domain.
