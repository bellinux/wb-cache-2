Although imperfect, existing multilateral instruments are far from fully exploited and provide significant opportunities for governments to further open access to markets.

5000|$|Modern {{political}} science pioneer Seymour Martin Lipset argues that Marshall proposes {{a model of}} social science based on the middle range analysis of social structures and institutions, as opposed to grand theories {{of the purposes of}} development and modernisation, which were criticised by modern sociologists such as Robert K. Merton for being too speculative to provide valid results. By using such a middle range approach, Marshall and his mentor L. T. Hobhouse believed that rigid class distinctions could be dissolved and middle class citizenship generalised through a careful understanding of social mechanisms. He also believed this would allow sociology to become an <b>international</b> <b>discipline,</b> helping [...] "to increase mutual understanding between cultures" [...] and further international co-operation. [...] While employing some concepts from Marxist conflict theory, such as social class and revolution, Marshall's analyses are based on functionalist concerns with phenomena such as [...] "consensus, the normal, and anomie; co-operation and conflict; structure and growth," [...] within self-contained systems. Rather than studying [...] "society," [...] which may include non-systemic elements, Marshall argues that the task of sociology is: ...|$|E

5000|$|Some persons, whose minds {{have not}} as yet {{received}} sufficient light, have been wondering {{why it was}} necessary to gather in a Universal Federation the Initiatique Orders and Societies, which, in their own field of work, enjoy the most absolute and complete freedom and perfect autonomy and independence. To this query we may reply that, more than in anything else, it is the initiatique work that the greatest vigilance is indispensable and that a strict and active <b>international</b> <b>discipline</b> must be exercised. We must acknowledge and regret, that there exist many false prophets and a number of so-called initiates who use, for selfish and tyrannical purposes of domination, the pretext of initiation to thrust themselves on, and exploit, gullible and sincere persons. It was high time to warn the public against these false leaders and against noxious doctrines which they taught to trusting souls. In each country, each authentic and regular Order knows its imitators and such false prophets. It was necessary to watch these clandestine movements, to expose these impostors or instruments of hidden and unavowed forces, in all countries, wherever they be operating, and thus avoid any confusion between the regular and authentic Orders and false Organizations that are harmful or that give teachings {{that have nothing to do}} with the Universal Tradition and Esoterism. And also it was necessary that the authentic Orders be careful in selecting their members and their officers and in maintaining their adepts and students on the right path of the true doctrines, obliging them to follow a strict line of discipline, rational, sincere and conscientious work, so as to avoid radical teachings and heterodoxy. This immense work which was intended to protect the Orders against their inner and outer enemies has been successfully carried on by the F.U.D.O.S.I. and is now going on. ("F.U.D.O.S.I., the."
