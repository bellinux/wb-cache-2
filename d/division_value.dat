40|$|CNRS : 2; AERES: AInternational audienceIf {{a player}} {{is removed from}} a game, what keeps the payoff of the {{remaining}} players unchanged? Is it the removal of a special player or its presence among the remaining players? This article answers this question in a complement study to Kamijo and Kongo (2012). We introduce axioms of invariance from player deletion in presence of a special player. In particular, if the special player is a nullifying player (resp. dummifying player), then the equal <b>division</b> <b>value</b> (resp. equal surplus <b>division</b> <b>value)</b> {{is characterized by the}} associated axiom of invariance plus efficiency and balanced cycle contributions. There is no type of special player from such a combination of axioms that characterizes the Shapley value...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a hardware design of an arctangent processor for the OFDM-based wireless LAN system. The arctangent processor {{is required in}} most OFDM-based communication system to estimate the frequency offset. The proposed arctangent processor {{does not require the}} <b>division</b> <b>value</b> of imaginary/real for the input argument, and uses these two values, respectively, to look up the tangent ROM table. We reduce the tangent look-up table size to one eighth of 2 π rad using the imaginary and real component exchange method for memory size and operation speed. Consequently, the designed arctangent process for wireless LAN system takes seven clocks to evaluate an arctangent value and has the resolution of 2 π/ 512 rad. The maximum absolute error of this arctangent hardware is 5. 75 e- 3 rad (0. 33 °) comparing to mathematical result...|$|E

As part of the asset swap, Boehringer and Merial sold a number of assets to Ceva Santé Animale - namely some animal health vaccines and pharmaceuticals from the Merial portfolio for swine, bovine and companion animals, as well as some intellectual property, manufacturing processes and R&D activities.

Taking East Baoxing River Catchment as the study area, the authors developed a method combining Moving Window based Calculation and Spatial Correlation Analysis to analyze the relationship between fragmentation and related spatial factors at a local scale, aiming to examine the spatial distribution rule of the landscape fragmentation and provide scientific support for the conservation of landscape ecology in the study area. From the perspective of the whole study area, although there is no clear relationship between the selected factors and the Change of DIVISION (CODIV), the comparison of R values in the latter interval (2006 – 2013) with those in the former interval (1999 – 2006) proves that the human activities of plant building have led to the increase in the <b>DIVISION</b> <b>value.</b> At the local scale, results show that a high positive relationship exists between slope and CODIV (R = 0. 857, p-value = 0. 05), while the relationship between river distance and CODIV is highly negative (R = − 0. 837, p-value = 0. 01).

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{individual}} and organizational learning mechanisms leading {{to the evolution of}} the <b>division</b> of <b>value</b> between economic actors under a given contractual arrangement. Focusing on the <b>division</b> of <b>value</b> between a firm and its employees, we theorize that following a change in the organizational incentive structure, employees learn, over time and with experience, how to be more productive under the implied objectives of the incentive regime, as well as how to game or exploit it. Results, based on outlet-level data from a Polish commercial bank over a 13 -month period, show that the bank outlets' value creation (sales revenue from primary loans) and value appropriation (the sum of outlet employees' monthly bonus) both increased, at a decreasing rate, over time as outlet employees gained experience under the new incentive regime. In parallel, the bank's share (the percentage of value created by outlets retained by the bank) increased at first, then, after reaching a plateau, decreased continuously, indicating that the ability of the incentive regime to induce the intended results evolved, giving rise to an incentive lifecycle. In exploring the underlying micromechanisms, we found strong quantitative and qualitative evidence for the presence and relative paces of productive and adverse learning in bank outlets, {{as well as for the}} role of prior experience. This is the first empirical study to show that individual and organizational learning processes can influence the evolution of the <b>division</b> of <b>value</b> between economic actors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we deduce general {{multiplication}} formulas for hypercomplex monogenic and polymonogenic generalizations of Eisenstein {{series that}} are related to translation groups. In particular, a criterion for paravector multiplication of arbitrary finite-dimensional lattices in terms of being integral is developed. Under these number theoretical conditions it is then possible to transfer the concept of the complex multiplication of the ℘-function to the framework of its hypercomplex higher dimensional analogues within the Clifford analysis setting. We derive explicit formulas for the hypercomplex <b>division</b> <b>values</b> of the hypercomplex monogenic and polymonogenic Eisenstein series for lattices with hypercomplex multiplication. We also provide applications to the function theory. In particular, it will be shown that a non-constant polymonogenic function that satisfies one of the specific integer multiplication formulas of the Clifford-analytic Eisenstein series must have singularities. Furthermore, it coincides with one of those polymonogenic Eisenstein series whenever all the singularities are distributed {{in the form of a}} lattice and have all the same order and principal parts...|$|R
