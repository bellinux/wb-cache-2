40|$|The TMT Software System {{consists}} of software components that interact {{with one another}} through a software infrastructure called TMT Common Software (CSW). CSW {{consists of}} software services and library code that is used by developers to create the subsystems and components that participate in the software system. CSW also defines the types of components that can be constructed and their roles. The use of common component types and shared middleware services allows standardized software interfaces for the components. A software system called the TMT Interface Database System was constructed to support the documentation of the interfaces for components based on CSW. The programmer describes a subsystem and each of its components using JSON-style text files. A command interface file describes each command a component can receive and any commands a component sends. The event interface files describe status, alarms, and events a component publishes and status and events subscribed to by a component. A web application was created to provide a user interface for the required features. Files are ingested into the software system’s database. The user interface allows browsing subsystem interfaces, publishing versions of subsystem interfaces, and constructing and publishing <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> that consist of the intersection of two subsystem interfaces. All published subsystem <b>interfaces</b> and <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> are versioned for configuration control and follow the standard TMT change <b>control</b> processes.

40|$|Abstract. Avionic {{systems have}} been {{migrating}} from the legacy federated ar-chitecture towards an integrated modular architecture (IMA). The IMA archi-tecture replaces the equipment principle {{by a set of}} interoperable components (hardware and software). The interoperability between the integrated compo-nents requires a detailed specification and description of their interfaces, which, in the avionic domain, is usually written in <b>Interface</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Documents</b> (ICD). However, ICD creation and usage during the integration process is challenging. In fact, the two main problems with the usage of ICDs are the lack of a com-monly accepted language to define and use them on the one hand, and the lack of tool support in their production and consumption. In this paper, we present our approach and methodology to overcome these limitations...|$|R

40|$|A {{graphical}} {{representation of the}} system under design in form of diagrams is a powerful way to present complex relationships. Diagrams appear in almost every concurrent design activity in some way sooner or later in the process. Generally they help to explain the design or give an overview so that the other stakeholders can quickly understand a (sub-) system build-up or a proposed solution. Furthermore diagrams are also important for documentation purposes (presentations, reports, <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> <b>documents).</b> Typically the diagrams are made in some external tool and the content is not linked to the constantly changing system model. Especially considering the fast pace of concurrent design studies, such diagrams become quickly inconsistent and outdated, thus breaking the model-based paradigm. This is the motivation for the work {{presented in this paper}} to include basic support for graphical modeling within the Model-based System Engineering tool called Virtual Satellite. The paper presents three different diagram types, explains their content and relevance for concurrent engineering sessions. It further mentions implementation details and the used technologies to include bidirectional graphical modeling editors in the Virtual Satellite software...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to refer to applicable documents in both programmatic and product-specification documents in contracted development. The practice permits inclusion of {{a vast amount of}} lessons-learned and best practices can be referenced without the need to include the information directly in the document, nor to maintain the referenced information. Product requirements documents often specify interfaces and interoperability characteristics by reference to <b>interface</b> <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> included in the list of applicable documents. Benefits accruing to the product from the use of applicable documents are reduced overall cost, better products and better interoperability.
