The AfDB project will contribute to developing a highly skilled labour force in biomedical sciences to meet the EAC’s immediate labour market needs and support implementation of EAC’s ‘free’ labour market protocols. One potential area for growth is medical tourism. The first phase of the AfDB project will support the creation of specialized centres of excellence in nephrology and urology in Kenya, cardiovascular medicine in Tanzania, biomedical engineering and e-health in Rwanda and oncology in Uganda. During the project’s second phase, a centre of excellence will open in Burundi in nutritional sciences. The East Africa Kidney Institute will operate as part of the University of Nairobi and its teaching hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital. The other centres of excellence will be established at the University of Rwanda’s College of Medicine and Health Sciences, the Uganda Cancer Institute and, in Tanzania, at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences. Some 140 master’s and 10 PhD students will benefit from the programme, as well as 300 interns. The centres of excellence will be expected to collaborate with internationally renowned establishments to develop quality curricula, joint research, promote interuniversity exchanges and mentoring programmes and to give access to <b>documentary</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
