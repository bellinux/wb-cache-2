Effect of using increasing number of sensors in the efficacy of predicting drill wear by using ANN has been studied.

40|$|Well 18 is a {{production}} {{well in the}} southern zone of Los Azufres geothermal field in México (see Figure 1). The well {{is located on the}} eastern <b>flank</b> of the <b>drilled</b> area, and produces a steam/water mixture from a depth of 1200 - 1250 m. A 19 hour pressure buildup test that was carried out in March 1986, {{is the subject of this}} paper. It is part of work reported by Sánchez-U. (1986) at the Geothermal Training Programme in Iceland. The permeability-thickness product of well 18 in Los Azufres field was determined 5. 4 dm from a Horner plot. The well was found to be intersected by a fracture, as evident from the slope on a log-log plot at early time, and a skin value of - 5. 3. The overall pressure buildup of the well was found to be typical for double-porosity reservoir behavior, having a storativity ratio of 0. 1.

40|$|Engineering {{problems}} often embody many {{characteristics of}} a multi-response optimization problem, and these responses are often conflicting in nature. To address this issue, the present work uses Grey- based Taguchi method to express surface roughness of drilled holes and <b>drill</b> <b>flank</b> wear into an equivalent single response grey relational grade. Experiments have been conducted in a radial drilling machine with five input parameters using L 27 orthogonal array. It has been observed that combined response of flank wear and surface roughness is affected by almost all input parameters; however, drill diameter is statistically most significant one whereas Spindle speed is least significant input parameter. The prediction results were obtained via. Mamdani fuzzy logic model and BPNN and the corresponding results were compared. It is observed that Mamdani produces better result compared to BPNN in predicting the equivalent response grey relational grade. The advantage of mamdani fuzzy logic {{lies in the fact}} that it can take into account the uncertainty and impreciseness involved during experimentation. It is usually convenient for the practitioners to express model inputs in linguistic terms such as high, low, medium rather than expressing in quantifiable terms. The extraction of linguistic terms can largely reduce the chances of error, which is a constriction experienced in case of crisp values used in neural networks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 University of Washington Abstract Experimental Study of Damage and Defect Detection during Drilling of CFRP Composites Eshetu Demissie Eneyew Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Ramulu Mamidala Department of Mechanical Engineering Rejection {{of parts}} at the {{assembly}} stage due to poor quality hole with drilling induced defect and damages, {{high rate of}} drill tool wear, {{and the formation of}} gaps when drilling stacks are major problems in the manufacturing of structural components from carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites. Interrupting the drilling process to inspect or monitor these problems during operation increases the cost of production and is a great economic challenge for industries; therefore, there is a great need for on-line monitoring method without interrupting the drilling process. This study will address these problems through various experimental investigations. Quality of holes and drilling induced damage and defects when drilling CFRP composites laminates were experimentally studied. The influence of drilling parameters, drilling conditions, and the type of surface plies on the resulting quality of the produced hole and on various drilling induced damage and defects were investigated. Drilling induced defects and damages such as drilled hole surface roughness, hole surface morphology, fiber pullout, and delamination were studied through qualitative measurements and SEM examination. In some cases a preliminary investigation on the use of acoustic emission and vibration signal for damage and defect detection was performed. Analytical models to predict the critical thrust force at the onset of exit ply delamination when drilling unidirectional CFRP composites was developed and proposed using an elliptical delamination zone with clamped boundary condition, and since the load applied by the drill tip is circular, the lateral uniform load is taken over a circular region rather than over an elliptical region. In addition to the analytical model, an experimental investigation was performed through a punch test on a blind hole to characterize the critical thrust force at the onset of exit ply delamination. The critical thrust force measured from the experimental investigation was compared with the results found by the newly developed analytical model. Comparison of experimentally measured values and predicted values by the new model developed in this study with predicted values of thrust force values at the onset of delamination by other models was presented. Based on this comparison, the predicted values by the new proposed model show better correlation with the experimentally measured values than values predicted by other models. An experimental investigation on online detection and monitoring of tool wear when drilling CFRP composite laminates was conducted utilizing different signal acquisition systems and signal analysis tools. Two new approaches namely, using the signal amplitude and using output variables from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) were proposed and studied in this investigation. Thrust force, vibration, acoustic emission, and audio microphone signals were acquired and the variation on the signals signature were studied and correlated to the progression of the <b>drill</b> <b>flank</b> wear. The amplitude of the thrust force and torque increased when flank wear increases, whereas, the amplitudes of acoustic emission and audio microphone signals decreased when flank wear increases. six out of eight of the output variables from the RQA increases with the increase of the <b>drill</b> <b>flank</b> wear, whereas, two of the output variables decrease with the increase of the <b>drill</b> <b>flank</b> wear in both cases of drilling conditions. In addition, a novel approach to detect the presence of a gap and to estimate the amount of the gap when drilling CFRP composite stacks through various signals was proposed in this investigation. Thrust force, acoustic emission, vibration, and audio microphone signals were acquired when drilling CFRP composite stacks. By introducing preexisting gap between the two plates before drilling, an estimation of the known preexisting gap was performed from the signal profiles. Thrust force signal shows high accuracy of estimating the preexisting gap with a maximum estimation error of 4. 17 % in both 0. 5 and 1 mm pre-existing gap, whereas, acoustic emission and vibration signal profiles found to be very close in both cases of gaps with an estimation error of 17 % and 5. 6 % for 0. 5 and 1 mm preexisting gaps respectively. Audio microphone signal delivers comparable estimation accuracy with an average estimation error of 8. 63 % and 6. 13 % for the preexisting gap of 0. 5 mm and 1 mm respectively...|$|R
40|$|With the {{continuing}} technology innovation, directional drilling technology {{has provided the}} coal mining industry with effective and practical options for pre- and post-drainage and exploration in Australia. In the past thirty years, in-mine borehole steering equipment has been developed from the single shot camera survey systems to the advanced Directional Drill Monitor utilizing Modular Electrically Connected Cable Assembly (DDM-MECCA) survey instruments, which provides rapid and easy underground borehole survey measurements whilst drilling. The presence of coal seam gas such as methane poses a significant safety hazard to underground coal mining all over the world. However, gas can be captured using pre- and post-drainage techniques to improve coal production, energy recovery, enhance safety, environmental mitigation. An additional benefit of directional drilling is geological explorations in advance of mining. As any discontinuities intercepted during in-seam directional drilling, such as faults, folds and igneous intrusions, can be monitored by drilling fluid pressures, changes in thrust, vibration, rate of penetration and inspection of cuttings. Directional drilling technologies offer coal operators a cost effective exploration alternative without speculation. Applications of the directional drilling technologies in Australian coal mines have established {{the benefits of the}} methodology for gas control and geological explorations. Directionally <b>drilled</b> <b>flank</b> boreholes provide shielding to the gate entry developments, horizontal goaf boreholes for gas drainage in deep multi-level mines, and hydro fracturing and exploration in advance of mining. However, there still remains four major problems associated with directionally drilling, and these include: sticky drilling in complex conditions, sensitivity of down hole probe, in-hole stability and drill depth capacity...|$|R
