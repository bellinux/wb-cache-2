5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting <b>for</b> <b>salmon,</b> remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E
5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. <b>For</b> <b>salmon,</b> the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the seasonal and diel movements of seaward-migrating juvenilePacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) passing John Day Dam on the Columbia River. Duringthe 1987 - 1989 and 19911993 seasons, the 10, 50, and 90 % passage dates each fell within a 2 -week period <b>for</b> yearling Chinook <b>salmon</b> (O. tshawytscha), steelhead (O. mykiss), coho salmon(O. kisutch), and sockeye <b>salmon</b> (O. nerka). <b>For</b> subyearling Chinook <b>salmon,</b> the 10 and 90 % passage dates varied {{by as much}} as 1 month, although the median passage dates occurredwithin a 10 -d period.

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers claimed {{they could hear}} the fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands <b>for</b> <b>salmon</b> in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing <b>for</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished <b>for</b> <b>salmon,</b> trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan <b>for</b> <b>salmon</b> recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat <b>for</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} interest and growth potential has emerged <b>for</b> Norwegian <b>salmon</b> in Iran’s seafood market. Willingness to pay (WTP) <b>for</b> Norwegian <b>salmon,</b> Iranian rainbow trout, and Iranian narrow-barred Spanish mackerel is estimated for seafood consumers in Iran. Marginal effects of taste, convenience, nutrition, and demographic factors on WTP, are also estimated. A survey among 359 food shoppers {{was conducted in}} Tehran province, employing a Multiple Price List (MPL) and a stated preferences method. Based on this survey, estimated WTP <b>for</b> Norwegian <b>salmon</b> is $ 12. 54, which is almost half of its current price in the market. The results indicate that WTP <b>for</b> Norwegian <b>salmon</b> is higher among high-income groups; and also taste, nutrition, and consumption frequency can increase this WTP up to $ 17. 45. This implies that businesses {{can take advantage of}} the existing opportunities <b>for</b> Norwegian <b>salmon</b> among Iranian seafood consumers by increasing their WTP and balancing the prices accordingly. Differentiating Norwegian salmon with respect to its attributes, and using local seafood stores in wealthy regions as the distribution channel, are the suggested strategies for development of the consumption of Norwegian salmon among Iranian seafood consumers...|$|R

5|$|The {{previous}} {{people of}} the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the Kalapuya, said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants, the Multnomahs, prior to European contact. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved {{from place to place}} in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded <b>for</b> <b>salmon</b> from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18thcentury with Europeans, who carried malaria, smallpox, measles, and other diseases. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west.|$|E
