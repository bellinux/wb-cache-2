5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story</b> arcs. Leyrado, who was 60 years old when the series was made, said that he was still active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences. Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was proud that his character did not conform to stereotypes of Asian people.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} Polish {{accounts of}} Morel's wartime activities however, differ substantially from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story.</b> According to the Institute of National Remembrance, {{at the beginning}} of 1942 Salomon Morel and his brother Izaak organised a criminal band to commit robberies in the surrounding villages. Their criminal activity ended when during one of their robberies they were captured by members of the Polish People's Army. To avoid punishment Morel placed the blame on his brother, and then joined the Soviet partisans in the Parczew area (see also Parczew partisans), where he worked as a janitor and a guide through the forests. His two brothers died during the war, one in 1943, another in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Robert d'Harcourt {{fought against}} {{prejudice}} {{in order to}} render the most objective image of Germany he could, whether positive or negative. Former prisoner Charles de Gaulle firmly believed that the countries’ populations lay {{at the base of}} Franco-German relations. These former prisoners allowed themselves to transcend their captivity and all it had engendered. However, such men were never designated as former prisoners of war per se. Prisoners appeared as men who should indirectly use their experiences in order to be recognised as a result. The status of prisoner was not one that was proclaimed proudly. It forced its owner to leave behind a part of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story</b> in order to allow another part of history to develop: the history of reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Haroun, Iff, Butt the Hoopoe, and Mali the stories' gardener, {{investigating}} the Sea's 'Old Zone', are captured by Khattam-Shud's animated shadow, {{who plans to}} plug the Story Source {{at the bottom of}} the Sea. Before he can do so, Mali destroys the machines used by him to poison the Sea, and Haroun restores the Sea's long-annulled alternation of night and day––– thus destroying the antagonist's shadow and those assisting him, and diverting the giant 'Plug' meant to seal the Source. In Chup, the Guppee army destroy the Chupwalas' army and release Princess Batcheat; whereupon Khattam-Shud himself is crushed beneath a collapsing statue commissioned by himself. Thereafter the Walrus promises Haroun a happy ending of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story.</b> On return to the human world, Rashid reveals Haroun's adventures to local citizens, who expel Snooty Buttoo.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Rosenblat and {{his wife}} had run into serious {{financial}} problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him. According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story,</b> replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it.|$|E

25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator {{tells the}} reader {{that he was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way of making sure the crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are shrugged off as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story,</b> he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was undeterred by the {{negative}} reactions; referring to Louis Lambert {{and the other}} works in Le Livre mystique, he wrote: [...] "Those are books that I create for myself {{and for a few}} others." [...] Although he was often critical of Balzac's work, French author Gustave Flaubert was influenced – perhaps unconsciously – by the book. <b>His</b> <b>own</b> <b>story</b> [...] "La Spirale", written in the 1850s, bears a strong plot resemblance to Balzac's 1832 novel.|$|E

In the 1846 edition, the character of Marcel has been changed to Marcas; but {{this may have been}} a printer's error. As Anthony Pugh explains: [...] "This detail is inexplicable; the principal character of Z. Marcas, who does not otherwise appear outside <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story,</b> seems a very unlikely candidate for the role. Could it be a misprint?" ...|$|E

500|$|After the Broadway {{successes of}} Welles's Mercury Theatre and the {{controversial}} 1938 radio broadcast [...] "The War of the Worlds" [...] on The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He {{signed a contract}} with RKO Pictures in 1939. Unusually for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>story,</b> to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane, collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the physical appearance of Tess, the team aimed {{to make her}} look [...] "tough and capable", striving to add an element of strength {{in order to show}} that she might be more ruthless than Joel.
