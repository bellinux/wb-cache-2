5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an <b>easy</b> <b>chair</b> and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E

25|$|I had the {{opportunity}} to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vydunas, Tumas-Vaižgantas, even Basanavičius, who was taken care of by my parents.

And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.|$|E
25|$|After the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, yawning {{with the}} pain of sitting on an <b>easy</b> <b>chair.</b> He does nothing at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural {{predator}} for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for Annio di Viterbo) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.|$|E

2500|$|One of his biographers, the {{historian}} William Hepworth Dixon, states: [...] "Bacon's {{influence in the}} modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a steam plough, sits in an <b>easy</b> <b>chair,</b> crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A trim, grim, vicious, and {{incredibly}} effective action movie with no cut comic-relief bit players, no winks at the audience, and no stars. Just a powder keg of a premise (lifted {{in part from}} Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo), in which a quasi-terrorist group's killing spree culminates in the action described in the title. Carpenter's mastery of wide-screen and almost uncanny talent at crafting suspense and action sequences make Assault such a nerve-racking experience {{that you may have}} to reupholster your <b>easy</b> <b>chair</b> after watching it at home." ...|$|E
