40|$|A {{number of}} light {{alcohols}} and other hydrocarbons {{were used in}} experiments to map their NOx reduction performance with a Ag-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Experiments were aimed at identification of compounds that could be candidates for fuel-borne reductants in a compression <b>ignition</b> <b>fuel,</b> or could be produced by some workable method of fuel reforming. A second goal was to improve understanding of reaction mechanisms and other phenomena that influence performance of this SCR system. Test results revealed that diesel engine exhaust NOx emissions can be reduced by more than 80 %, utilizing ethanol as the reductant for a space velocity near 50, 000 /h and catalyst temperatures between 330 and 490 oC.

40|$|Fusion energy due to {{inertial}} confinement has progressed {{in the last}} few decades. In order to increase energy efficiency in this method various designs have been presented. The standard scheme for direct ignition and fast <b>ignition</b> <b>fuel</b> targets are considered. Neutrons, electrons and photons transport in targets containing different combinations of Li and Be are calculated in both direct and fast ignition schemes. To compress spherical multilayer targets having fuel in the central part, they are irradiated by laser or heavy ion beams. Neutrons energy deposition in the target is considered using Monte Carlo method code MCNP. A significant amount of neutrons energy is deposited in the target which resulted in growing fusion reactions rates. It is found that Beryllium compared to Lithium is more important. In an introductory consideration of relativistic electron beam transport into central part of a fast ignition target, we have calculated electron energy deposition in highly dense D-T fuel and Beryllium layer of the target. It has been concluded that a fast ignition scheme is preferred to direct ignition because of the absence of hydrodynamic instability...|$|E
40|$|Air ingress with {{graphite}} burning {{belongs to}} the accident scenarios in HTRs with potentially severe consequences. This paper gives an overview of basic phenomena of graphite burning like ignition conditions and moving reaction fronts. The pioneering graphite burning experiments of Don Schweitzer are successfully reevaluated. Ignition conditions are examined, and it is underlined that burning depends not only on graphite properties {{but also on the}} heat balance in the whole graphite arrangement. In graphite-moderated reactors, ignition occurs at about 650 °C for small air flow rates: this means that normal operation temperatures in HTRs always allow for <b>ignition.</b> <b>Fuel</b> behaviour in air ingress, as determined in the KORA facility, is discussed: up to about 1300 °C modern TRISO fuel is stable in air, but from 1500 °C a complete, fast destruction is observed. Exemplary calculations on massive air ingress by chimney draught performed with REACT/THERMIX are outlined. For a hot bottom reflector there is a substantial time span before fuel is attacked. Because severe air ingress in well-designed HTRs belongs to beyond design basis accidents, the knowledge is fairly good.

40|$|Conventional diesel fuelled Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) engines {{have been}} {{investigated}} by many researchers previously. However, the ease of ignition and difficulty of vaporization of diesel fuel make it imperfect for PPCI combustion. In this study, Dieseline (blending of diesel and gasoline) was looked into as the Partially-Premixed Compression <b>Ignition</b> <b>fuel</b> for its combination of two fuel properties, ignition-delay-increasing characteristics and higher volatility, which make it more suitable for PPCI combustion compared to neat diesel. A series of tests were carried out on a Euro IV light-duty common-rail diesel engine, and different engine modes, from low speed/load to middle speed/load were all tested, under which fuel blend ratios, EGR rates, injection timings and quantities were varied. The emissions, fuel consumption and combustion stability of this dieseline-fuelled PPCI combustion were all investigated. The results showed that dieseline had great advantages as a PPCI combustion fuel in terms of emission reduction. This was particularly significant at high-speed engine mode. It was also found that with a blend of 50 % gasoline in diesel, the particle numbers total concentration could be reduced by 90 % while low NOx level and high brake fuel conversion efficiency (around 30 %) were maintained at all the loads tested. © 2011 SAE International...|$|E
