25|$|QM (quantum-mechanical) {{methods are}} very powerful. However, they are {{computationally}} expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained {{are not very}} accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the <b>good</b> <b>points</b> of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).|$|E

25|$|The player learns of the Pitt from a {{man named}} Wernher from a {{distress}} broadcast, who asks for the player's help in liberating the slaves there. The player has to enter the Pitt as a slave and work their way to freedom. This earns {{a meeting with the}} Pitt's leader, Lord Ashur, a former Brotherhood soldier left for dead during the Scourge. The player is given the choice of siding with either Wernher or Ashur. Unlike other decisions in Fallout 3, there is no karmic penalty or reward for choosing either side, as each side has both its <b>good</b> <b>points</b> and bad.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with manual typesetting, {{the problem of}} justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX, which, provided that <b>good</b> <b>points</b> for line breaking have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words {{to fill in the}} line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many line breaking algorithms use a first-fit approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it will have on the following lines. In comparison, the total-fit line breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.|$|E

VanOrd was less negative towards the characters and story than most others, but still described the characters as good, but not great. He felt the game focused too much on the less interesting characters of Noel and Serah over Lightning and Caius, and said that the story was [...] "semi-coherent" [...] and missed several emotional notes, particularly {{in the first half of}} the game.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's {{performance}} {{has also been}} praised. In 2004, ESPN released {{a list of the}} top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking his appearance at number 27. Sports Illustrated listed Johnson's cameo as the fifth best athlete guest appearance on The Simpsons. Meyers wrote that the episode [...] "makes a lot of <b>good</b> <b>points</b> about the public making heroes in a rash, hysterical manner," [...] and this point is made [...] "with an amusing cameo by Earvin 'Magic' Johnson". The San Diego Unions Fritz Quindt said the animators [...] "did [...] likeness good," [...] and noted that in the game the [...] "colors on the Lakers jerseys and the Forum court were correct. Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz were almost lifelike, announcing at courtside in Sunday-color-comics sweaters. And Chick's play-by-play was so real Stu couldn't get a word in." [...] Johnson's appearance was broadcast on CNN's Sports Tonight the day before the episode originally aired, and host Fred Hickman stated that he did not find it humorous.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} the Mana series, {{especially}} Secret of Mana, has received wide acclaim and fan enthusiasm. The Secret of Mana soundtrack {{was one of the}} first official soundtracks of video games music released in the United States and thus before fully mainstream interest in RPGs. The Secret of Manas opening theme, [...] "Angel's Fear", was rated at number 7 on IGN's Top Ten RPG Title tracks, calling it a [...] "magical title song that captures our hearts". It was also featured in the third Orchestral Game Concert. Secret of Mana is also the number 6 most remixed soundtrack on the popular video game music site OverClocked ReMix, with Seiken Densetsu 3 tied at 18. The {{music of the}} other titles have also been well received. RPGFan called the music to Final Fantasy Adventure [...] "addictive", despite its low, MIDI-like quality. GameSpy called Children of Manas music some of the best Nintendo DS music yet and referred to it as [...] "beautiful". Game Informer complimented Dawn of Manas music, calling it good. IGN referred to Legend of Manas music as [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated the background music brought [...] "intensity", [...] "suspense", and [...] "subtle nuance" [...] to the game. Other reviewers echoed similar praise with GameSpot calling it [...] "excellently orchestrated" [...] and RPGFan calling the music one of the game's <b>good</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Rugal's {{character has}} been positive. Japanese magazine Gamest ranked Rugal 48th {{on their list}} of the top 50 video game characters introduced in 1994, sharing the spot with Chang Koehan. Video games publications have commented on Rugal's character, adding praise and criticism. Retro Gamer praised the character, stating he [...] "rocks hard...harder than Street Fighters M. Bison". GameAxis Unwired compared Rugal with Street Fighters Akuma in regards to their significacies to their respective developers, with Rugal called the [...] "cheapest [...] in SNK's games." [...] 1UP.com praised the introduction of Omega Rugal in KOF '95, noting him to be [...] "one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history", although players could hate him due to {{how difficult it is}} to defeat him. However, they mentioned that one of the <b>good</b> <b>points</b> from KOF '96 was the absence of Rugal. Eurogamer reviewer Matt Edwards also commented that Rugal was very hard to defeat and that he started [...] "a trend in the KOF series of notoriously overpowered bosses who are hard to take down". IGN's Jeremy Dunhan praised Rugal, describing how his character developed the new rules for the King of Fighters tournament, and noted the difficulty in defeating Rugal himself. Listing him as one of the [...] "12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit", GamesRadar claimed that Rugal's difficult as a boss led gamers to coin the term [...] "SNK Boss syndrome." [...] In retrospective, Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely found Rugal and Orochi as difficult bosses but not as difficult as Krizalid from The King of Fighters '99. Den of Geek listed Rugal's upgraded form from Capcom vs. SNK 2 as the best altered character due to how it takes Akuma's special moves as well as other traits. The same site also listed him as the sixth best character from the KOF complimenting him as a good villain based on his traits. Complex listed him as one of the most challenging bosses in gaming, citing how overpowered were some of his moves most notably his [...] "Genocide Cutter". Despite criticizing most of the live-action movie based on the series, Derek Elley from Film Biz found Rugal's role enjoyable.|$|E

2500|$|In Fable, a player's Hero has {{a measure}} of good or evil {{alignment}} based on the Hero's actions. Good deeds award <b>good</b> <b>points,</b> which produce a positive alignment, while committing evil acts adds evil points, producing a negative alignment. Killing monsters or saving villagers are acts of good, whereas killing innocents, breaking laws, or abusing a spouse will accumulate evil points. Consuming certain foodstuffs can also affect the Hero's alignment; for example, eating tofu will earn the hero positive points, while eating crunchy chicks (because crunchy chicks {{are assumed to be}} still alive) will earn evil points. The player may also pray at the temples of Avo and Skorm. Donations to the Temple of Avo will result in <b>good</b> <b>points,</b> while [...] "gifts" [...] to the Chapel of Skorm will result in evil points. [...] The alignment affects not only the responses of non-player characters around the Hero, but also the appearance of the Hero himself. A Hero with a strongly positive alignment will feature a halo and a shaft of sparkling light above his head, butterflies fluttering around him and lighter features. An evil Hero emits a red haze from around his legs, draws flies, has glowing red eyes and grows horns.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne gave the album an A-.

[...] He criticized the game for bringing nothing new to the first-person shooter genre, and although he praised the storyline and the differentiation between the gameplay styles of Ray and Thomas, he was critical {{of the lack of}} a split-screen or online co-op mode; [...] "The lack of co-op is made all the more astounding when you take into account how great Bound in Bloods other multiplayer modes are."
