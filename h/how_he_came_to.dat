5|$|Sang Pencerah (The Enlightener) is a 2010 Indonesian film {{directed}} by Hanung Bramantyo and starring Lukman Sardi, Zaskia Adya Mecca, and Slamet Rahardjo. It is a biopic of Ahmad Dahlan which describes <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> found the Islamic organisation Muhammadiyah.|$|E
5|$|Two of the book's major {{topics are}} the strains in Blair's {{relationship}} with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's 1994 agreement {{to step down}} as Prime Minister much earlier, and his controversial decision {{to participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair discusses Labour's future after the 2010 general election, his relations with the Royal Family, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> respect President George W. Bush. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E

25|$|Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor – Gulavhar is a {{being from}} an earlier time that should have perished long ago - a winged demon with a hunger for blood. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> survive the terrible wars against Morgoth will never be known, yet survive he did, {{sleeping}} through countless centuries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it was a}} {{considerable}} success and saved a difficult – almost a desperate – situation. Another criticism of the play is that {{the form of the}} Sherlock Holmes short stories is missing. Holmes appears late in the narrative, while the ending is missing Holmes' explanations of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> his deductions – considered de rigueur among Holmes aficionados.|$|E
25|$|Hephaestus grows uglier {{and more}} violent with age. Thetis and Eurynome {{give him a}} hammer, anvil and forge to vent his fury and {{discover}} he is a gifted smith. Hephaestus' most beautiful creation is a brooch depicting a sea nymph and her lover; he threatens to destroy the brooch unless Thetis tells him {{who he is and}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> live in the grotto. The goddesses resume their tales: Rhea and Zeus conspire to overthrow Cronus. The avenging children of Cronus defeat and imprison the Titans, sparing Rhea, Prometheus and Epimetheus.|$|E

25|$|Semenov was a Transbaikalian Cossack – {{dark and}} thickset, {{and of the}} rather alert Mongolian type. His {{intelligence}} was of a specifically Cossack calibre, {{and he was an}} exemplary soldier, especially courageous when under the eye of his superior. He knew how to make himself popular with Cossacks and officers alike, but he had his weaknesses in a love of intrigue and indifference to the means by which he achieved his ends. Though capable and ingenious, he had received no education, and his outlook was narrow. I {{have never been able to}} understand <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> play a leading role.|$|E
25|$|His {{start in}} show business, like his early life, is also {{shrouded}} in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having {{been at the}} age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking cakewalk lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran {{as fast as he could}} up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|E
50|$|The film follows Hiccup and {{his young}} fellows {{accompanying}} their mentor, Gobber, on a quest to kill the legendary Boneknapper Dragon. About half the film is done in traditional animation, showing Gobber's history and his encounters with the Boneknapper, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> look like <b>he</b> does now.|$|R

500|$|The {{death of}} Edgar Allan Poe on October 7, 1849, has {{remained}} mysterious: the circumstances {{leading up to}} it are uncertain {{and the cause of}} death is disputed. On October 3, he was found delirious in Baltimore, Maryland, [...] "in great distress, and ... in need of immediate assistance", according to the man who found him, Joseph W. Walker. He was taken to the Washington College Hospital, where he died at 5 a.m. on Sunday, October 7. He was 40 years old. Poe was never coherent enough to explain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be in this condition.|$|E
500|$|Hanna was a {{supporter}} of building a canal across Central America to allow ships to pass between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans without making the lengthy journey around Cape Horn. [...] The senator believed a route across the Colombian province of Panama to be superior to its Nicaraguan rival. [...] <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> support this route is uncertain, though attorney and lobbyist William Nelson Cromwell later claimed to have personally converted Hanna to the Panama cause in 1901. [...] This was disputed by the French canal promoter, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who stated {{that at the end}} of his meeting with Hanna at the Arlington Hotel, the senator exclaimed, [...] "Monsieur Bunau-Varilla, you have convinced me." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 3, 1849, Poe {{was found}} delirious {{on the streets}} of Baltimore, [...] "in great distress, and... in need of {{immediate}} assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker who found him. He was taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning. Poe was never coherent long enough to explain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were [...] "Lord help my poor soul". All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.|$|E
500|$|Snodgrass's {{first-hand}} account describes Poe's {{appearance as}} [...] "repulsive", with unkempt hair, a haggard, unwashed face and [...] "lusterless and vacant" [...] eyes. His clothing, Snodgrass said, {{which included a}} dirty shirt but no vest and unpolished shoes, was worn and did not fit well. Dr. John Joseph Moran, who was Poe's attending physician, gives his own detailed account of Poe's appearance that day: [...] "a stained faded, old bombazine coat, pantaloons of a similar character, a pair of worn-out shoes run down at the heels, and an old straw hat". Poe was never coherent long enough to explain <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be in this condition, and it is believed the clothes he was wearing were not his own, not least because wearing shabby clothes was {{out of character for}} Poe.|$|E
500|$|At Blackheath, John Ball gave {{a famous}} sermon to the {{assembled}} Kentishmen. Ball was a well-known priest and radical preacher from Kent, who was by now {{closely associated with}} Tyler. Chroniclers' accounts vary as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{be involved in the}} revolt; he may have been released from Maidstone gaol by the crowds, or might have been already at liberty when the revolt broke out. Ball rhetorically asked the crowds [...] "When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then a gentleman?" [...] and promoted the rebel slogan [...] "With King Richard and the true commons of England". The phrases emphasised the rebel opposition to the continuation of serfdom and to the hierarchies of the Church and State that separated the subject from the King, while stressing that they were loyal to the monarchy and, unlike the King's advisers, were [...] "true" [...] to Richard. The rebels rejected proposals from the Bishop of Rochester that they should return home, and instead prepared to march on.|$|E

500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] became another remix {{in which}} Carey would feature a hip-hop artist, having done so {{several times in}} the past. Most notably, Carey began {{incorporating}} hip-hop and pop from her 1995 remix of her single [...] "Fantasy", which featured rap verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard (O.D.B.). The song was considered one of the pioneering songs that began the infusion of the [...] "thug-love duet". According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times, the song [...] "Nowadays clean-cut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers, but when Ms. Carey teamed up with Ol' Dirty Bastard, of the Wu-Tang Clan, for the 1995 hit 'Fantasy (Remix),' it was a surprise, and a smash." [...] Originally intended to feature only Jay-Z, the remix included rising rapper Young Jeezy, who considered the position the [...] "highest-profile guest appearance to date" [...] that he had been offered. In an interview with MTV News, Jeezy described <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be included on the remix: ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Litsey {{described}} the Joker {{as an example}} of a [...] "Nietzschean Superman", arguing that a fundamental aspect of Friedrich Nietzsche's Superman, the [...] "will to power", is exemplified in all of the Joker's actions, providing a master morality to Batman's slave morality. The character's indomitable [...] "will to power" [...] means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated and he is not restrained by guilt or remorse. Joker represents the master, who creates rules and defines them, who judges others without needing approval, and for whom something is good because it benefits him. He creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself, unlike Batman, the slave, who makes a distinction between good and evil, and is bound to rules outside of himself (such as his avoidance of killing), in his quest for justice. The Joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be, as like the Superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward.|$|E
500|$|In 1923 Formby {{started to}} play the ukulele, {{although}} the exact circumstances of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> play the instrument are unknown, and he introduced it into his act during {{a run at the}} Alhambra Theatre in Barnsley. When the songs—still his father's material—were well received, he changed his stage name to George Formby, and stopped using the John Willie character. Another significant event was his appearance in Castleford, West Yorkshire, where appearing on the same bill was Beryl Ingham, an Accrington-born champion clogdancer and actress who had won the All England Step Dancing title at the age of 11. Beryl, who had formed a dancing act with her sister, May, called [...] "The Two Violets", had a low opinion of Formby's act, and later said that [...] "if I'd had a bag of rotten tomatoes with me I'd have thrown them at him". Formby and Beryl entered into a relationship and married two years later, on 13 September 1924, at a register office in Wigan, with Formby's aunt and uncle as witnesses. Upon hearing the news, Eliza insisted on the couple having a church wedding, which followed two months later.|$|E
