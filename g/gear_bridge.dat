40|$|In a coaxial {{magnetic}} <b>gear,</b> <b>bridges</b> connecting separate {{pole pieces}} {{are useful for}} fabrication and also improve mechanical reliability. However, they have a negative influence on electromagnetic performance parameters such as transmission torque and iron loss. This paper investigates the effect of stationary pole pieces connected by bridges on the electromechanical characteristics. The bridge type and thickness are the main parameters influencing {{the performance of a}} coaxial magnetic gear. The inner, center, and outer bridge types each show the best performance in terms of different characteristics. However, for any bridge type, an increase in the bridge thickness reduces the overall electromagnetic performance, except for the torque ripple, and improves the over-all mechanical performance, including the deformation, von Mises stress, and natural frequency of the station-ary part...|$|R

Three methods of attaching acceleration sensors to differential gears: using screws, magnetic washers and probe handle. The results of comparisons of measurement results obtained using these methods.

However, FDF and Finnish Frontier Guard have their own Sissi (Finnish light infantry) training regiments (thousands in reserve) in which some hundreds of highly motivated volunteers, per year, are trained to operate behind enemy lines with asymmetric tactics and with light and some times improvised weapons. The role of the troops is reconnaissance, ambushes, to hit supply, logistics and command and control.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} in the Educational {{sector has}} immensely enhanced academic {{performance in the}} developed nations and the professional contributions may benefit the education strategy of Nigeria particularly in transforming the traditional education model to computer based virtual applications {{with a focus on}} e-pedagogy. Cloud computing remains a paradox and open to academic debate with respect to business adoption of its utility, and studies depict that cloud computing to an extent is still at its early incubation in institutions of higher learning; that also affirms the infancy of cloud computing in academia, and this has caused the dearth of a unified definition and understanding of cloud computing. However, this study will develop academic definition and meaning of cloud computing with reference to institutional applications This study will also explore the benefits of cloud computing in learning, and focus on the development of relevant models for resource usage in higher education institutions. Author shows that successful adoption of cloud computing by various educational institutions in Nigeria depends on their transition strategies in terms of resource acquisition and deployment. These strategies could form barriers in delivering effective teaching learning, and assessment of instruments encountered through migrating to the cloud. Hence this study is <b>geared</b> towards <b>bridging</b> the gap between the usage of cloud computing in education and effective delivery of educational services via the 2 ̆ 7 cloud 2 ̆ 7 in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Nigeria...|$|R

50|$|The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) had legal {{authority}} {{to approve the}} design and architectural style of the bridge. However, the United States Army Corps of Engineers had {{legal authority}} over the construction of public works in the District of Columbia. These two bodies agreed in late 1923 to construct a nine-span, 2,138 ft long drawbridge made of steel and reinforced concrete faced in white granite. The bridge required four abutments, one on each shoreline and one {{on either side of}} the draw (or bascule) span. The abutments had to be erected on bedrock. The bridge was relatively low to the water, which meant the roadway would be only 43 ft and the underside of each span just 10 ft above the low-water mark. The spans in the bridge sloped downward 12 ft, and all engines, <b>gears,</b> lookout stations, <b>bridge</b> tenders' houses, and other drawbridge equipment were as far out of sight below deck as possible. The spans varied in width from 166 ft near the shore to 184 ft at the draw span. The roadway was 60 ft in width, and sidewalks (each 15 ft in width) ran down each side of the bridge. A balustrade, 4276 ft long, was also planned. The balustrade was solid over the piers and abutments but turned spindles over the spans to permit maximum views of the river by motorists using the bridge.|$|R
40|$|Purpose This study explores Social Capital Theory. For {{the benefit}} of the {{business}} community it examines the role of social networking sites (SNS) in the accumulation and management of social capital for Black women entrepreneurs. This research project explores whether social media and technology have enabled a previously disadvantaged minority group to overcome their obstacles, particularly the lack of access networks that offer value. Significant research has been done on academic Social Capital Theory, but what remains understudied is the link between social capital and social networking sites, especially for minority and indigenous groups in Africa. The research is also applicable to other minority groups globally - adding value to Social Capital Theory {{in the context of a}} growing interest in knowledge economies, entrepreneurship and technology. The study makes a contribution to academic research and has implications for both policy and practice. Methodology The research is exploratory in nature and therefore applies a qualitative research methodology. It applies in-depth interviews with Black women entrepreneurs from different industries, and age groups to extract quality data that is analysed against theoretical propositions derived from the literature. Findings Bridging and bonding social capital are unique in how they empower entrepreneurs. Black women are a minority group because of cultural and historical consequences. As a result women are more disadvantaged than men, and minority women are more disadvantaged than white women. Negative stereotypes prejudice Black women from getting equal access to opportunities and resources. SNS, which is <b>geared</b> to accumulating <b>bridging</b> social capital, has the ability to empower Black women entrepreneurs to overcome these challenges. However, instead of using SNS for building bridging social capital - more essential for business growth - Black women entrepreneurs tend to use SNS to deepen bonding social capital which yields support and motivation. The potential value in SNS use should encourage Black women entrepreneurs to invest more resources in learning how to optimise SNS. Although SNS and government empowerment policies are contributing to equalizing access and use of social capital between different genders and races, men and the White business community still have an advantage. Future studies should consider exploring how generation theory and various social-economic issues affect accumulation and use of social capital through SNS use for minority groupsDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. zkgibs 2014 Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) MBAUnrestricte...|$|R
