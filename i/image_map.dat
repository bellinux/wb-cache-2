25|$|In HTML and XHTML, an <b>image</b> <b>map</b> {{is a list}} of {{coordinates}} {{relating to}} a specific image, created in order to hyperlink areas of the image to different destinations (as opposed to a normal image link, in which the entire area of the image links to a single destination). For example, a map of the world may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. The intention of an <b>image</b> <b>map</b> is to provide an easy way of linking various parts of an image without dividing the image into separate image files.|$|E

[...] Chang'e 2, beginning in October 2010, reached the Moon more quickly, mapped the Moon {{at a higher}} resolution over an eight-month period, then left lunar orbit for an extended stay at the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, before finally performing a flyby of asteroid 4179 Toutatis on 13 December 2012, and then heading off into deep space. On 14 December 2013, Chang'e 3 landed a lunar lander onto the Moon's surface, which in turn deployed a lunar rover, named Yutu (Chinese: 玉兔; literally [...] "Jade Rabbit"). [...] This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 in 1976, and the first lunar rover mission since Lunokhod 2 in 1973. China intends to launch another rover mission (Chang'e 4) before 2020, followed by a sample return mission (Chang'e 5) soon after.|$|E

2500|$|An anchor {{hyperlink}} is a link {{bound to}} {{a portion of}} a document—generally text, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (<b>image</b> <b>map</b> in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. [...] One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. [...] For example, a political map of Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel image {{transformation}} called Image Local Response (ILR) {{that can be}} used for solving complex <b>image</b> <b>mapping</b> problems. The proposed transformation brings together two approaches based on the pixel value distribution and image features. Image local response is defined as the average value of the difference between the transformed and the original copies of the same image whereby the transformation is small, i. e., the components of the corresponding parameter vector have sufficiently small unit values. The response has a few interesting properties useful in <b>image</b> <b>mapping.</b> The validity of the proposed image transformation is shown on sample complex <b>image</b> <b>mapping</b> problems formulated as the multi-objective piecewise imaging optimization problem...|$|R
