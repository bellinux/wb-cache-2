Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power (aside {{from being able to}} curl her tongue as shown in the episode [...] "Nuthin' Special").

500|$|... "Dirrty" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Christina Aguilera and rapper Redman for the former's fourth studio album Stripped (2002). Despite Aguilera's {{first three years of}} commercial success, she was displeased with the lack of control over her image. In response, she desired to create a song that would represent her authentic persona. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman's 2001 song [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Dirty</b> (I Can't Get in da Club)" [...] as a guide. The final result, [...] "Dirrty", is an R and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman. The song is about sexual activities.|$|E
500|$|Double Dare revitalized {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} a game show for children. Less than a year after the program launched, NBC had premiered I'm Telling!, Lorimar Television had announced plans for Fun House, and Nickelodeon's Finders Keepers began airingall shows based on competition between teams of children. During Double Dares first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including Hollywood Squares and The Cross-Wits were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that Double Dare [...] "allowed kids to <b>get</b> <b>dirty</b> {{and have a good time}} in ways that really were not acceptable before that show". Double Dare remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.|$|E

500|$|... "Dirrty" [...] {{was among}} the last tracks to be {{recorded}} for Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped. It was recorded at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank and Conway Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles by Oscar Ramirez, Wassim Zreik, and Dylan [...] "3-D" [...] Dresdow. Aguilera desired to create a [...] "down and dirty" [...] song that would announce her new image. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder, {{who had worked with}} her on [...] "Lady Marmalade", and suggested recording a song in the vein of Redman's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Dirty</b> (I Can't Get in da Club)". [...] "Dirrty" [...] ultimately became a [...] "near-remake" [...] of its predecessor, as Entertainment Weekly said. Rapper Redman, who previously appeared on Eminem's 2001 song [...] "Off the Wall", in which Eminem disses Aguilera, is featured on the song. Aguilera intended to use a misspelled title to personalize the song, also considering [...] "Dirtee" [...] or [...] "Dirrdy". The title reflects the music video, which Aguilera describes as [...] "gritty, [...] underground, illegal stuff going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Four years later, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] {{was added}} to the set list of the 2008-09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, where it was used as a video interlude. It {{featured}} Madonna as a boxer on screen, while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match, spraying her blood across the screen. Madonna's DJ Enferno remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down {{on the ground in the}} video, as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump-roping. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer's [...] "already-muscular arms", adding that [...] "nlike your run-of-the-mill diva, Madonna is willing to <b>get</b> <b>dirty</b> for her art, and she sometimes gets lost in her backup dancers' routine, though she's quick to remind the audience, 'I'm still the one in control'". Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that [...] "Die Another Day", along with the performances of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] are re-imagined as [...] "parts of larger medleys, with Madonna giving shout-outs to techno, flamenco and old-school R influences". This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "Loving Me 4 Me" [...] is a [...] "sultry" [...] classic R ballad. The {{follow-ups}} [...] "Impossible" [...] featuring Keys {{incorporates a}} piano theme, and [...] "Underappreciated" [...] {{talks about the}} pain of a break-up. The piano ballad [...] "Beautiful", which talks about the theme of self-respect, was deemed as the album's highlight by many critics, who praised its overall production. The next track [...] "Make Over" [...] is a salsa and dance-rock song that features a garage-rock beat. It was sued in the United Kingdom for illegally sampling the Sugababes' song [...] "Overload", The Guardian also noted similarities between the two songs. Later, the ASCAP organization had added the songwriting credits of Sugababes to the song. [...] "Cruz" [...] is a rock ballad that is musically similar to works of Michael Bolton. The two next tracks, [...] "Get Mine, Get Yours" [...] and [...] "Dirrty" [...] talk about the theme of sexual intercourse, and {{have been described as}} [...] "majestically filthy". The latter is the remake of Redman's [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Dirty</b> (I Can't Get in da Club)" [...] (2001), and also features the rapper. The follow-up is the interlude [...] "Stripped Pt. 2". The empowering ballad [...] "The Voice Within" [...] talks about trusting oneself. [...] "I'm OK" [...] is a ballad which incorporates strings and discusses Aguilera's abusive childhood with her father, and the final song from the album, [...] "Keep on Singin' My Song", incorporates elements from drum and bass with gospel choir.|$|E

60|$|But {{underneath}} the spick and span {{there is something}} more dreadful than the servitude of the servants. This dreadful thing is {{the philosophy of the}} spick and span. In Korea the national costume is white. Nobleman and coolie dress alike in white. It is hell on the women who do the washing, but there is more in it than that. The coolie cannot keep his white clothes clean. He toils and they <b>get</b> <b>dirty.</b> The dirty white of his costume is the token of his inferiority. The nobleman's dress is always spotless white. It means that he doesn't have to work. But it means, further, that somebody else has to work for him. His superiority is not based upon song-craft nor state-craft, upon the foot-races he has run nor the wrestlers he has thrown. His superiority is based upon the fact that he doesn't have to work, and that others are compelled to work for him. And so the Korean drone flaunts his clean white clothes, {{for the same reason that}} the Chinese flaunts his monstrous finger-nails, and the white man and woman flaunt the spick-and-spanness of their spotless houses.|$|E

60|$|The last {{preliminary}} to {{be noticed}} is the slowness with which the printer's ink hardens on the slab, and the rapidity with which it dries on paper. While serviceable for hours in the former case, in the latter it will be dry in a very few seconds. The drying or hardening of this oily ink has nothing whatever {{to do with the}} loss of moisture in the ordinary sense of the word, that is to say, of the loss of the contained water: it is wholly due to oxidisation of the oil. An extremely thin oxidised film soon forms {{on the surface of the}} layer on the slab, and this shields the lower-lying portions of the layer from the air, and retards further oxidisation. But paper is very unlike a polished slab; it is a fine felt, full of minute interstices. When a printed period (.) is placed under the microscope it looks like a drop of tar in the middle of a clean bird's-nest. The ink is minutely divided among the interstices of the paper, and a large surface being thereby exposed to the air, it oxidises at once, while a print from the finger upon glass will not dry for two or three days. One effect of oxidisation is to give a granulated appearance to the ink on rollers which have been allowed to <b>get</b> <b>dirty.</b> This granulation leaves clots on the slab which are fatal to good work: whenever they are seen, the roller must be cleaned at once.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has given}} me sincere {{pleasure}} to be here to-day, at the desire of your highly respected President and the Council of the College. In looking back upon my own past, I am sorry to say that I have found that it is {{a quarter of a century}} since I took part in those hopes and in those fears by which you have all recently been agitated, and which now are at an end. But, although so long a time has elapsed since I was moved by the same feelings, I beg leave to assure you that my sympathy with both victors and vanquished remains fresh--so fresh, indeed, that I could almost try to persuade myself that, after all, it cannot be so very long ago. My business during the last hour, however, has been to show that sympathy with one side only, and I assure you I have done my best to play my part heartily, and to rejoice in the success of those who have succeeded. Still, I should like to remind you at the end of it all, that success on an occasion of this kind, valuable and important as it is, is in reality only putting the foot upon one rung of the ladder which leads upwards; and that the rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher. I trust that you will all regard these successes as simply reminders that your next business is, having enjoyed the success of the day, no longer to look at that success, but to look forward to the next difficulty that is to be conquered. And now, having had so much to say to the successful candidates, you must forgive me if I add that a sort of undercurrent of sympathy has been going on in my mind all the time for those who have not been successful, for those valiant knights who have been overthrown in your tourney, and have not made their appearance in public. I trust that, in accordance with old custom, they, wounded and bleeding, have been carried off to their tents, to be carefully tended by the fairest of maidens; and in these days, when the chances are that every one of such maidens will be a qualified practitioner, I have no doubt that all the splinters will have been carefully extracted, and that they are now physically healed. But there may remain some little fragment of moral or intellectual discouragement, and therefore I will take the liberty to remark that your chairman to-day, if he occupied his proper place, would be among them. Your chairman, in virtue of his position, and for the brief hour that he occupies that position, is a person of importance; and it may be some consolation to those who have failed if I say, that the quarter of a century which I have been speaking of, takes me back to the time when I was up at the University of London, a candidate for honours in anatomy and physiology, and when I was exceedingly well beaten by my excellent friend Dr. Ransom, of Nottingham. There is a person here who recollects that circumstance very well. I refer to your venerated teacher and mine, Dr. Sharpey. He was at that time one of the examiners in anatomy and physiology, and you may be quite sure that, as he was one of the examiners, there remained not the smallest doubt in my mind of the propriety of his judgment, and I accepted my defeat with the most comfortable assurance that I had thoroughly well earned it. But, gentlemen, the competitor having been a worthy one, and the examination, a fair one, I cannot say that I found in that circumstance anything very discouraging. I said to myself, [...] "Never mind; what's the next thing to be done?" [...] And I found that policy of [...] "never minding" [...] and going on to the next thing to be done, to be the most important of all policies in the conduct of practical life. It does not matter how many tumbles you have in this life, so long as you do not <b>get</b> <b>dirty</b> when you tumble; it is only the people who have to stop to be washed and made clean, who must necessarily lose the race. And I can assure you that there is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures early in life. You learn that which is of inestimable importance--that there are a great many people in the world who are just as clever as you are. You learn to put your trust, by and by, in an economy and frugality of the exercise of your powers, both moral and intellectual; and you very soon find out, if you have not found it out before, that patience and tenacity of purpose are worth more than twice their weight of cleverness. In fact, if I were to go on discoursing on this subject, I should become almost eloquent in praise of non-success; but, lest so doing should seem, in any way, to wither well-earned laurels, I will turn from that topic, and ask you to accompany me in some considerations touching another subject which has a very profound interest for me, and which I think ought to have an equally profound interest for you.|$|E
