5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi <b>Investment</b> <b>Research</b> & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction spending in the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} spending in research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris. It has even been likened to the Tower of Babel.|$|E

The present study is an attempt to analyze the pattern and quantify the returns to <b>research</b> <b>investment</b> made over a period of 25 years on major field crops such as rice, jowar, finger millet (ragi), red gram, groundnut, sunflower, cotton and sugarcane in a predominantly agrarian state of Karnataka in peninsular India. The impact of <b>research</b> <b>investment</b> was assessed in terms of technology developed and growth in total factor productivity. The agricultural <b>research</b> <b>investment</b> had profound effect on the development of technologies relating to crop varieties, plant protection and crop management: dominant in cereals and associated with higher <b>research</b> <b>investments,</b> which is in tune with the national objective of achieving food security. Consequently, the rate of return to <b>research</b> <b>investment</b> is quite high in case of rice and sugarcane, moderate for finger millet, cotton and jowar, negative in red gram, groundnut and sunflower. The TFP growth is also higher in crops that attracted higher <b>research</b> <b>investments</b> due to growth in yield as a result of continuous upgradation of technologies.

25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal {{was a poor}} one.

Dumoulin-Smith pointed out that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, EPA is likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).|$|E
