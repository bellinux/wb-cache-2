50|$|Formerly {{known as}} Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation, KITCO Ltd {{was set up}} in 1972 to speed up the {{industrialisation}} process in the state of Kerala. It was with initiative of IDBI and Kerala Government that the organisation was established. The success of KITCO experiment later prompted the central government to set up similar TCOs in many other states also. That was how APTICO (Andhra Pradesh), ITCOT (Tamil Nadu), MITCON (Maharashtra), NITCON (Punjab), GTCO (Gujarat) etc. came into being. The company with headquarters at Kochi, Kerala, is considered as a Central public Sector Organisation with 85% share holding by Central Sector Institutions and is subjected to Govt. audit. Today, 49% of the shares of the company are held by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). Chairman and managing director (CMD) is the Chief Executive and a board of directors nominated by the shareholders advises the CMD in policy matters. KITCO was established primarily to assist public sector banks operating in Kerala state to assess the proposals to start small scale industries, submitted to the Bank with a view to get financial assistance. In the initial years, the organisation studied the project reports, prepared feasibility reports for the banks and also prepared project reports for new entrepreneurs.Over the years, the environment and market in which KITCO operated underwent material changes. The overall industrial climate in the state had passed through many vicissitudes; the new entrepreneurs, many of whom had the benefit of training of EDPs conducted by KITCO, developed the competence to make their own project reports acceptable to banks; and banks had further strengthened their own <b>internal</b> <b>competence</b> to identify and appraise the viability of projects. On its part, the state government had also begun to look for professional support from KITCO for larger projects/assignments. Overall, these developments helped facilitate a qualitative shift in the status of KITCO, from the level of consultants for SMEs to that of a multi-functional and multi-disciplinary organisation offering a wide range of services to the industrial and infrastructure sector, and to a wider spectrum of clientele including those outside the geographic boundaries of Kerala.|$|E

Potential opportunities and implications for consulting organisations and SD practitioners are examined. The paper describes the convergence of SD and recent strands of resource-based strategic management thinking, broadly classified here as "value thinking", for which SD can undoubtedly provide unique support. A suitable support methodology is described and named "Value Chain Dynamics" (VCD). Building on good SD practice, VCD is a project-based approach that establishes the interdependence of SD and value thinking as a means to assess the value implications of all kinds of change. The utility of the method is illustrated by reference to its potential to support business development and value initiatives within the business consulting industry.

Reliance on <b>internal</b> <b>competence,</b> lack of trust to other firms and fear of losing economic benefits to others are among the reasons.

40|$|This {{issue is}} {{the outcome of a}} {{workshop}} on "Governance of Migration in the EU: Home Affairs or External Policy?" organised at the European University Institute on 19 October 2012. Article 79 TFEU contains competences of the European Union to regulate immigration {{as an integral part of}} the area of freedom, security and justice. Under this purely <b>internal</b> <b>competence,</b> the Union should establish a common immigration policy aimed at the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals and fight against illegal immigration. Over the past decade, the Union has adopted a number of directives under this <b>internal</b> <b>competence.</b> Yet, both prior to the introduction of an explicit Union power to regulate immigration and currently in parallel with this power, the Union and Member States implement immigration policy externally via international agreements with third states and more subtle policy tools. The purpose of this workshop is to break with the conventional understanding of immigration as an internal policy of the Union and to look at EU’s immigration policy form the outside, discussing immigration as an external, as opposed to internal, policy of the Union. The contributors test the external component of immigration as a tool in market integration, trade liberalization, development, foreign policy and promotion of mobility. The underlying assumption is that the nature of the policy, objectives, powers and instruments may differ and conflict with each other depending on whether immigration policy is shaped internally or externally. The presentations offer a multidisciplinary analysis of the role of migration governance in the EU and the role of the Union in migration governance globally. -KOCHAROV, Anna - Governance of migration in the EU : home affairs or foreign policy?, pp. 239 – 243 -JACOBSSON, Johanna - Liberalisation of service mobility in the EU's international trade agreements : as external as it gets, pp. 245 – 261 -GARCÍA ANDRADE, Paula - The legal feasibility of the EU’s External Action on legal migration : the internal and the external intertwined, pp. 263 – 281 -PAPAGIANNI, Georgia - Forging an External EU Migration Policy: From Externalisation of Border Management to a Comprehensive Policy?, pp. 283 – 299 -KORNEEV, Oleg - EU migration governance in Central Asia : everybody’s business – nobody’s business?, pp. 301 – 318 -MC NAMARA, Frank - Member State responsibility for migration control within third states : externalisation revisited, pp. 319 – 33...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the trade-off between leveraging external sources of innovation by outsourcing design and engineering {{activities and the}} ability to develop <b>internal</b> product development <b>competences.</b> The trade-off arises because the division of labor within and across firms' boundaries has a crucial role in shaping competence development processes, especially because the division of labor also influences opportunities for learning by doing. In new product development projects, learning by doing appears to be both a key determinant of competence development and a difficult-to-substitute form of learning. While the division of development tasks is often considered as guided by product architecture, we show that by decoupling the decisions concerning the product architecture and the allocation of development tasks, firms can realize the benefits of outsourcing such tasks while developing new <b>internal</b> <b>competences.</b> Drawing on a longitudinal case study in the automotive industry, we also identify a new organizational lever for shaping competence development paths and for designing firm boundaries. This lever consists in alternating different task allocation schemes over time for different types of development projects. We show why this is a novel solution, what its underlying logic is, and how it enables alleviating the trade-off between the benefits of leveraging external sources of innovation and the opportunities for competence development provided by in-house design and engineering. We discuss implications for theories of organizational boundary design and innovation management. innovation management; organizational boundaries; outsourcing; product architecture; modularity; new product development; template process; automotive industry; Fiat...|$|R

30|$|Collaborating with {{different}} types of partners on R&D represents knowledge network diversity or diverse sources of knowledge. Network diversity facilitates innovative process by enabling firms to create novel associations and linkages [42]. It raises the likelihood of achieving product innovation due to the amount and variety of knowledge that is shared [5, 43]. In particular, many researchers {{have focused on the}} relationship between the diversity of the network and product innovation. Recent works suggest that using a wide range of external actors and sources should help a firm to achieve and sustain product innovation [2]. However, manufacturing SMEs are not fully capable of identifying and evaluating new knowledge owing to resource constraints; thus, they are poor in their use of external information. This lack of information and the small scale of the firm result in SMEs having low negotiation power [14]. Moreover, many manufacturing SMEs’ information search activities are likely to be prohibitively costly or misdirected due to the absence of functional specialists or a lack of high and broad levels of <b>internal</b> <b>competence</b> [9, 11]. We study whether external network diversity influences product innovation in manufacturing SMEs even with these constraints.|$|E
