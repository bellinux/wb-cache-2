25|$|Due {{to limited}} disclosure, {{studying}} the returns to private equity is relatively difficult. Unlike mutual funds, {{private equity funds}} need not disclose performance data.

40|$|In a {{frictionless}} world, <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> perfectly elastic {{to changes}} in the discount rate.

Equivalently, <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> a more powerful predictor of future stock returns. Consistent with this prediction, we document that the asset growth, external finance, and accrual anomalies in the cross-section of stock returns are much stronger in financially more constrained firms than in financially less constrained firms. Further tests show that this effect of financial constraints is distinct from the effect of financial distress and the effect of limits of arbitrage on the magnitude of the anomalies. ...|$|R

The difference is attributed to government subsidies to poor regions. The relationship between personal saving and private <b>investment</b> <b>is</b> insignificant in the U.
