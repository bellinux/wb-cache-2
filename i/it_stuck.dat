5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E

A quarter-mile cable was {{attached}} between the Challenger and an explosives-laden 1967 Chevrolet Camaro with the motor and transmission removed. The tow vehicle was driven by Loftin, who pulled the Camaro into the blades of the bulldozers at high speed. Loftin expected the car to go end over end, but instead <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> into the bulldozers, which he thought looked better.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{was born}} in Scotland, Maryland, in Saint Mary's County, the sixth of 17 {{children}} born to sharecroppers Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub where the children were bathed. Smith says he tried to shake the moniker several times, but <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> incessantly. He recalls that a 10th grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames {{was the last person}} to call him by his proper name, Orlando.|$|E

25|$|After Henry Cow disbanded in 1978, Cutler created Recommended Records in London, an {{independent}} label and distribution network for RIO artists. The record label quickly filled the gap left by commercial labels and {{soon began to}} also release non-RIO bands and musicians. Recommended Records's aim was to produce records of high technical and musical quality, placing the musicians' interests first and profits second. This strategy, however, led to the label experiencing financial difficulties from time to time, but <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> to its principles and has survived for over 25 years.

25|$|At 1400 hrs on 3 December a South African Air Force Lockheed Ventura coastal patrol {{aircraft}} was sent from Cape Town to drop supplies {{on the beach}} for the survivors. At about 1620 hrs the pilot, Captain Immins Naude, found the beach. His crew dropped the supplies but most were destroyed on impact. Naude landed on a nearby flat piece of land {{with the intention of}} rescuing some of the remaining survivors on the beach. Unfortunately the land was a salt pan disguised by desert sand. The next day it was discovered that the Ventura's undercarriage had sunk through the crusted surface of the salt, damaging the aircraft and leaving <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> in the sand.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} stated by Reno that their name was chosen {{due to a}} dream by Paul Dean. He {{had come up with}} the name after {{spending}} the previous night with some of the bandmates, including Reno and their girlfriends, before going to the movies. The girlfriends were browsing through fashion magazines, where the guys in the band saw a Cover Girl advertisement. Cover Girl became Cover Boy, and then became Loverboy in Dean's dream later that night. After being told by Dean about the dream the next morning, Reno agreed to try it out and <b>it</b> <b>stuck.</b> The group made its live debut opening for Kiss at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C. on November 19, 1979.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

500|$|Three {{days before}} the day the bomb was to be test detonated in the New Mexico desert, Bacher {{was part of the}} pit {{assembly}} team, which assembled the nuclear capsule (a cylindrical section of the uranium tamper, containing the plutonium core and initiator) in an old farmhouse near the Alamogordo testing site. When the capsule was driven to the shot tower and inserted into the spherical tamper, inside the explosive assembly, <b>it</b> <b>stuck.</b> [...] Bacher recognized that expansion of the capsule due to the heat given off by the plutonium core was causing the jam, and that leaving the two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow the capsule to be inserted fully. After watching the test, his reaction was merely [...] "Well, it works." ...|$|E
500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, saw that a few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished his meal. [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> to his beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, and ate it. [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E
500|$|At {{the tower}} a {{temporary}} eyebolt was screwed into the [...] capsule, and a chain hoist {{was used to}} lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered {{the hole in the}} uranium tamper, <b>it</b> <b>stuck.</b> Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.|$|E

500|$|Byard {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts. At that time, his parents – John Sr and Geraldine Garr – were living at 47 Clayton Street. Both of his parents played musical instruments; his mother played the piano, as did his uncles and grandmother, the last playing in cinemas during the silent film era. He began piano lessons {{at the age of}} six, but they ended when his family was {{affected}} by the Great Depression. He was also given a trumpet that belonged to his father, and attempted to copy the popular players of the time, Roy Eldridge and Walter Fuller. As a boy he often walked to Lake Quinsigamond to listen to bands performing there. He heard Benny Goodman, Lucky Millinder, Fats Waller, and Chick Webb, and listened to other bands of the era on the radio. [...] "Those were the things that inspired me – I guess <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> with me", he commented decades later.|$|E
500|$|Ringo Starr {{identified}} {{his initial}} inspiration for [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as having come from Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist with English glam rock band T. Rex. In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, Starr described Bolan as [...] "a dear friend {{who used to}} come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang-out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon". Over dinner one evening at Starr's home outside London, Bolan had used the word [...] "boogaloo" [...] so often that <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998, Starr explained: [...] " [...] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo... ooh you, boogaloo.' 'Do you want some potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'" [...] Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children's toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song.|$|E

500|$|Pelé {{was born}} on 23 October 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American {{inventor}} Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the [...] "i" [...] and call him [...] "Edson", {{but there was a}} mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as [...] "Edison", not [...] "Edson", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed [...] "Dico" [...] by his family. He received the nickname [...] "Pelé" [...] during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more <b>it</b> <b>stuck.</b> In his autobiography, Pelé stated {{he had no idea what}} the name means, nor did his old friends.

500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist. Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that <b>it</b> <b>stuck</b> with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E
