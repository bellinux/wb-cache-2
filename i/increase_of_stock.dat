40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a survey conducted to test the hypothesis that the use <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer could lead to increased production on dairy farms in South Taranaki. Increases in stocking rates and fertilizer rates had been taking place on some farms in the South Taranaki area for several seasons preceding the 1961 - 62 season. Farmers making these increases suggested that other management changes were necessary when <b>increased</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer were used. These changes, when taken together, were thought to lead to increases in production. Thus the specific aim of the survey was to find a well proven management system incorporating <b>increased</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and fertilizer, and to evaluate this system in physical and financial terms. No attempt was made to find the best management system for increasing production since this attempt would have been defeated by the important differences between farms and between farmers. Rather, the aim was to fully document one management system so that the uncertainty associated with its adoption by farmers would be reduced. Should farmers feel that there are management systems superior to the one evaluated in this study, then it is to be hoped that a demand for further research will arise. [From Introduction...|$|R
