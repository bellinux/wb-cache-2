5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats.

However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites {{at the end of}} Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural communities that provided Gedi with most of its agricultural produce.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public <b>goods</b> <b>for</b> the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
