25|$|Based {{upon the}} size of the Earth and the force of gravity on its surface, the average density of the planet Earth is 5.515g/cm3, and typical densities of surface rocks are only half that (about 2.75g/cm3). If any {{significant}} portion of the Earth were hollow, the average density would be much lower than that of surface rocks. The only way for Earth to have the force of gravity that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> for much more dense material to make up {{a large part of the}} interior. Nickel-iron alloy under the conditions expected in a non-hollow Earth would have densities ranging from about 10 to 13g/cm3, which brings the average density of Earth to its observed value.|$|E

25|$|Ozone, {{along with}} {{reactive}} forms of oxygen such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite ions, is naturally produced by {{white blood cells}} and other biological systems (such as the roots of marigolds) {{as a means of}} destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of trioxidane from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.|$|E

[...] Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. [...] One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as [...] "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. [...] Project Jupiter was initially slated to be {{a new version of the}} Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. [...] Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. [...] According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, [...] "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. [...] If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. [...] If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. [...] But if the only thing <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> double the colors...." [...] Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. [...] One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. [...] This would come in the form of an add-on. [...] From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed [...] "Project Mars", was advanced.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{argument}} {{is something of a}} straw man argument as very few proponents of the rule argue from Latin in any case. Certainly, it is clear that dislike of the split infinitive does not originate from Latin. As shown above, none of the prescriptivists who started the split-infinitive controversy in the 19th century mentioned Latin in connection with it. Occasionally teachers and bloggers can be found who do oppose the split infinitive with such an argument, but it is not found in any statements of the position from the 19th or early 20th century, when the prohibition developed. Of the writers cited here (and the many others consulted) who ascribe the split-infinitive prohibition to Latinism, none cite an authority who condemned the construction on that basis.
