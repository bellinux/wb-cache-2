5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just <b>inside</b> <b>ring</b> 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E
25|$|On 28 December 1914 the Sagene Line was {{extended}} via Bentse Bridge to Torshov, where it intersected with the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. This allowed KSS {{to start a}} circle service, which it named Sagene Ring and numbered 0. It initially used white signs for the counter-clockwise <b>inside</b> <b>ring</b> and green signs fort he clockwise outer circle. Thus the service would run along the Sagene Line and then connect down along the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. The headway was set to five minutes, which required eight trams per direction. At Sagene they took a five-minute break, {{and as long as}} they were on time passengers could transfer to the next tram and save the break.|$|E

50|$|Christiania grew {{faster than}} most European cities around 1870-1890. Property {{developers}} built houses and villas while the city provided roads, water and sanitation. Owing to fire regulations the building material was brick, {{and this is}} largely the area that today is <b>inside</b> <b>Ring</b> 2 (the bypass road 2). Several new parks were created, {{most of them in}} the eastern part of the city. The argument giving priority to the eastern part was that it was the most crowded part of the city and was thus most in need of parks.|$|E
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{compass rose}} appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes true cardinal directions while the smaller <b>inside</b> <b>ring</b> denotes magnetic cardinal directions. True north {{refers to the}} geographical location of the north pole while magnetic north refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a compass) will point. The angular difference between true and magnetic north is called variation, which varies depending on location. The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is called deviation which varies by vessel and its heading.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of a peripheral cue represented by a gray ring on responsivity to a subsequent target varies. When a vertical line <b>inside</b> a <b>ring</b> was a go target and a white small <b>ring</b> <b>inside</b> a <b>ring</b> was a no-go target, reaction time was shorter at the same location relative to a different location. However, no reaction time {{difference between the two}} locations occurred when a white cross <b>inside</b> the <b>ring,</b> instead of the white vertical line <b>inside</b> the <b>ring,</b> was the go target. We investigated whether this last finding was due to a forward masking {{influence of}} the cue, a requirement of low attention for the discrimination or a lack of attention mobilization by the cue. In Experiment 1, the intensity of the cue was reduced in an attempt to reduce forward masking. In Experiment 2, the vertical line and the cross were presented in the same block of trials so as to be dealt with a common attentional strategy. In Experiments 3 and 4, the no-go target was a 45 º rotated cross <b>inside</b> a <b>ring</b> to increase the difficulty of the discrimination. No evidence was obtained that the cross was forward masked by the cue nor that it demanded less attention to be discriminated from the small ring. There was a facilitation of responsivity by the cue when the small ring was replaced by the rotated cross. The results suggest that when the discrimination to be performed is too easy the cue does not mobilize attention...|$|R

This wicked agent may be {{even more}} lethal on the ground than in the air...and you'd better believe he's plenty lethal in the air. A master of {{disguise}} and duplicity, Cutthroat is a constantly dreaded yet grudgingly respected threat to Ring Raider security. He pilots the Bayonet, a customized F19A stealth fighter. In a dogfight, he's likely to show up almost anywhere with little or no warning. Whether he's striking <b>inside</b> <b>Ring</b> Raider headquarters, or at 55,000 feet, Cutthroat's favorite attack is the classic knife-in-the-back ambush. Cutthroat did not appear in the toy line.|$|E

A number are dedicated as the Sovereigns' Arches, with corbels sculpted into depictions of Canada's monarchs; the latest addition being that of Queen Elizabeth II, unveiled on 9 December 2010.

50|$|Circular stone {{features}} {{were found in}} the site. These stones could have served many different functions, yet the most common function was the use of circular stones to anchor the perimeters of habitation structures. This is a common Colorado feature, particularly in the plains and foothills. Several artifacts were also found throughout the site. In Ring 1, charcoal flecks and two fragmentary deer-sized long bones were uncovered. Also, high concentrations of tiny pebbles were found, which suggest that a living room was located above Ring 1. Ring 3 consisted of a central hearth with rocks and charcoal. <b>Inside</b> <b>Ring</b> 4, two small pottery pieces were uncovered. Reassembled these pieces formed a single sherd roughly the size of a thumbnail. Most of the artifacts uncovered at the site were found in close proximity to Rings 4 and 5. These included flakes, a projectile point tip, and a snub-nosed scraper with spokeshave/drawknife concavities on both lateral edges. Throughout the entire site, a total of 60 flakes, one fragmentary projectile point, one fragmentary biface, a whole scraper/spokeshave, and a small ceramic sherd were discovered during excavations.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{different}} aspects {{in the process of}} sound design, "Arts" and "Science". In my opinion, the sound design should engage both aspects strongly and in interaction with each other. I started the process of designing the sound for GOLDEN BOY by building the city soundscape of New York City in 1937. The scenic design for this piece is designed in the round, putting the audience all around the stage; this gave me a great opportunity to use surround and specialization techniques to transform the space into a different sonic world. My specialization design is composed of two subsystems [...] one is the four (4) speakers center cluster diffusing towards the four (4) sections of audience, and the other is the four (4) speakers on the four (4) corners of the theatre. The outside ring provides rich sound source localization and the <b>inside</b> <b>ring</b> provides more support for control of the specialization details. In my design four (4) lavalier microphones are hung under the center iron cage from the four (4) corners of the stage. Each microphone is ten (10) feet above the stage. The signal for each microphone is sent to the two (2) center speakers in the cluster diagonally opposite the microphone. With the appropriate level adjustment of the microphones, the audience will not notice the amplification of the voices; however, through my specialization system, the presence and location of the voices of all actors are preserved for all audiences clearly. With such vocal reinforcements provided by the microphones, I no longer need to worry about overwhelming the dialogue on stage by the underscoring. A successful sound system design should not only provide a functional system, but also take the responsibility of bringing actors' voices to the audience and engaging the audience with the world that we create on stage. By designing a system which reinforces the actors' voices {{while at the same time}} providing control over localization of movement of sound effects, I was able not only to make the text present and clear for the audiences, but also to support the storyline strongly through my composed music, environmental soundscapes, and underscoring...|$|E
