40|$|We have {{investigated}} the unique role of the insulin receptor (IR) and the balance of its isoforms A and B in the regulation of apoptosis in simian virus 40 (SV 40) -immortalized neonatal hepatocytes. Immortalized hepatocytes lacking (HIR KO) or expressing the entire IR (HIR LoxP), and cells expressing either IRA (HIR RecA) or IRB (HIR RecB) have been generated. IR deficiency in hepatocytes increases sensitivity to the withdrawal of growth factors, because these cells display an increase in reactive oxygen species, a decrease in Bcl-x L, a rapid accumulation of nuclear Foxo 1, and up-regulation of Bim. These events resulted in acceleration of caspase- 3 activation, DNA laddering, and cell death. The single expression of either IRA or IRB produced a stronger apoptotic phenotype. In these cells, protein complexes containing IRA or IRB and Fas/Fas-associating protein with death domain activated caspase- 8, and, ultimately, caspase- 3. In hepatocytes expressing IRA, Bid cleavage and cytochrome C release were increased whereas direct activation of caspase- 3 by caspase- 8 and a more rapid apoptotic process occurred in hepatocytes expressing IRB. Conversely, coexpression of <b>IRA</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRB</b> in IR-deficient hepatocytes rescued from apoptosis. Our results suggest that balance alteration of <b>IRA</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRB</b> {{may serve as a}} ligand-independent apoptotic trigger in hepatocytes, which may regulate liver development...|$|E

Four short inversions associated with short palindromic sequences that form stem-loop structures were also observed in the chloroplast genome of P. schinseng {{compared to that of}} Nicotiana tabacum. The genome content and the relative positions of 114 genes (75 peptide-encoding genes, 30 tRNA genes, 4 rRNA genes, and 5 conserved open reading frames [ycfs]), however, are identical with the chloroplast DNA of N. tabacum. Sixteen genes contain one intron while two genes have two introns.

Eighteen simple sequence repeats have been identified from the chloroplast genome of Korean ginseng. Several of these SSR loci show infra-specific variations. A detailed comparison of 17 known completed chloroplast genomes from the vascular plants allowed the identification of evolutionary modes of coding segments and intron sequences, as well as the evaluation of the phylogenetic utilities of chloroplast genes.

Relative to other plant cp genomes, the L. japonica cp genome had a unique rearrangement between trnI-CAU and trnN-GUU. In L. japonica cpDNA, rps 19, rpl 2, and rpl 23 move to the LSC region, from the IR region. The ycf 1 pesudogene in the IR region is lost, and only one copy locates in the SSC region. Comparative cp DNA sequence analyses of L. japonica with other cp genomes reveal that the gene order, and the gene and intron contents, are slightly different.

The P. edulis chloroplast genome is characterized by the presence of two copies of an inverted repeat sequence (<b>IRA</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRB)</b> of 26, 154 bp, each separating a small single copy region of 13, 378 bp and a large single copy (LSC) region of 85, 720 bp.

Also, 36 repetitive elements and 85 SSRs (microsatellites) were identified. The structure of the complete cp genome of P. edulis differs from that of other species because of rearrangement events detected by means of a comparison based on 22 members of the Malpighiales. The rearrangements were three inversions of 46, 151, 3, 765 and 1, 631 bp, located in the LSC region. Phylogenomic analysis resulted in strongly supported trees, but this could also be a consequence of the limited taxonomic sampling used.

40|$|Abstract Background The melon {{belongs to}} the Cucurbitaceae family, whose {{economic}} importance among vegetable crops {{is second only to}} Solanaceae. The melon has a small genome size (454 Mb), which makes it suitable for molecular and genetic studies. Despite similar nuclear and chloroplast genome sizes, cucurbits show great variation when their mitochondrial genomes are compared. The melon possesses the largest plant mitochondrial genome, as much as eight times larger than that of other cucurbits. Results The nucleotide sequences of the melon chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were determined. The chloroplast genome (156, 017 bp) included 132 genes, with 98 single-copy genes dispersed between the small (SSC) and large (LSC) single-copy regions and 17 duplicated genes in the inverted repeat regions (<b>IRa</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRb).</b> A comparison of the cucumber and melon chloroplast genomes showed differences in only approximately 5 % of nucleotides, mainly due to short indels and SNPs. Additionally, 2. 74 Mb of mitochondrial sequence, accounting for 95 % of the estimated mitochondrial genome size, were assembled into five scaffolds and four additional unscaffolded contigs. An 84 % of the mitochondrial genome is contained in a single scaffold. The gene-coding region accounted for 1. 7 % (45, 926 bp) of the total sequence, including 51 protein-coding genes, 4 conserved ORFs, 3 rRNA genes and 24 tRNA genes. Despite the differences observed in the mitochondrial genome sizes of cucurbit species, Citrullus lanatus (379 kb), Cucurbita pepo (983 kb) and Cucumis melo (2, 740 kb) share 120 kb of sequence, including the predicted protein-coding regions. Nevertheless, melon contained a high number of repetitive sequences and a high content of DNA of nuclear origin, which represented 42 % and 47 % of the total sequence, respectively. Conclusions Whereas the size and gene organisation of chloroplast genomes are similar among the cucurbit species, mitochondrial genomes show a wide variety of sizes, with a non-conserved structure both in gene number and organisation, {{as well as in the}} features of the noncoding DNA. The transfer of nuclear DNA to the melon mitochondrial genome and the high proportion of repetitive DNA appear to explain the size of the largest mitochondrial genome reported so far. </p...|$|E

High-throughput sequencing of chloroplast (cp) genomes enhanced the understanding about evolutionary relationships within plant families. In this study, we determined the complete cp genome sequences for A. sinensis. The size of the A. sinensis cp genome was 159, 565 bp. This genome included a large single-copy region of 87, 482 bp, a small single-copy region of 19, 857 bp, {{and a pair of}} inverted repeats (<b>IRa</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRb)</b> of 26, 113 bp each. The GC content of the genome was 37. 11 %. The A. sinensis cp genome encoded 113 functional genes, including 82 protein-coding genes, 27 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes. Seven genes were duplicated in the protein-coding genes, whereas 11 genes were duplicated in the RNA genes. A total of 45 polymorphic simple-sequence repeat loci and 60 pairs of large repeats were identified. Most simple-sequence repeats were located in the noncoding sections of the large single-copy/small single-copy region and exhibited high A/T content. Moreover, 33 pairs of large repeat sequences were located in the protein-coding genes, whereas 27 pairs were located in the intergenic regions. Aquilaria sinensis cp genome bias ended with A/T on the basis of codon usage. The distribution of codon usage in A. sinensis cp genome was most similar to that in the Gonystylus bancanus cp genome. Comparative results of 82 protein-coding genes from 29 species of cp genomes demonstrated that A. sinensis was a sister species to G. bancanus within the Malvales order. Aquilaria sinensis cp genome presented the highest sequence similarity of > 90 % with the G. bancanus cp genome by using CGView Comparison Tool. This finding strongly supports the placement of A. sinensis as a sister to G. bancanus within the Malvales order. The complete A. sinensis cp genome information will be highly beneficial for further studies on this traditional medicinal plant. Moreover, the results will enhance our understanding about the evolution of cp genomes of the Malvales order, particularly with regard to the role of A. sinensis in plant systematics and evolution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGaining {{the full}} {{activity}} of the insulin receptor (IR) requires the proteolytic cleavage of its proform by intra-Golgi furin-like activity. In mammalian cells, IR is expressed as two isoforms (<b>IRB</b> <b>and</b> <b>IRA)</b> {{that are responsible for}} insulin action. However, only IRA transmits the growth-promoting and mitogenic effects of insulin-like growth factor 2. Here we demonstrate that the two IR isoforms are similarly cleaved by furin, but when this furin-dependent maturation is inefficient, IR proforms move to the cell surface where the proprotein convertase PACE 4 selectively supports IRB maturation. Therefore, in situations of impaired furin activity, the proteolytic maturation of IRB is greater than that of <b>IRA,</b> <b>and</b> accordingly, the amount of phosphorylated IRB is also greater than that of IRA. We highlight the ability of a particular proprotein convertase inhibitor to effectively reduce the maturation of <b>IRA</b> <b>and</b> its associated mitogenic signaling without altering the signals emanating from IRB. In conclusion, the selective PACE 4 -dependent maturation of IRB occurs when furin activity is reduced; accordingly, the pharmacological inhibition of furin reduces <b>IRA</b> maturation <b>and</b> its mitogenic potential without altering the insulin effects...|$|R
