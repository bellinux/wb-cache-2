5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events of these years is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> that ceratosaurians {{underwent}} BDR {{independent of}} the tetanurans, and therefore has no bearing {{on the issue of}} avian digit homology. In particular, as demonstrated by teratological analysis, the abbreviation (mesomelia) and loss of digits (hypophalangia) in the forelimb of Limusaurus is likely the result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout the evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians, and is unconnected to the pattern of digital reduction and frameshift that occurred in tetanurans. This is supported by the hands of the ceratosaurians Ceratosaurus, Berberosaurus, and Eoabelisaurus having plesiomorphic (i.e. more similar to the ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs) metacarpal bones comparable to those of the more basal theropod Dilophosaurus. The divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function; tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping, while the hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played no role in predation.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} the crusades were a {{response}} to Islam dates {{back as far as}} 12th-century historian William of Tyre, who began his chronicle with the fall of Jerusalem to Umar. Although the original Islamic conquests had taken place centuries before the First Crusade, more recent events, or atrocities, committed by the Muslims in their occupation of the Levant, would have been fresh {{in the minds of the}} European Christians of the time. For example, in 1009 the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been destroyed by the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah; Pope Sergius IV supposedly called for a military expedition in response, and in France, many Jewish communities were even attacked in a misdirected retaliation. Despite the Church's rebuilding after al-Hakim's death, and pilgrimages resuming, including the Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–1065, pilgrims continued to suffer attacks from local Muslims. Liberating the Sepulchre is often presented as motivation for the crusaders. In addition, the even more recent Turkish incursions into Anatolia and northern Syria were certainly viewed as devastating by Eastern Christian chroniclers, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> they were presented as such by the Byzantines to the Pope in order to solicit the aid of European Christians.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} stated by critics of evolution {{that there are}} no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight.|$|E
25|$|Boyer moves {{outside the}} leading {{currents}} in mainstream cognitive psychology {{and suggests that}} we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

Given that as of 2013 a large amount of TLS traffic uses RC4 to avoid recent attacks on block ciphers that use cipher block chaining, if these hypothetical better attacks exist, then this would make the TLS-with-RC4 combination insecure against such attackers in a large number of practical scenarios.|$|E

25|$|In the {{introductory}} section, it was claimed that M-Theory allows to learn invariant representations.

Because templates may be totally unrelated to images that the system later will try to classify, memories of these visual experiences may serve as a basis for recognizing many different kinds of objects in later life. However, as it is shown later, for some kinds of transformations, specific templates are needed.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{holy water}} in the {{earliest}} days of Christianity is attested to only in somewhat later documents.

Yet, in many cases, the water used for the Sacrament of Baptism was flowing water, sea or river water, and it could not receive the same blessing as that contained in the baptisteries {{in the view of the}} Roman Catholic church. However, Eastern Orthodox do perform the same blessing, whether in a baptistry or an outdoor body of water.|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} Roman army amassed {{against the}} rebels was much larger than that {{commanded}} by Titus sixty years earlier - by that time nearly {{one third of the}} Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba.

Legio XXII Deiotariana was likely entirely lost during an earlier stage of the revolt. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> that Legio IX Hispana also arrived in Judea and its demise occurred during the decisive campaign of Sextus Julius Severus, as Legio IX Hispana's disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.|$|E
25|$|None of the group-13 {{elements}} {{has a major}} biological role {{in complex}} animals, but some are at least associated with a living being. As in other groups, the lighter elements usually have more biological roles than the heavier. The heaviest ones are toxic, as are the other elements in the same periods. Boron is essential in most plants, whose cells use it for such purposes as strengthening cell walls. It is found in humans, certainly as a trace element, but there is ongoing debate over its significance in human nutrition. Boron's chemistry does allow it to form complexes with such important molecules as carbohydrates, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>plausible</b> {{that it could be}} of greater use in the human body than previously thought. Boron has also been shown to be able to replace iron in some of its functions, particularly in the healing of wounds. Aluminium has no known biological role in plants or animals. Gallium is not essential for the human body, but its relation to iron(III) allows it to become bound to proteins that transport and store iron. Gallium can also stimulate metabolism. Indium and its heavier homologues have no biological role, although indium salts in small doses, like gallium, can stimulate metabolism.|$|E
