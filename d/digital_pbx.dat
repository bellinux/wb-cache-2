50|$|The {{next major}} product {{was a large}} <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to {{integrate}} the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.|$|E
50|$|Stromberg {{created the}} DBX-1344/5136, the first fully <b>digital</b> <b>PBX.</b> It used a LSI/PDP-11 {{microprocessor}} {{in the early}} models. The product line was sold many times and eventually was employee purchased. The new company, Digital Voice Corp, added the DBX-288 & Excalibur lines and grew up to over 32,000 ports & 128,000 directories in the Excalibur.|$|E
50|$|Digital lines {{cannot be}} {{recorded}} unless the call recording system can capture and decode the proprietary digital signalling, which some modern systems can. Sometimes a method is supplied with a <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> that can process the proprietary signal (usually a conversion box) before being channeled {{to a computer}} for recording. Alternatively a hardware adapter {{can be used on}} a telephone handset as the digital signal is converted at that point to analogue.|$|E

50|$|DPNSS was {{developed}} in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product 'Megastream' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. <b>Digital</b> (PCM-based) <b>PBXs</b> were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, 'CAS' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.The support for DPNSS as BT's own signaling protocol also differentiated BT's private circuit’s services from those of its emerging rival Mercury Communications.DPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT & Plessey) but quickly snowballed with MITEL, GEC, Ericsson, Philips and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.BT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and CCITT (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of Q931 and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.There were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the ANSI standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.Version 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with ISDN features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS 'APNSS' {{was developed}} using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a modem to support D channel signalling.|$|R
50|$|BNR {{was based}} at the Carling Campus in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with campuses at {{locations}} around the world, including Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; and Maidenhead, United Kingdom. Bell-Northern Research pioneered the development of digital technology, and created the first practical <b>digital</b> <b>PBX,</b> (SL1), and central office (DMS). Under the direction of then Nortel Chief Officer, John Roth, BNR lost its separate identity in the 1990s, and was folded into the Nortel R&D organization.|$|E
50|$|The Meridian Norstar, {{later called}} Nortel Norstar was a small-office <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> {{introduced}} by Northern Telecom (now Avaya). It {{is based on}} the same internal design and instruction set as Nortel's earlier SL-1 and DMS systems, allowing it to support features such as integrated voice messaging (Meridian Mail), automatic call distribution and other features, but can support a total of up to 192 phones and has limited processing power. In the United Kingdom it is sold by British Telecom, rebadged as the BT Norstar.|$|E
50|$|It was {{introduced}} by Northern Telecom in December 1975, with an original capacity from 100 to 7,600 lines, {{and became the first}} fully <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> announced on the global market aimed at the smaller PBX market. In the early 1970s, most PBXs were either electromechanical (e.g. cross-bar) or based on a hybrid technology (e.g. switching matrix made from a two-dimensional array of contacts but control performed by an electronic logic). For this reason, the SL-1 enjoyed a great success on the enterprise market both in North-America and globally.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Lucent Technologies {{introduced}} the Merlin Magix as the {{replacement for the}} Merlin Legend. The Magix's carrier was metal and, as such, modules were not encased inside plastic shells as they were with the Legend. The Merlin Magix supported new 4400 series digital telephones as well as older MLX telephones, {{but it did not}} support the old ATL series telephones. One important item with the conversion of Legend to Magix, is how MLX telephones used 2-pair wiring and the newer Magix/4400 series phones only used a single (1) pair. This made the Magix easier to install and more competitive in the marketplace, as most other <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> systems only used a single (1) pair to each station/telephone.|$|E
50|$|ROLM {{originally}} made flight {{computers for}} the military and heavy commercial industries such as oil exploration (Halliburton). Beginning in the early 1970s, International Paper Company bought {{a significant number of}} the 1602 series computers. These became the environmentally-hardened base for that company's in-house-developed process control system, which informally became known as the dual-ROLM. Later, in an attempt at diversification, ROLM themselves branched off into energy management by buying a company producing an early version of such a system and the telecom industry by designing the CBX, internally running a 1603 computer. It quickly outsold AT&T, who at the time had not come out with a <b>digital</b> <b>PBX,</b> and became #2 behind the Nortel SL-1 switch by 1980. At one point, ROLM was poised to overtake Nortel as the leader in PBX sales in North America.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s, Stromberg {{developed}} what {{is arguably}} the first fully <b>digital</b> <b>PBX,</b> the DBX. The first DBX was installed at Export, Pennsylvania in 1977 and consisted of 960 ports. While this first field trial had limited success, Stromberg went on to develop the DBX-240, DBX-1200 and the DBX-5000. Also during this same period, Stromberg developed a number of leading edge technologies and products, including the first digital AUTOVON switching system and the first digital Command and Control communications system. By 1980 General Dynamics was undergoing a significant change and in 1982, General Dynamics sold the Stromberg-Carlson operations in several parts. The Stromberg key-systems was sold to ComDial, the PBX/DBX division was sold to United Technologies and the Central Office division was sold to Plessey of the UK. Plessey eventually sold [...] "Stromberg Carlson," [...] the DCO business unit, to Siemens AG in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|ROLM Corporation, {{founded in}} 1969 by Gene Richeson, Ken Oshman, Walter Loewenstern and Robert Maxfield, {{was the first}} PBX {{manufacturer}} to offer integrated voice-mail with its PhoneMail system, its registered trademark. PhoneMail offered impressive recording quality of its digitized messages. ROLM's <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> (called a CBX, for Computerized Branch eXchange) {{was the first to}} enable PhoneMail to illuminate a message waiting light on ROLM phones equipped with message waiting lights (also a stutter dialtone is used with analog and digital phones). Rolm was sold to IBM, who later sold it to Siemens who offer PhoneMail in various configurations/sizes (including a micro-sized version) and its unified messaging successor, Xpressions 470. ROLM was purchased by IBM in the mid 1980s (which was a financial disaster for the profitable ROLM, as IBM clearly could not grasp the laid back, [...] "think outside the box" [...] attitude of ROLM, which was the #2 PBX supplier in the US from the mid 70s to late 80s), then sold half interest to the German company Siemens. In 1992, Siemens bought ROLM entirely from IBM and the original ROLM product line was done for, except for PhoneMail (the only product Siemens did not destroy). VMX suffered from poor product and ineffective management and was about to fold when Opcom merged with it. The surviving company was called VMX, but VMX was all but erased by Opcom except for its name and patent portfolio.|$|E
5000|$|Sam Pitroda hired on at Wescom Inc around 1974, and {{developed}} some early digital switching technology.The '580" [...] name represented the 5 functional areas or frames {{of the original}} [...] "Large PBX (lpbx)" [...] design. They were the Line, Trunk, Network, Service and Control frames. The [...] "80" [...] represented the 1980s decade which was quickly approaching while Wescom was developing its first commercial <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> during the 1975 to 1980 time period. The 580L PBX {{was the first of}} the 580 family of products from Wescom.In addition to an Intel 8080 CPU complex, the heart of the 580 was the digital network frame which implemented a 64 kb time-division multiplexing digital network as the basic switching fabric of the 580 DSS. The first product in the family was the 3072 timeslot 580L-PBX which had a set of six Intel 8080 microprocessor pairs, for handling individual tasks in its control complex (State, Database, Console, Register, Trunk and Line micro complexes(CPU, memory, IPBs). Each of these actually consisted of redundant processor cards, and each micro card had dual 8080 chips using hardware matching between two 8080 chips. Faults detected on any of the online micros would automatically switch to its standby copy. Intercommunication between the various micros was loaded into the appropriate software queues and sent via the hardware Interprocessor buffers (IBPs). The 580L, M and S systems also incorporated a standby Network block which could switch seamlessly into operation without dropping existing calls if a Network fault was detected. The network blocks used memory locations to contain voice data. In smaller sized systems the tasks were combined in fewer physical processors. This led to the term [...] "monogeneric" [...] software and hardware for the various sized systems.|$|E
40|$|The digital voice/data PBX {{is finally}} {{reaching}} it 2 ̆ 7 s anticipated potential {{and becoming a}} major factor when considering the total communications picture for many businesses today. The <b>digital</b> <b>PBX</b> {{has always been the}} choice for voice communications but has lagged behind the LAN industry when it comes to data transfers. The pendulum has begun to swing with the enhanced data capabilities of third and fourth generation PBXs. The battle for the total communication market is quite fierce between the LAN and PBX vendors now. This research thesis looks at the history, evolution, and architecture of voice/data PBXs. It traces development of PBXs through the present fourth generation architectures. From the first manual switches introduced in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s through the Strowger switch, step-by-step switching, stored program control, common control, digital switches, dual bus architectures, and finally what is anticipated in the future. A detailed description of of the new fourth generation dual bus architectures is presented. Lastly, speculations on the future direction PBX architectures will take is explored. A description of the mechanics of a possible Wave Division PBX is presented based on a fiber optic transport system...|$|E
