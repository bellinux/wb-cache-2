Nixon and his staff were offered {{a key role in}} the redesigning of the plane, a position they took up, and indeed, the <b>finished</b> <b>plane</b> reflected the new president's persona. The interior of the plane was stripped from the nose to the tail; all minor problems were taken care of; upgrades were made on the flight management system; communications gear was slightly modified. Richard Nixon had the interior of the plane redesigned to suit his fancy. Nixon did away with the open floor plan of the Johnson era and replaced it with a three-room suite for himself and his family, serving as a combination of lounge, office, and bedrooms. Accommodations for guests, aides, security and media personnel were located aft of the three rooms.|$|R
40|$|Tailored blanks {{play in the}} {{bodywork}} {{an important}} role for the light weight construction of vehicles. Up to now available tailored blanks consist of sheet steel and have a different thickness or mechanical strength. For body parts without a necessary stability the vibrational behaviour is of importance. Therefore the material - aluminium - is very suitable. There are tailored blanks made of aluminium and steel. At the moment they only can be produced in an overlapping form by laser welding. But in this case there is the danger of building of an intergranular zone (hard and brittle), which would impede the following conversion. The introduced aluminium-steel-tailored blank is a semi <b>finished</b> <b>plane</b> sheet, that is prepared by rolling of the initial material. Considering the knowledge of cold press welding of aluminium and steel {{there will be no}} building of intergranular zones during the production of aluminium-steel-tailored blanks.

2500|$|On 1 December 1916, {{events had}} progressed {{to the point}} of the War Office {{formally}} requesting technical data from the motor company. Ball visited the Austin works that month. He recommended arming the plane with two Lewis guns mounted on the centre section, and firing above the plane's propeller; however, this arrangement was replaced by an installation patented by Herbert Austin, in which a Vickers machine gun fed by a 500-round belt of ammunition fired through a hollow propeller shaft, (A Lewis gun seems to have been actually mounted in this position in the prototype as completed). A supplementary Lewis gun stocked with four 97-round magazines was in the event mounted on the centre section. He also added a note {{at the end of the}} specifications sheet, dated 8 December 1916, that the <b>finished</b> <b>plane</b> should have [...] "neutral flying characteristics". An internal memo critiqued the proposed design, with an eye toward its fitness for production. It was noted that, in an attempt to lower the plane's weight and thus increase its performance, it would only carry fuel enough for two hours running at full throttle. The relatively high design wing loading of 7 pounds per square foot might increase speed, but decrease manoeuvrability. Mounting of the engine exhaust pipes alongside the cockpit would hinder downward view, (In the event shorter exhausts were fitted, that discharged forward and downwards). The A.F.B.1's [...] "vaguely Germanic" [...] appearance was also criticised. An endorsement atop the memo noted that Ball was to see Sefton Brancker.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Magnetic {{abrasive}} finishing (MAF) {{is a kind}} of {{method for}} polishing the surfaces and the edges. The investigation for the technique of MAF and the development of the ferromagnetic poles lay a theoretical foundation for developing a new method for finishing the curved surfaces automatically under the numerical control. In the paper, the performance parameters of the developed magneto poles, which are used for <b>finishing</b> the <b>plane</b> surfaces and the curved ones, have been tested. The curvature of the finished surface, the sloping angle of the machined surface and the rotation speed of the poles, which affect the surface roughness, are studied theoretically. What mentioned above supply references to the practical uses of the MAF, especially in the mould manufacturing...|$|R

5000|$|The sculptures {{that made}} her {{significant}} {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. Fabricated from wood and painted with monochromatic layers of acrylic, they often resemble sleek, rectangular columns or pillars. Truitt produces in scale drawings of her structures that are then produced by a cabinetmaker. The structures are weighed to the ground and are often hollow, allowing the wood to breathe in changing temperatures. She applies gesso to prime the wood and then up to 40 coats of acrylic paint, alternating brushstrokes between horizontal and vertical directions and sanding between layers. The artist sought to remove any trace of her brush, sanding down each layer of paint between applications and creating perfectly <b>finished</b> <b>planes</b> of colour. [...] The layers of paint build up a surface with tangible depth. Additionally, the palpable surface of paint convey Truitt's ever-present sense of geography in the alternating vertical and horizontal paint strokes that mirror the latitude and longitude of an environment. Her process combined [...] "the immediacy of intuition, the remove of prefabrication, and the intimacy of laborious handwork." [...] The recessional platform under her sculpture raised them just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, for instance, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color. The Arundel series of paintings, begun in 1973, features barely visible graphite lines and accumulations of white paint on white surfaces. In the custard-color Ice Blink (1989), a tiny sliver of red {{at the bottom of the}} painting is enough to set up perspectival depth, as is a single bar of purple at the bottom of the otherwise sky-blue Memory (1981). Begun around 2001, the Piths, canvases with deliberately frayed edges and covered in thick black strokes of paint, indicate Truitt’s interest in forms that blur the lines between two and three dimensions.|$|R

30|$|Examples of {{the impact}} of sunk costs on {{decision-making}} appear not only in corporate decision-making but in everyday decisions as well. For example, imagine that you bought a ticket for a play at your local theater. A couple of days later, a good friend calls and invites you to a special Italian dinner the evening of the play. Although you would prefer to attend the dinner, your thoughts revolve around the sunk cost of the already-paid-for theater ticket, and you decide to attend the play. Examples {{of the impact}} of sunk costs on corporate decisions include R&D investments, such as the development of the supersonic plane Concorde. Already in early development stages, the plane was significantly more expensive than expected, and the financial success of the project was unclear. However, the project was not stopped, and new funds were allocated to <b>finish</b> the <b>plane</b> {{on the grounds that the}} large amount of money that has already been invested should not have been wasted (Arkes and Ayton 1999, p. 591).|$|R
30|$|Thirty green square lumbers of Sugi (115  ×  115  ×  3000  mm 3) were {{obtained}} from Ehime Prefecture in Japan.

Homeland Security spokesperson Brian Doyle later claimed that Alpizar [...] "threatened that he had a bomb in his backpack" [...] and [...] "made a move toward the backpack". Ignoring requests to stop, Alpizar continued to exit the plane and was soon confronted just outside the aircraft in the jetway. After being ordered to the ground, Alpizar allegedly did not comply, instead reaching for the bag. The two Air Marshals pulled out their [...]357 SIG Sauer pistols and opened fire, killing Alpizar. Conflicting reports put the number of shots between three and nine.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Planing and moulding operations carried out within the woodworking industry make an extensive use of rotary machining. Cuttermarks are produced on the timber surface, which are generally accepted as unavoidable. More noticeable surface defects may be produced by such factors as cutterhead imbalance, and until recently most research has concentrated on removing these defects. When a high quality finish is required, a further machining operation, such as sanding, is often required to remove cuttermarks. What is required is a modified machining process, which combines a surface closer to the ideal fixed knife finish, while retaining the flexibility, practicality and cost effectiveness of rotary machining. It has been theorized that the surface <b>finish</b> of <b>planed</b> and moulded timber products may be improved by introducing vertical cutterhead pulses. This thesis concerns the progress made towards the modification of the rotary machining process to improve surface form for planed timber components. Thus simulation of the rotary machining process is described, allowing {{an evaluation of the}} surface form quality produced by the modified machining process, and allowing a comparison to be made between the effectiveness of new machining process and conventional rotary machining. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed machining method, a small-scale planer with an actuation system using piezoelectric actuators to control the spindle movement was designed. An electrical model of the piezoelectric actuators was combined with a finite element model of the spindle to create an overall model used for simulation. The modelling technique used represents significant progress in the field of mechatronic system modelling, and a useful tool for designing active spindle systems...|$|R

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1912 the cutting of timber in the Chinquapin area was started and logs were hauled to Merced Falls. The Yosemite Valley Railroad {{was built to}} carry out the lumber {{harvested}} from the vast supply of Sugar Pines found along the Merced River canyon. Immortalized in author Hank Johnston’s book, “Whistles Blow No More”http://www.yosemitevalleyrr.com/modeling.htm, the Yosemite Lumber Company logged in this area. In fact, the remains of the longest Incline rail system ever built are located at what is now Camp One Resort http://www.anamericanadventure.com/history.html, just a short distance away from the Yosemite West development. The incline rose to a height of 3,100 feet (950 m) above the Merced River. The Camp One incline was used to lower logs to the Merced River at El Portal from the logging area. One of the stops on the Yosemite Valley Railroad line was the lumber mill built by the Yosemite Lumber Company where the wood was <b>planed,</b> <b>finished,</b> dried and stored. The lumber company is gone now and trees have fully returned with most 80+ feet (24+ m) tall, surrounding most homes on the hill. The old Shay logging train grades have been replaced with paved roads and underground utilities, giving it a pleasant rural atmosphere.|$|R
30|$|In fact, {{there are}} {{a good number of}} {{publications}} focusing on the quantitative benefits of the PPP model. 75  % of the British PPP projects have reached and even beyond the requirements in terms of price and quality, and saved 17  % costs.

Chile is one leading country using the PPP model to develop public services. Among the whole 36 PPP projects since 1994, 24 ones were used to develop transport infrastructure. The annual investment ranges from 0.3 to 1.7 billion US dollar. By reviewing international publications in the field of transport PPP projects (Alfen et al. 2009; Infrastructure Partnerships Australia 2007; Liyanage and Villalba-Romero 2015; Tamayo et al. 2014; Tsamboulas et al. 2013; U.S. Department of Transportation 2007), it is found that the following features of PPP model are popular: construction period (75  %), facility quality (flat), service price (90  %), service level (excellent). In order to test the validity of PPP strategy in FN-YRD, the aforementioned parameters of PPP model are taken as input for simulation model. The traditional investment model is used as a reference. Their features are as follows: construction period (100  %), facility quality (rough), service price (100  %), service level (normal).|$|R
40|$|Designing and {{building}} Dos Hermanas cycle track Roof {{was considered a}} fi rst magnitude achievement for several reasons: fi rst for their many great dimensions in plan, second for avoiding any contact with the existent old building, and third because the interest in make a simple piece not surprising for its spectacularity. In fact it is a building that surprise for the wide inner space more than for the external form. Another important goal was that the entire roof must be supported by only four legs, as a table. Never mind if the dimension of these legs were great because we could convert them in sculptural pieces. And the lat question was that for us {{it was very important}} not to exhibit triangulated girders but only a surface hanging from height to the top of columns, bringing forces in a natural way.

Se buscaba hacer un edificio modesto a pesar de su dimensi&# 243;n. De hecho es un edificio que sobrecoge por su espacialidad interior m&# 225;s que por su apariencia externa.
