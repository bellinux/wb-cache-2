60|$|The {{smile on}} the Serjeant's countenance became more defined; <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> <b>his</b> leg with {{increased}} violence; and, throwing himself {{back in his}} easy-chair, coughed dubiously.|$|R
6000|$|Conrad sank upon a {{bench and}} covered his face with <b>his</b> hands while <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> <b>his</b> body to and fro and moaned. The {{stranger}} {{said in a low}} voice to the servant: ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> on <b>his</b> wings, {{his feet}} {{gathered}} up under him, and waited.|$|R
60|$|And then, as Dave's torch gave a final flicker {{and went}} out, our hero saw {{a shaft of}} light move over the <b>rocks</b> above <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Rather lazily {{the crab}} {{rose to the}} surface and caught hold of a bit of <b>rock.</b> With <b>his</b> <b>head</b> above the water he said in a cross voice: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} he stood beside his friend, who {{had risen from}} the rugged floor of the cave, and sat {{on a piece of}} <b>rock,</b> resting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
50|$|However his {{impressive}} {{winning streak}} {{came to a}} stop when he lost in a rematch to Semmy Schilt. Zimmerman did have <b>his</b> moments, where <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> <b>his</b> opponent multiple times, but his lack of mobility and head movement made him an easy target for the much taller Schilt. He lost the match when his corner threw in the towel in the third round.|$|R
60|$|As he {{neared the}} top, the current carried him against a sharp rock. Instead of {{clutching}} this, <b>he</b> hit the <b>rock</b> with <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The blow almost stunned him, and down he went once more, around {{the rock and}} along the river a distance of fully a hundred feet ere he again appeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad! Why, {{you ought}} to have thrown your gun on him. At least bounced a <b>rock</b> off <b>his</b> <b>head!</b> But say, Lucy, after all, maybe you've done enough. I guess you never thought of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} {{the end of the}} candle fell into the bottle which was of clear white glass, and there burned for a little while dully before it went out. Never shall I forget the scene illumined by its blue and ghastly light. The dying man lying on the low couch, <b>rocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to and fro; the wizard bending over him like some grey vampire bat sucking the life-blood from his {{helpless}} throat. The terror {{in the eyes of the}} one, the insatiable hate in the eyes of the other. Oh! it was awful! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help! help!" [...] came feebly {{from the}} inner end of the cave, and, guided by the flashlight, the four Rovers ran in that direction. They found the old man sitting on a <b>rock</b> with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> resting on <b>his</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|He heard a {{shout and}} nailed boots rattled. Deering was coming down, {{although}} he was not yet in Jimmy's line of view. After a time, Jimmy, lying against the <b>rock,</b> turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and saw Deering had got hold of the tree.|$|R
60|$|When Jones and I appeared, old Sultan {{abruptly}} {{turned his}} back to the hounds and looked down into the canyon. He walked the whole length of the bare <b>rock</b> with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> stretched over. He was looking for a niche or a step whereby he might again elude his foes.|$|R
60|$|And {{then he got}} it--suddenly, when he wasn't set for the punch; and <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> back on <b>his</b> heels.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> started <b>his</b> <b>rock</b> music {{career with}} the band The Headboys in 1977.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Billy; [...] "I'll tell 'em. Gee! Look who's comin' here," [...] and as {{he spoke}} he {{flattened}} himself to the ground just as a bullet pinged against the <b>rock</b> above <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and the report of a rifle sounded from up the canyon. [...] "That guy most got me. I'll have to be 'tendin' to business better'n this." ...|$|R
60|$|The prince's {{hand was}} as steady as a <b>rock.</b> <b>He</b> raised <b>his</b> glass to his lips.|$|R
50|$|The {{monument}} honors {{an unknown}} foot soldier from the 11th Louisiana Infantry, who died {{prior to the}} Battle of Munfordville. He {{was part of a}} tree-cutting detail. Ordered to rest, he lay down beside a tree. His loaded rifle accidentally discharged when it struck a tree branch; the bullet entered <b>his</b> <b>head</b> below <b>his</b> chin and killed him instantly. The soldier was buried with <b>rocks</b> marking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and feet. Years later, a wire fence was placed around the grave.|$|R
50|$|After waiting impatiently, Tom goes {{to search}} for Trisha, {{eventually}} stumbling upon her corpse. The killer appears and Tom attempts to flee, but he is killed by a giant <b>rock</b> crushing <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Sam and Blake chase each other around the school for fun, then finally decide to have sex in a parlor. The killer, disguised in a decorative suit of armor, shoots Blake with a crossbow and decapitates Sam.|$|R
50|$|Later, Scuffy meets up {{with his}} friends, Tootle, Katy Caboose, Poky Little Puppy, and Shy Little Kitten, and {{explains}} the problem. Despite their fears about getting into trouble, they agree to help Scuffy fix the breakwater. Tootle suggests logs and the Shy Little Kitten suggests sand, but after Katy Caboose comments on Scuffy having <b>rocks</b> in <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> Scuffy sees that a big rock from Cavetown is just what they need.|$|R
50|$|On 13 December 2013, Dinu won {{the third}} season edition of Bigger's Better, a boxing tournament under a {{familiar}} {{format of the}} popular UK Prizefighter series, with all the fights scheduled for three-minute rounds. <b>He</b> <b>rocked</b> through <b>his</b> first tournament in Greece, until to repeat the trick later {{in the same year}} in the super final from Portugal.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ansell hurried {{away and}} made a few inquiries. Meanwhile we watched the {{progress}} of the match. Every time Mr. Bundercombe had to turn <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> in <b>his</b> seat and retained his balance only with difficulty. At every successful effort he was loudly cheered by a little group of following enthusiasts. Mr. Ansell returned, looking a little more cheerful.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{depicts a}} larger-than-life Abraham Lincoln wearing a beard {{and sitting on}} a <b>rock</b> with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly bowed forward and his arms resting on his knees. Both of his hands are closed except for his extended right index finger. Lincoln is wearing a bow tie, vest, long coat and boots - his right boot extends just beyond {{the edge of the}} base. His watch chain is visible on his vest.|$|R
50|$|A ninth-generation Arkansan and Roman Catholic, Hill {{resides in}} Little <b>Rock.</b> <b>He</b> and <b>his</b> wife, Martha McKenzie, have two children.|$|R
6000|$|Here two {{men were}} [...] "driving" [...] the level, and another--a very tall, {{powerful}} man--was standing in a hole driven up slanting-ways into the roof, and cutting the <b>rock</b> above <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>His</b> attitude and aspect were extremely picturesque, standing as he did on a raised platform with his legs firmly planted, his muscular arms raised above him to cut the rock overhead, and the candle so placed as to cause his figure to appear almost black and unnaturally gigantic.|$|R
6000|$|Now <b>he</b> hangs, <b>he</b> <b>rocks</b> between, and <b>his</b> {{nostrils}} curdle in-- [...] Toll slowly. [...] Now he shivers {{head and}} hoof and the flakes of foam fall off, [...] And his face grows fierce and thin: ...|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} facts {{known about}} his childhood, {{according}} to Green Wing - The Complete First Series Scripts was that <b>he</b> watched Fraggle <b>Rock.</b> <b>His</b> favourite character was called Red, because both characters had similar coloured hair.|$|R
50|$|Bejenaru - {{currently}} undefeated - {{turned pro}} in 2011, winning {{the first season}} edition of Biggerâ€™s Better, a boxing tourney under a familiar format of the popular UK Prizefighter series, with all the fights scheduled for three-minute rounds. <b>He</b> <b>rocked</b> through <b>his</b> first tournament in Vilnius, Lithuania, with three easy victories, until to repeat the trick later {{in the same year}} in the super final from Croatia.|$|R
6000|$|He touched it, and {{she turned}} and went. But Owen did not go. He sat upon the <b>rock,</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bowed in misery. He had staked all his hopes upon this woman. She was the one {{desirable}} thing to him, the one star in his somewhat leaden sky, and now that star was eclipsed. Her words were unequivocal, they gave but little hope. Beatrice was scarcely a woman to turn round in six months or a year. On the contrary, there was a fixity about her which frightened him. What could {{be the cause of}} it? How came it that she should be so ready to reject him, and all he had to offer her? After all, she was a girl in a small position. She could not be looking forward to a better match. Nor would the prospect move her one way or another. There must be a reason for it. Perhaps he had a rival, surely that must be the cause. Some enemy had done this thing. But who? ...|$|R
60|$|Both {{looked up}} hurriedly {{and saw the}} wild man {{standing}} on the highest of the <b>rocks.</b> <b>He</b> had <b>his</b> arms folded and was glaring at them sternly.|$|R
50|$|At this location, {{far away}} from the eyes of the world, Cauragh desired to pass the {{remainder}} of his life praying to God and fasting. He became seriously ill at a later stage, and was dying when he prayed to God for water to quench his thirst. Having prayed for some time, he became aware of the sound of water trickling out of the <b>rock</b> above <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>He</b> put out his hand and drank freely of this miraculous water. He was cured as a result, and then he built the chapel.|$|R
50|$|The edited {{version of}} the film is shown in class, and Matt leaves the room in humiliation, while Owen puts <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down {{while the rest of the}} class talks and laughs through the entire movie. On their walk home from school, Owen has a <b>rock</b> thrown at <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> As Owen is icing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back at Mattâ€™s, Matt {{suggests}} that the movie would have been better if the two had actually shot the Dirties within their movie with real guns.|$|R
6000|$|Seating {{himself on}} a {{fragment}} of split <b>rock,</b> <b>he</b> smoked <b>his</b> cheroot to the butt, hearing men breathe hard all about him. Then he cried, so suddenly that they jumped: ...|$|R
60|$|After quitting {{the shore}} he {{continued}} slowly to ascend the mountain until he gained the summit. Here, seating {{himself on a}} <b>rock,</b> <b>he</b> lifted <b>his</b> eyes and looked slowly around him.|$|R

Many bloodhounds are freed {{to search for}} him, but one of them, Droopy, remains behind and informs the {{audience}} {{that he is the}} hero of the story. He quickly finds the wolf who tries to escape from Droopy throughout the picture. [...] However, everywhere he flees Droopy pops up. In the end Droopy crushes the wolf by dropping a huge <b>rock</b> on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> When Droopy receives his reward, he jumps about in complete enthusiasm, only to pause and inform the audience, [...] "I'm very happy".|$|R
