5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The notes were secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> awarded to Massachusetts, the money is used to pay off the GANs.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By {{the end of the}} day, all three denominations had been coined.|$|E
5000|$|Under a Currency Interchangeability Agreement in 1967, the Brunei <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> {{interchangeable}} {{with the}} Singapore dollar at par. As such, the Brunei <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> accepted in Singapore as [...] "customary tender"; likewise, the Singapore <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> accepted for payments in Brunei.|$|R

5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Class III <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel, {{which cost}} $9,575 ($ in [...] <b>dollars),</b> <b>was</b> {{dedicated}} on Memorial Day in 1881. Several thousand more <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> spent installing curbs, gutters, and pathway paving around the chapel.|$|R
50|$|After the {{settlement}} of Liang’s trial, about 260,000 <b>dollar</b> funds <b>were</b> returned to the donors.  About 325,000 <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> given to Liang’s family. About 80,000 <b>dollars</b> would <b>be</b> used for Chinese Communities.|$|R
25|$|As of 2016, the Singapore <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> {{the twelfth}} most traded {{currency}} {{in the world}} by value. Apart from its use in Singapore, the Singapore <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> also accepted as customary tender in Brunei according to the Currency Interchangeability Agreement between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam). Likewise, the Brunei <b>dollar</b> <b>is</b> also customarily accepted in Singapore.|$|R
5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E
5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate. The public announcement prompted a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources during a severe coin shortage, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 dollars had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. No 1964-D Peace <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> known to exist in either public or private hands. Two specimens were discovered in a Treasury vault in 1970 and were destroyed, but rumors and speculation about others in illegal private possession continue to appear from time to time. The issue has also been privately restruck using unofficial dies and genuine, earlier-date Peace dollars resulting in an altered date.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> the {{currency}} of British Columbia between 1865 and 1871. It replaced the British pound {{at a rate of}} 1 pound = 4.866 <b>dollars</b> and <b>was</b> equivalent to the Canadian dollar, which replaced it. The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> subdivided into 100 cents. No distinct coins were issued, with Canadian coins circulating.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> {{subdivided}} into four suku (Malay, Jawi: ﺳوکو, English: quarter), each of 100 keping (Malay, Jawi: کڤڠ or کفڠ; English: pieces). The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> equal in {{value to the}} Spanish <b>dollar.</b> It <b>was</b> replaced by the Netherlands Indies gulden after the Dutch took over control of colony from the British in 1824.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> the {{currency}} of Tobago until 1814. The currency comprised various cut Spanish dollars and countermarked French colonial coins. The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> subdivided into 11 bits, each of 9 pence. In 1814, sterling was established as the official currency of the island. Since 1905, dollars have once more circulated on Tobago, first the Trinidad and Tobago dollar, then the British West Indies dollar, before the Trinidad and Tobago <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced.|$|R

25|$|Canadian dollars, {{especially}} coins, {{are accepted}} by some {{businesses in the}} northernmost cities of the United States and in many Canadian snowbird enclaves, just as U.S. <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> accepted by some Canadian businesses.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> the {{currency}} of New Brunswick between 1860 and 1867. It replaced the pound {{at a rate of}} 4 dollars = 1 pound (5 shillings = 1 <b>dollar)</b> and <b>was</b> equal to the Canadian dollar. The New Brunswick <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> replaced by the Canadian dollar at par when New Brunswick entered the Canadian Confederation.|$|R
25|$|Coins of the Australian <b>dollar</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} on 14 February 1966, {{although they}} did not at that time include one-dollar or two-dollar coins. The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> equivalent in value to 10 shillings in the former currency (half of a pound).|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue was}} {{generally}} considered a success, and beginning in 1936, the silver dollar (in [...]800 fine silver) was struck more-or-less annually {{as a regular}} issue for general circulation, with the same reverse design as in 1935. Although commemorative <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> struck for circulation for the visit of King George VI in 1939, no regular issue <b>dollars</b> <b>were</b> struck that year, or, as it turned out, {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945. Thereafter, Voyageur <b>Dollars</b> <b>were</b> struck each year through 1966, except in years (e.g. 1935, 1939, and 1958) when a commemorative <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> struck for circulation. In 1967, a special [...] "flying goose" [...] design was struck for the Canadian Centennial.|$|R

25|$|It {{happens in}} every {{industry}} {{to millions of}} workers. Billions of <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> stolen when employers pay less than minimum wage; refuse overtime pay; force workers to work off the clock; hold back final paychecks; misclassify employees as independent contractors; steal tips; and fail to pay workers at all.|$|E
25|$|In essence, the {{government}} is promising to protect lenders against 80% of their potential loss, and legitimatizes the investment by first having the DOE review their applications. Moreover, because they are only guarantees, they are not considered government appropriations; no taxpayer <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> spent unless the loans fall through in a failed investment. Therefore, Congressional approval is thus easier to get.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the quarter}} eagle, {{designed}} by Sinnock, and the half <b>dollar</b> <b>were</b> {{struck in the}} maximum number authorized, but many were returned to the Mint for melting when they failed to sell. The Liberty Bell reverse for the half <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> later reused by Sinnock, again without giving Lewis credit, on the Chief Engraver's Franklin half <b>dollar,</b> which <b>was</b> first minted in 1948.|$|R

Over $10 billion have been spent and over 200 million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.|$|E
25|$|Nicaragua {{is among}} the poorest {{countries}} in the Americas. Its gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2008 was estimated at $17.37 billion USD. Agriculture represents 17% of GDP, the highest percentage in Central America. Remittances account for over 15% of the Nicaraguan GDP. Close to one billion <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> sent to the country by Nicaraguans living abroad. The economy grew {{at a rate of}} about 4% in 2011.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason the}} high cost of health care yields disappointing results is because only 0.05 percent of health care <b>dollars</b> <b>are</b> spent on {{assessing}} how well new health care technology works. This is largely because health care lobbyists oppose such research. For example, when the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research found that there was little evidence to support common back operations, orthopedic and neurosurgeons lobbied to cut funding for such research.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dollar</b> <b>was</b> the {{currency}} of Trinidad until 1814. The currency comprised various cut Spanish dollars and other Spanish colonial coins.

Most gold coins produced from 1863 and onward were produced for imports {{to pay for}} enormous amounts of war material and interest on some U.S. Government bonds. Many of these coins from the Civil War and after (silver coins included) are in excellent condition since they saw very limited circulation with greenbacks and postage currency taking their place.|$|R
