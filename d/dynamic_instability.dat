25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Agusta {{designed}} the A109 originally as a single-engine commercial helicopter. However, {{it was soon}} realised that a twin-engine design was needed and it was re-designed in 1969 with two Allison 250-C14 turboshaft engines. A projected military version (the A109B) was considered early on but Agusta initially chose not to pursue immediate development, instead concentrating on the eight-seat A109C version. The first of three prototypes made its maiden flight on 4 August 1971. The A109's flight testing phase was prolonged, this was {{due in part to}} the discovery of <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> which took a year to resolve via a modified transmission design; this led to the first production aircraft being completed almost four years later in April 1975. On 1 June 1975, certification for visual flight rules (VFR) upon the A109 was received from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).|$|E
25|$|The AU-24A Stallion had {{the same}} side-mounted gun, as well as five underwing and {{fuselage}} stations. In January 1972, the second test phase for the AU-24A began at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. The initial aircraft used, 72-1319, was leased from Helio and retained its civilian configuration, but it allowed basic flight testing to begin. The combat evaluation of the Credible Chase program was canceled in February 1972, but the initial (stateside) evaluation was kept on the program schedule. The first combat equipped AU-24A was delivered on 4 March 1972, and operational test and evaluation began on 17 March, but was delayed after a review of contractor quality control began on 3 April. On 10 April, the review imposed a number of flight restrictions on the AU-24A limiting maximum airspeed, dive and bank angles, and all instrument, weather and night test flights. The OT of the AU-24A was officially started over on 22 April, and by 3 May, the aircraft was again in trouble. This time the problem was a <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> during flight. The problems were resolved by 12 May, and the test program continued until completion on 22 May. Starting on 28 June, the AU-24As were flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. for storage. The Credible Chase program was canceled and no AU-24A was delivered to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.|$|E

Introduction {{of the new}} smart city-Coupé was planned for March, 1998, however <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> of the prototypes prompted Daimler-Benz to announce postponing the launch until October, 1998. Johann Tomforde was replaced as chief engineer by Gerhard Fritz. Fritz lowered the centre of gravity, widened the track, stiffened the suspension, changed the steering, and added ballast weight {{to the front of}} the car in order to increase its stability in emergency avoidance manoeuvres (notably the Swedish [...] "moose test").|$|E

2500|$|The major {{advantage}} to suspended maglev systems {{is that they}} work at all speeds, unlike electrodynamic systems, which only work at a minimum speed of about [...] This {{eliminates the need for}} a separate low-speed suspension system, and can simplify track layout.

Eric Laithwaite was concerned that to meet required tolerances, the gap between magnets and rail would have to be increased {{to the point where the}} magnets would be unreasonably large. In practice, this problem was addressed through improved feedback systems, which support the required tolerances.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth cone}} is {{described}} in terms of three regions: the peripheral (P) domain, the transitional (T) domain, and the central (C) domain. The peripheral domain is the thin region surrounding {{the outer edge of the}} growth cone. It is composed primarily of an actin-based cytoskeleton, and contains the lamellipodia and filopodia which are highly dynamic. [...] Microtubules, however, are known to transiently enter the peripheral region via a process called <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability.</b> [...] The central domain is located in the center of the growth cone nearest to the axon. This region is composed primarily of a microtubule-based cytoskeleton, is generally thicker, and contains many organelles and vesicles of various sizes. [...] The transitional domain is the region located in the thin band between the central and peripheral domains.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{chromosome}} {{movements in}} relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One {{of the most interesting}} features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show [...] "directional instability", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem {{to be part of a}} mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization.|$|E
40|$|When two {{deformable}} bodies {{separated by}} a frictional interface start to slide with each other, dynamic "ruptures" (transitions from sticking to sliding) occur at the interface. The ruptures trigger waves that propagate inside the bodies and along the interface. Wave generation and propagation at contact frictional interfaces is at {{the origin of the}} friction induced vibrations and can cause <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> surface damages, wear and fatigue failures. It affects directly a plurality of mechanical systems involving either static or sliding frictional parts. Moreover when the two materials in contact are different, which is the most common case in mechanics, the dynamics of the phenomenon could increase in complexity due to the so-called "bimaterial" effect. The aim of this 2 D numerical work is to investigate the relationship between the macroscopic behavior of the system (stick-slip, continuous sliding, <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> etc.) and the local dynamics at the contact (wave generation and propagation, ruptures at the contact interface) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{practice}} a rotating flexible thin annular disk {{has to be}} operated at low speed, because three types of <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> inevitably occur around critical and supercritical speeds, namely: aeroelastic, parametric and thermoelastic. The rotating disk is clamped and driven by a drive shaft attached to the disk inner edge. The external action of the flowing surrounding air causes the aeroelastic instability; a slider mass-damper-spring-friction moving load causes parametric instability; and disk/slider interface friction heat can cause thermoelastic instability. A thermal boundary control method is used to induce disk thermal membrane stresses utilizing drive shaft temperature increments to stabilize these <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Fundamental investigations are made of disk temperature distribution, thermal stress, natural frequency, dynamic stability and steady state amplitude to validate and demonstrate {{the viability of the}} new control method. The thermal boundary control method offers valuable opportunities for rotating disk applications operating over critical and supercritical high speeds with high efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Lightweight {{aircraft}} design emphasizes {{the reduction of}} structural weight to maximize aircraft efficiency and agility {{at the cost of}} increasing the likelihood of structural <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> To ensure flight safety, extensive flight testing and active structural servo control strategies are required to explore and expand the boundary of the flight envelope. Aeroservoelastic (ASE) models can provide online flight monitoring of <b>dynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> to reduce flight time testing and increase flight safety. The success of ASE models is determined by the ability to take into account varying flight conditions and the possibility to perform flight monitoring under the presence of active structural servo control strategies. In this continued study, these aspects are addressed by developing specific methodologies and algorithms for control relevant robust identification and model validation of aeroservoelastic structures. The closed-loop model robust identification and model validation are based on a fractional model approach where the model uncertainties are characterized in a closed-loop relevant way...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> of microtubules is also {{required}} for the migration of most mammalian cells that crawl. Dynamic microtubules regulate the levels of key G-proteins such as RhoA and Rac1, which regulate cell contractility and cell spreading. Dynamic microtubules are {{also required}} to trigger focal adhesion disassembly, which is necessary for migration. It {{has been found that}} microtubules act as “struts” that counteract the contractile forces that are needed for trailing edge retraction during cell movement. When microtubules in the trailing edge of cell are dynamic, they are able to remodel to allow retraction. When dynamics are suppressed, microtubules cannot remodel and, therefore, oppose the contractile forces. The morphology of cells with suppressed microtubule dynamics indicate that cells can extend the front edge (polarized in the direction of movement), but have difficulty retracting their trailing edge. On the other hand, high drug concentrations, or microtubule mutations that depolymerize the microtubules, can restore cell migration but there is a loss of directionality. It can be concluded that microtubules act both to restrain cell movement and to establish directionality ...|$|E
2500|$|Flutter is a <b>dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> of {{an elastic}} {{structure}} in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body's deflection {{and the force}} exerted by the fluid flow. In a linear system, 'flutter point' is {{the point at which}} the structure is undergoing simple harmonic motion - zero net damping - and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a self-oscillation and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the aerodynamic force. Flutter can be classified into two types: hard flutter, in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and soft flutter, in which the net damping decreases gradually. Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method. In water the mass ratio of the [...] pitch inertia of the foil vs that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>instability</b> {{refers to}} the {{coexistence}} of assembly and disassembly {{at the ends of}} a microtubule. The microtubule can dynamically switch between growing and shrinking phases in this region. Tubulin dimers can bind two molecules of GTP, one of which can be hydrolyzed subsequent to assembly. [...] During polymerization, the tubulin dimers are in the GTP-bound state. [...] The GTP bound to α-tubulin is stable and it plays a structural function in this bound state. However, the GTP bound to β-tubulin may be hydrolyzed to GDP shortly after assembly. The assembly properties of GDP-tubulin are different from those of GTP-tubulin, as GDP-tubulin is more prone to depolymerization. A GDP-bound tubulin subunit at the tip of a microtubule will tend to fall off, although a GDP-bound tubulin {{in the middle of a}} microtubule cannot spontaneously pop out of the polymer. [...] Since tubulin adds onto the end of the microtubule in the GTP-bound state, a cap of GTP-bound tubulin is proposed to exist at the tip of the microtubule, protecting it from disassembly. [...] When hydrolysis catches up to the tip of the microtubule, it begins a rapid depolymerization and shrinkage. This switch from growth to shrinking is called a catastrophe. [...] GTP-bound tubulin can begin adding to the tip of the microtubule again, providing a new cap and protecting the microtubule from shrinking. This is referred to as [...] "rescue".|$|E

Ripples are thought to form {{as the result of}} local instabilities, which are believed to occur when the amplitude of gravity waves becomes large enough. We have investigated ripple formation based on years of airglow imager observations located at Fort Collins, Colorado (41 ° N, 105 ° W) and Misato Observatory, Japan (34 ° N, 135 ° E) /Shigaraki MU Observatory (35 ° N, 136 ° E).
