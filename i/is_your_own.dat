500|$|His {{preparations}} complete, Cochrane {{ordered the}} attack {{for the evening}} of 11 April, although Gambier was reluctant to allow his sailors to support Cochrane in the operation, saying [...] "if you choose to rush to self-destruction that <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> affair [...] [...] [...] but it is my duty {{to take care of}} the lives of others, and I will not place the crews of the fireships in palpable danger". Cochrane was furious and after a bitter argument Gambier relented and gave permission for the attack to go ahead. He stationed Imperieuse near the Boyart Shoal to the north of the boom, approximately [...] from the French fleet, supported by frigates HMS Aigle, HMS Unicorn and HMS Pallas. This force would collect the crews of the fireships as they abandoned their blazing charges and rowed back towards the British line, and sloops HMS Redpole and HMS Lyra were equipped as light ships to guide the fireships into the channel. [...] With these ships were the schooner HMS Whiting and cutters Nimrud and King George, all converted into floating rocket batteries. Aetna and two brigs anchored north of the forts on Île-d'Aix, while frigate Emerald and five smaller warships were to launch a diversionary attack to the east of the island. Gambier, with the main body of the fleet, moved closer to the entrance to Aix Roads, eventually anchoring [...] distant; it has been suggested by one historian that he may have done so in order that he could retreat out to sea easily should the French fleet attempt to attack him in the aftermath of a failed fireship assault.|$|E

[...] "There's something more satisfying about working in a play. You get that immediate response from the audience, and you feel that your performance <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> In pictures, you get frustrated because you feel you have no power over what you’re doing", Farrell told syndicated columnist Bob Thomas in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone put it there and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools complain that they are unable to read all the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if you find it too hard, it <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> fault, because you do not study it.|$|E
