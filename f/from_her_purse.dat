5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride. He removed all three items <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> and hid them.|$|E
25|$|Linda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him {{to change}} Earl's will. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does not want it. The lawyer {{suggests}} she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite Colville's pledge Balfour {{was found}} guilty of conspiring to murder by the use of {{witchcraft}} and was sentenced to be strangled and burned. On 16 December 1594 Balfour was taken to Gallow Ha' in Kirkwall to be executed. Before the strangulation she was required to make a declaration in front of the gathered crowd and five ministers, including Colville, for the notary public; instead she proclaimed her innocence and detailed the tortures carried out against her and her family. Immediately prior to Balfour's sentence being enacted, attempts were made to have her implicate the Laird of Stenhouse, Patrick Bellenden, in the conspiracy by questioning her about a piece of wax he had given her. It had been retrieved <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> when she was arrested and her inquisitors considered it was to make an effigy. She denied their claims stating it was to produce a treatment for Lady Bellenden's colic.|$|E

60|$|Early in the {{afternoon}} on finding that her patient was little better, my landlady {{went off to the}} chemist's to get me some physic; I could bear inactivity no longer, and rose and dressed. The fire was low, the room sluggish, when in the dusk, as I sat dismally brooding in my chair, the door opened, and a stranger came in with my tea. She was dressed in black, and was carrying a light. With that raised in one hand, and my tea-tray held between finger and thumb of the other, she looked at me with face a little sidelong. Her hair was dark above her clear pale skin, and drawn, without a fringe, smoothly over her brows. Her eyes were almost unnaturally light in colour. I looked at her in astonishment; she was new in my world. She put the tray on my table, poked the fire into a blaze, blew out her candle at a single puff <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>pursed</b> lips, and seating herself on the hearthrug, clasped her hands round her knees.|$|R

Fighting alongside his daughters and Nefario, Gru and his team return the Minions to their normal, friendly, yellow state using jelly containing a powerful antidote that was created by Nefario. Macho then takes the mutagen himself and turns into a giant, violent and vicious purple-haired monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick Taser and a fart gun.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank {{statements}} and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico. Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey. During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this {{did not include a}} gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico. Afterwards, Selena again met with Saldívar in her hotel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi. At the hotel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar got a gun <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing an artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a -long trail of blood. She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a [...] "bitch". Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was, however, spotted by a responding police cruiser. She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI. By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.|$|E

She then shot herself in the stomach. The train conductor reported that when he opened the compartment door, Alice gasped [...] "I did it" [...] and then collapsed.|$|E

50|$|After {{vanishing}} from Samuel's carnival, Hiro Nakamura {{appears in}} Tokyo, where he begins asking vendors random questions, referencing comic books and science fiction such as Batman, Star Trek, Star Wars, and Sherlock Holmes. He is eventually arrested after using {{a knife to}} prevent a woman <b>from</b> having <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> stolen, and Ando Masahashi picks Hiro up from the station. Ando fears that Hiro's brain tumor may be starting to affect him, but then realizes that Hiro is trying to tell him something. After going through Hiro's comic book collection, Ando deduces that Hiro wants {{them to go to}} a psychiatric hospital in Florida. Ando proudly wishes to travel with Hiro once again.|$|R
60|$|None whatever. As {{the son of}} her mother's first husband, by that husband's first wife, {{not even}} the widest stretch of {{courtesy}} could have included him {{at any time in}} the list of Mrs. Vanstone's most distant relations. Well knowing this (the letter proceeded to say), he had nevertheless persisted in forcing himself upon her as a species of family connection: and she had weakly sanctioned the intrusion, solely from the dread that he would otherwise introduce himself to Mr. Vanstone's notice, and take unblushing advantage of Mr. Vanstone's generosity. Shrinking, naturally, <b>from</b> allowing <b>her</b> husband to be annoyed, and probably cheated as well, by any person who claimed, however preposterously, a family connection with herself, it had been her practice, for many years past, to assist the captain <b>from</b> <b>her</b> own <b>purse,</b> on the condition that he should never come near the house, and that he should not presume to make any application whatever to Mr. Vanstone.|$|R
2500|$|Evans' final {{arrest was}} on May 11, 1985 for {{harboring}} Marilyn Jean Buck, a fugitive in the 1981 Brinks armored truck robbery case, {{in which two}} police officers and a guard were murdered. At {{the time of her}} arrest, Evans was wearing [...] a wig and glasses to disguise herself. The FBI agents obtained <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> a Browning 9mm pistol and false documents with the name of Rebecca Ann Morgan, Christine Johnson, and Louise Robinett. The FBI was able to trace the gun to Louisiana, where Linda Evans was found to have purchased four firearms and three boxes of ammunition from three separate businesses under the false identity of Louise Robinett. Having purchased the four guns under a false identification, Evans was charged with eleven violations of the Gun Control Act of 1968. From March 16 to March 20, 1987 she was tried before a jury. Along with the eleven violations charges and housing a fugitive, she was also charged for terrorist actions after 740 pounds of dynamite were found in her apartment along with evidence of a plan to target the U.S Capitol Building, the National War College, the Navy Yard Computer Center, the Navy Yard Officers Club, Israeli Aircraft Industries, the FBI and the New York Patrolman’s Benevolent Association. On March 20, 1987 she was found guilty of all charges and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Gerda and Henrietta enter. [...] Henrietta asks Gerda {{what she}} has done with the holster of the murder weapon, stating that {{if they can get}} rid of that, there will be no evidence, and no one will be convicted of the murder.

50|$|The tale {{follows the}} life of a young man named Fortunatus from {{relative}} obscurity through his adventures towards fame and fortune; it subsequently follows the careers of his two sons. Fortunatus was a native, says the story, of Famagusta in Cyprus, and meeting the goddess of Fortune in a forest received <b>from</b> <b>her</b> a <b>purse</b> which was continually replenished as often as he drew from it. With this he wandered through many lands, and at Cairo was the guest of the sultan. Among the treasures which the sultan showed him was an old napless hat which had the power of transporting its wearer to any place he desired. Of this hat, he feloniously possessed himself and returned to Cyprus, where he led a luxurious life. On his death he left the purse and the hat to his sons Ampedo and Andelosia; but they were jealous of each other, and by their recklessness and folly soon fell on evil days.|$|R

60|$|She {{was much}} put about. She hunted round {{everywhere}} for it. And, as she sought, the conviction {{came into her}} heart {{that her husband had}} taken it. What she had in <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> was all the money she possessed. But that he should sneak it <b>from</b> <b>her</b> thus was unbearable. He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him, and at the week-end he had put the shilling again into <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he had not paid back.|$|R
