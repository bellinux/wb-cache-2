To {{take away the}} power to prosecute from the president {{and give it to}} somebody who’s not under his control is a terrible erosion of presidential power. And it was wrenching not only because it came out wrong—I was the sole dissenter—but because the opinion was written by Rehnquist, who had been head of the Office of Legal Counsel, before me, and who I thought would realize the importance of that power of the president to prosecute. And he not only wrote the opinion; he wrote it in a manner that was more extreme than <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> Brennan would have written it. That was wrenching." ...|$|R

I used to finish some of Bill's things... he would come up with the riffs, but I would be the finish guy for that. I sat down and came up with the chorus, the bridges, and so forth. I remember we showed it to Mike and Michael when they came in later; definitely we had the song finished. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> played bass and I played guitar; we kept going around with it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we might have played some mandolin on it in the rehearsal studio." ...|$|R

5000|$|At the 1988 World's Strongest Man the two rivals clashed again. As {{expected}} Kazmaier {{dominated the}} static events while Jón Páll, who had shed body-weight to cater {{for all the}} dynamic tests of strength of World's Strongest Man instead of the latter statically orientated events of Pure Strength 1987, was often victorious in the more athletic, speed- and endurance-oriented events.

50|$|Technology changes. We are {{now able}} to color these comics with an {{infinite}} palette, and to reproduce the artists' linework much more clearly. If these new computer generated color techniques had been available in the 1950s, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> Gaines would have used it because it makes the EC work even more beautiful. So the EC material has been printed three different ways: with the old color, as originally published back in the 1950s, without any color, as it was drawn by the EC artists (the EC Library), and with the best color we can do with modern technology (the EC Archives). It has been my experience that the most dedicated EC fans are not satisfied to have them reprinted only one, or two, ways. They want them all. Those fans will have the old comics in the EC Annuals, the black and white art in the EC Library, and the best color we can produce in the EC Archives. There's room there for everyone.|$|R

[...] <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> said that in retrospect, [...] "Everything I have said has been factually accurate, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the mistake <b>I</b> made was to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was a spouse {{just like any other}} spouse who could defend his candidate. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can promote Hillary but not defend her because I was president." ...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{recording}} of Never Say Die! the members of Black Sabbath were all heavily involved in drug and alcohol abuse. Prior to recording, vocalist Osbourne briefly quit the band and was temporarily replaced by former Savoy Brown and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Dave Walker. In 1992, guitarist Tony Iommi explained to Guitar World, [...] "We never wanted him to leave, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he wanted to come back - but no one would tell the other how they felt. So we had to bring in another singer and write all new material." [...] The band wrote a handful of songs with Walker, with that short-lived line-up even performing an early version of what would later become [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC programme Look Hear. Osbourne eventually rejoined the band, refusing to sing any of the songs written with Walker. Iommi elaborated in the 1992 Guitar World piece, ... Bill Ward had to sing on one track ("Swinging The Chain") because Ozzy refused to sing it. We ended up having to write in the day so we could record in the evening, and we never had time to review the tracks and make changes. As a result, the album sounds very confused. [...] The songs with Walker were redone, including [...] "Junior's Eyes", which was rewritten to be about the then-recent death of Osbourne's father. [...] "We had a few internal problems", Osbourne admitted to Sounds magazine at the time. [...] "My father was dying, so that put us out for over three months with the funeral and everything. I left the band for three months before we got back together to record it." [...] However, the writing was on the wall, with Osbourne stating in his memoir I Am Ozzy, [...] "No one really talked about what had happened. I just turned up in the studio one day - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Bill</b> had been trying to act as peacemaker on the phone - {{and that was the end}} of it. But it was obvious things had changed, especially between me and Tony. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> anyone's heart was in it anymore." ...|$|R

[...] This was a repetition of his tactic before March 4, warning supporters that his wife {{might not be able to}} continue if she did not win Ohio and Texas. Hillary Clinton emphasized that Pennsylvania was something of a home state for her, as her father came from Scranton, Pennsylvania, she and her brothers were christened there and had vacationed near there each summer, and her brothers still maintained the family cottage near there.|$|R
