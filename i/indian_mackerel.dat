40|$|International audienceRound scad {{mackerel}} sampled in 1995 - 1998 were {{analysed for}} genetic variation using mitochondrial and nuclear-DNA markers. Sequence variation for {{a fragment of}} the cytochrome b gene (mitochondrial), amplified by polymerase chain reaction, was screened across individuals using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Sequence analysis of all SSCP haplotypes indicated two mitochondrial clades separated by 2. 3 % nucleotide divergence on the average. The geographic distribution of haplotypes was homogeneous (Weir and Cockerham's ^θ=- 0. 002). Also, no geographical heterogeneity was detected for length polymorphism of Intron 1 of the gene encoding aldolase B (^θ= 0. 005). While homogeneity in allele frequencies throughout the Indo-Malay archipelago conformed to the expectations for a widely distributed pelagic fish in a highly connected habitat, this was at variance with the sharp geographic structure previously uncovered in <b>Indian</b> scad <b>mackerel,</b> D. russelli, a fish with life-history characteristics similar to D. macrosoma. A remarkable similarity however was the occurrence of two similarly distinct clades within each species, suggesting a common history of geographic isolation. Low sea levels in the Pleistocene might have caused the separation and vicariance of populations within both D. macrosoma and D. russelli. Subsequent genetic exchange between populations would then have erased allele-frequency differences at the cytochrome b and aldolase B loci in D. macrosoma while some barrier to gene flow was maintained in D. russelli...|$|R
40|$|The {{mackerel}} icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) is a prominent {{member of the}} coastal fish fauna of the Seasonal Pack-Ice Zone and the islands north of it. Separated {{into a number of}} stocks, its distribution ranges from the Scotia Arc region, namely South Georgia, in the Atlantic Ocean sector to the Kerguelen-Heard Plateau in the <b>Indian</b> Ocean sector. <b>Mackerel</b> icefish have been heavily exploited {{since the beginning of the}} 1970 s with reported annual catches exceeding 50 – 100, 000 tonnes in some years. C. gunnari has many characteristics typical of Antarctic fish species with respect to life history characteristics, such as egg size, fecundity and growth. These fall well within the range of other sympatric red-blooded notothenioids; eggs are large and yolky. Egg diameter, egg production per gram body weight and growth performance at South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands was comparable with similar-sized nototheniids and channichthyids. Stocks of C. gunnari have a number of biological characteristics in common, such as feeding mode and food, early life history and growth in the first years of life. However, stocks in sub-Antarctic waters differ in reproductive characteristics, such as length and age at first spawning, natural mortality and life expectancy from those on more southerly grounds. They may grow to more than 60 cm and may become 13 – 15 yrs old. However, in the vicinity of South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands, fish apparently do not exhaust this growth potential fully. Their ability to reproduce at an early age coupled with a comparatively high fecundity and growth performance may mean stocks of C. gunnari in sub-antarctic waters have far more resilience and a greater capacity to rebuild than species with the slower reproductive rates common in other notothenioids...|$|R

50|$|The shrimp variety {{includes}} the species of Penaeus indicus and Penaeus monodon among 12 other. Surveys in the Arabian Sea indicate that commercial species of crustaceans like shrimps and lobsters are overexploited. Crabs, cephalopods and other molluscs are an unconventional resource. However, {{there is a}} potential in the export market as a substitute for these. Demersal fish resources show signs of being exploited, hence only limited expansion of catch is possible in future. There may be a possibility of expanding the catch the small pelagic fish resources by venturing further offshore. It is very much likely that the fishermen would have to consider using new fishing methods in order to achieve this. As for the larger variety of pelagic fish, especially Skipjack tuna and its relatives, are available in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Pakistan in the Karachi District. Fishing for these usually result in by-catches of marlin and shark species. Local fishing fleet commonly harvests the species of Frigate mackerel, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Spanish mackerel, barracuda and dolphinfish. The production figures of 2006 showed overexploitation relative to maximum sustainable yield level. A large variety of mesopelagic fish exist just off the continental shelf and are barely exploited. These resources are prime candidates for conversion to fishmeal for use in poultry and aquaculture but no commercial use is available in the country. Mussels, oysters, clams, seaweed, kelp, sea urchins and other marine resources also exist in Pakistan but further research data is required in order to evaluate the feasibility of propagating the mariculture of these varieties.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E

40|$|Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, India {{provides}} fishery forecast services {{all along}} the Indian coast free of cost, referred to as ‘Potential Fishery Zone (PFZ) Advisories’. These services include georeferenced maps showing marked regions where probability of finding sizeable schools of fishes is high. These advisories are provided to help the fisher folks to improve their income from fishing by saving engine fuel for searching and locating fish stocks. Based on 124 controlled fishing experiments {{carried out in the}} PFZ and Non-PFZ zones along the Kerala coast during 2008 - 2012 periods, the present study evidenced that commercially important fishes were abundant in the PFZ, forming richer fisheries compared to the non-PFZ areas. The profit from controlled experiments showed consistently higher values in the PFZ than that in the non-PFZ. The highest profit during the entire controlled fishing experiments was obtained when the catch was dominated by relatively high-priced fishes such as tunas, carangids, seer fishes and mackerel. Indian oil sardine was the major single species obtained during the Northeast Monsoon (November-February), whereas, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> dominated during the Southwest Monsoon (June-October) and Spring Intermonsoon (March – May) periods. Anchovies were found to dominate only in two fishing experiments in the entire study period. The analyses of catch data of the small pelagic fishes of interest (Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy) showed that the PFZ advisories better predicted the catches of Indian oil sardine during the Northeast Monsoon (November- February) and <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{during the rest of the}} period. Conversely, the catch data of controlled experiments showed that PFZ advisory has less efficiency to support the exploitation of anchovies. Attempts have been made to outline the recurrent PFZ along the Kerala coast based on the advisories generated for the study period (2008 - 2012). Altogether 432 PFZ advisories were digitised and month-wise repeat PFZs have been demarcated. In general, most of the very prominent recurrent PFZs were found within the 50 m depth contour. The highest number of recurrent PFZs was in December, January and February. On the other hand, the lowest number of recurrent PFZs was found in April, May and June. Plankton components in the diet of Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy based on fortnightly fish samples analysed during a year period are presented. Coscinodiscus, Nitzschia, Pleurosigma and Thalassiosira were found in the gut of Indian oil sardine almost throughout the year, whereas microzooplankton was mostly dominant only during the October – December period. Coscinodiscus and Tintinids were predominant in the gut of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> throughout the year. Furthermore, Thalassiosira, Ceratium, Dinophysis, Protoperidinium, Pyrophacus and copepods were also found in the gut of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> almost throughout the year. The dominant value index showed the dominance of phytoplankton, microzooplankton and copepods in the diet of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> throughout the year, indicating their almost equal preference for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. The food items in the gut content of Commerson’s anchovy showed characteristic difference from both Indian oil sardine and <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and found to be a zooplankton feeder predominantly feeding on copepods, fish eggs, ostracods, lucifers and tintinids. The environmental observations based on monthly field sampling carried out in two locations (10 m and 20 m depth contours) situated off Kochi are presented. During seven out of nine observations, PFZ bands were observed around 10 m location. High values of chlorophyll (> 3 mg m- 3) were found in August, September and October, which could be attributed to the combined effect of Cochin backwater influx and upwelling. The seasonal evolution of hydrographical parameters showed significantly higher concentration of nutrients and chlorophyll during the Southwest Monsoon period compared to the rest of the sampling. The chlorophyll concentration was found to be significantly higher in 10 m location (PFZ) compared to the 20 m location (non-PFZ). The status of the Length-Weight Relationship (LWR) and condition factor of Indian oil sardine, <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Commerson’s anchovy along the Kerala coast is presented. The LWR of Commerson’s anchovy is the very first detailed report from this region. LWR and condition factor of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Oil sardine were not significantly different from the values reported in the historical studies, indicating that these parameters are not affected significantly by the expected long-term environmental changes. The results of the growth and maturity studies of the small pelagic fishes of interest have been discussed. The analyses were based on a fortnightly sampling carried out in two major landing centres during 2010 – 2011 periods. The maximum life span of Indian oil sardine was estimated to be 2. 63 years. Two peaks of recruitment of juveniles to the fishery were observed; a large peak during July - August and a small peak in February - March. The length at first maturity was calculated as 15. 7 cm while the length at first capture was 15 cm, suggesting that the peak exploitation of the species occurs before they attain sexual maturity. Comparison of the length at first maturity of oil sardine reported in historical studies with the present study shows that only minor variation exists between the two. The life span of <b>Indian</b> <b>mackerel</b> is estimated to be 2 years. The recruitment pattern showed the presence of mature mackerel all year round.
