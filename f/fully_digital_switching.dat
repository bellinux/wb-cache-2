5000|$|The next {{generation}} of systems evolved from the SP1 design to replace the analog switch with a digital technology. SP-1 proved the feasibility of software-controlled systems for telephony. It {{set the stage for}} the introduction of fully digital systems with the development of the DMS (Digital Multiplex Systems) by Nortel in the 1970s. (Nortel's SL-1 (PBX) was Nortel's first <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> system, and it was introduced in service in 1975.) ...|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the phone}} {{companies}} in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks, but simply {{as a matter of}} course while moving to <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling. Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s.|$|E

5000|$|Viable, <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> <b>switches</b> {{emerged in}} the 1970s, with early systems like the French Alcatel E10 and Candian Nortel DMS going live during that decade. Other widely adopted systems hit {{the market in the}} early 1980s. These {{included}} Ericsson AXE 10, which would become the world's most popular switching platform, the Western Electric 5ESS used through the US and in many other countries, the German designed Siemens ESWD, the ITT System 12 (later rebranded Alcatel S12) and NEC NEAX all of which were widely used around the world.

25|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> local <b>switching</b> system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, {{the company}} name was changed to Northern Telecom Limited, and {{management}} announced its intention to concentrate the company's efforts on digital technology. Northern Telecom was the first company in its industry to announce and to deliver a complete line of <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> telecommunications products. The product line was branded [...] "Digital World" [...] and included the well known DMS-100, a <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> central office <b>switch</b> serving as many as 100,000 lines, which was a key contributor to the company's revenue for close to 15 years.|$|R
50|$|Equally {{in terms}} of {{switching}} apparatus STC was a major player. In 1971 STC, installed a <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> (PCM) controlled telephone exchange at Moorgate in the City of London. It was a “tandem exchange” switching PCM multiplexes between several other exchanges. Until 1980 TXE4 analogue electronic switch was an early replacement for electro-mechanical systems. Before a politically engineered withdrawal in 1982, STC and its (now equally defunct) partners, Plessey and GEC, developed the <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> System X <b>switch</b> which is still in service in many UK facilities in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Warman {{held over}} 100 patents, but the {{recognition}} that he truly deserved eluded him, and some {{say that it was}} because of his quest for perfection. His career started off at Siemens Brothers at Woolwich, and he remained there when AEI took over the company. AEI was then taken over by GEC, who, in 1968, closed down the development of TXE exchanges in favour of crossbar. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake, as Warman was only too aware. All the AEI staff were sacked, including those on the TXE project, and it was then that Warman joined GTE International, the American company, as European technical director based in Milan, along with some members of his team from AEI. However, Warman persisted in basing his developments on reed electronic (analogue) principles, when it had already become clear that <b>fully</b> electronic <b>digital</b> <b>switches</b> were now the obvious path forward. Some time later, GTE decided to closedown the development team in Europe and so Warman’s work came to an end, at least for GTE. He returned to the UK and set up his own company, but it was not a success, and his health failed, which led to an early and impoverished death.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a {{development of a}} wideband deltasigma modulator for <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> GHz transmitters. The <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> RF transmitter is developed as a promising solution for software defined radio (SDR) terminals and applications. The <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> transmitter consists of a delta-sigma modulator, a highspeed multiplexer and a switching-mode power amplifier. The speed limitation of delta-sigma modulator is the main limitation to increase the signal bandwidth in <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> transmitters. In this paper, the bandwidth of the <b>fully</b> <b>digital</b> transmitter is increased 8 times using parallel processing time-interleaved architecture, while maintaining the same signal quality. This architecture was implemented on FPGA and tested for different standards (WiMAX and LTE) with a signal bandwidth up to 8 MHz. The concept was assessed in terms of SNDR by using a differential logic analyzer at the output of FPGA, and the SNDR {{was found to be}} around 60 dB. 1...|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics <b>switches</b> for <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of <b>switches</b> in <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage switching arrays in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal <b>switching</b> points of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> arrays of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time switching array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array of switching centre. The program which determines possible proposals of switching arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R
