5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{interpreted as}} the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean these Iguanodon were herding animals.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> constitute a bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} visible Hispanic {{legacies}} is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came {{as a result of}} a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua, which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean that their number {{reflects}} the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard.

5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> mean better sexual function; for example, people with {{injuries}} in the sacral region {{are less likely to}} be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no connotation {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E
