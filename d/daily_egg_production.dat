5000|$|Henopause, a wordplay {{combination}} of [...] "" [...] and [...] "menopause", is sometimes {{used to refer}} to the point at which hens stop laying eggs. Although <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> starts to tail off after 1 year old, it may continue until 5-7 years old. Older hens gradually produce fewer eggs, and the eggs are usually larger. Since the average lifespan of a pet layer hen is 8-15 years, henopause has received attention as a potential problem for backyard or urban chicken farmers who are eventually faced with the decision to either slaughter older layers or keep them as non-producing pets. In the UK, the British Hen Welfare Trust charity rescues commercial hens who would otherwise be sent to slaughter when they become no longer commercially viable.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate an appropriate inclusion level of locally produced unprocessed or expander-processed coloured flowered faba bean (FB) (cv. ‘Kontu’) seeds in diets for laying hens. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> and <b>egg</b> quality variables were determined with 560 hens (Lohmann Selected Leghorn, LSL Classic) in a 40 -week continued experiment. The hens were fed one of the five diets containing soybean meal as the main protein source. A diet without FB was served as a control diet. Both unprocessed and expander-processed FB was tested either in proportions of 50 g kg- 1 or 100 g kg- 1 in the diet. Faba bean inclusion (control vs. FB diets) had no effect on the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rate, <b>egg</b> mass <b>production,</b> feed consumption, or feed conversion ratio, but it decreased egg weight (p< 0. 05). Dietary FB inclusion tended to increase the mortality of the hens (p< 0. 10).

40|$|SYNOPSIS. This paper {{develops}} a model based on egg-laying rates and female ovi-position temperature preferences in {{two species of}} cicada, Cacama valvata and Tibicen bifidus, from a central New Mexico desert grassland habitat. Output from the model indicates that C. valvata achieves maximal <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (eggs female' 1 day 1) on days when maximum shade ambient temperatures reach 41 °C; the corresponding value for T. bifidus is 33 °C. These differences correlate with the thermal regime experienced by each species in its respective typical habitat. Sim-ulations {{of the effects of}} variation in mean habitat ambient temperature on egg production demonstrated that known distributional limits for T. bifidus correspond to thermal conditions that reduce <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> by only about 5 - 10 % rel-ative to long-term means at the study site. The same is true for C. valvata only in lower-ambient temperature habitats. In higher-temperature habitats, C. valvata exhibits an unusual plasticity in the timing of adult activity and reproduction that allows it to occupy a much wider geographic range than T. bifidus. Contrary to expectations, frequency distributions of predicted <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rates were negatively skewed in each species ' respective 'typical habitat', and Gaussian only in thermally marginal habitats.

40|$|Observed {{fluctuations}} in relative fecundity of Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua L.) {{were related to}} food availability during the main feeding period and were used to develop a predictive model that explained 72 % of the interannual variations in fecundity. Time series of sex ratios, maturity ogives, and relative fecundity were combined with mean weights-at-age and stock sizes from an analytical multispecies model to estimate the potential <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (PEP). Relationships between PEP and independent estimates of realized <b>daily</b> and seasonal <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> from <b>egg</b> surveys were highly significant. The difference between estimates of potential and realized seasonal <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> was of a magnitude corresponding to the expected loss of eggs {{as a result of}} atresia, fertilization failure, and early egg mortality. The removal of interannual variability in sex ratio, maturity, and fecundity on estimates of PEP deteriorated the relationships in all three cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} an environmentally induced forced molt on concentrations of plasma progesterone (P), corticosteroids (CS), corticosterone binding globulin binding capacity (CBGgc), and liver corticosteroids (LCS) during early forced molt. Laying hens were placed into two environmental control chambers. In one chamber, control (C) hens were fed ad libitum and maintained on long photoperiods of 19 hr of light <b>daily</b> to maintain <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> In the other chamber, early forced-molt (EM) hens were exposed to short photo-periods of 6 hr of light <b>daily</b> to decrease <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> After 2 weeks of ad libitum feeding, feed was withdrawn from the EM hens for 2 days to initiate a molt. Feed was restored for 3 days to the EM hens before hens from both groups were sacrificed every 2 hr for 2 days. The EM hens had regressed ovaries, greater body weight losses, lower plasma P and CS hormone levels, lower nuclei free LCS levels, and lower CBGgc than C hens. Nuclear LCS levels were similar in EM and C hens. A single peak indicating a daily rhythm of plasma P was found only in C hens. Progesterone secretions appeared to be eposodic in EM hens. A daily rhythm with two peaks of plasma CS and nuclei-free LCS was found in the C hens. Nuclear LCS peaked thrice daily in C hens. A cascade of CS from the plasma to the liver cytosol and on to the liver nucleus was indicated. Plasma CS was negatively correlated with nuclei-free LCS. Two daily peaks of plasma CS occurred in EM hens. One peak exhibited a daily rhythm and the other did not. Daily rhythmic peaks in EM hens were less defined than in C hens. Force molt treatment in EM hens may have affected the loss of the LCS peaks as was found in the C hens. No daily rhythms of CBGgc were found in either hen group.

40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{estimating}} <b>daily,</b> in situ <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rate for Calanus pacificus, a planktonic marine copepod that releases its eggs {{directly into the}} sea, were developed. The model for both methods separates <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rate into <b>daily</b> frequency of spawning (% day-‘) and clutch size (eggs female-l). One method involves direct observations of spawning frequency and clutch size in {{a random sample of}} females held in controlled conditions for a 12 - 24 -h period immediately after capture. The second method involves a visual assessment of the ovaries of live or preserved females and uses the observation that egg laying in Calanus occurs at night to predict daily rates of spawning. The methods were used {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> rate and phytoplankton availability in two areas of Puget Sound with different seasonal patterns of phy-toplankton abundance and size composition. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> rate was hyperbolically related to phytoplankton concentration.

The life history of copepods in the genus Calanus appears to be well suited for effec-tive utilization of the seasonal phytoplank-ton production in temperate oceans. Late preadult stages spend the winter in dia-pause, thus enduring the scarcity of food resources.

40|$|Quantitative {{expressions}} {{are presented}} describing the potential reproductive rate per individual female of Pseudocalanus spp. {{in several different}} waters (not reduced by food limitation) {{as a function of}} both temperature and cephalothorax length of females (one equation for each studied region). The calculations were made for some geographically separate populations of Pseudocalanus spp. from southwest Baffin Island, Nova Scotia, Long Island Sound, Scotland, as well as the southern North Sea and its adjacent waters (e. g. the English Channel). On the basis of the findings presented in this work and from other studies, the reproductive rate was computed as the mean number of eggs per sac divided by 1. 25 times the embryonic duration at the given temperature. Also computed was the amount of egg matter produced per day as a percentage of body carbon (and dry weight) of female weight for all localities. The relationships for females from the southern North Sea were obtained for "viable eggs", but they should be treated with reserve. A more suitable expression describing <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in the southern North Sea is the equation for females from the English Channel obtained here.

The {{present study}} evaluates the {{suitability}} of the <b>Daily</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>Production</b> Method (DEPM) for stock assessment of blue mackerel, Scomber australasicus and assesses methodological options for future applications. In southern Australia, estimates of mean <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> were higher for CalifornianVertical EggTow (CalVET) nets than bongo nets, and in easternAustralia, were higher in October 2003 than July 2004. Estimates of spawning area for southernAustralia were three times higher for bongo nets than CalVET nets. Similar estimates of spawning area were obtained using standard (manual) gridding and natural neighbour methods. Large samples and reliable estimates of all adult parameters were obtained for southern Australia. Relatively few spawning adults were collected off eastern Australia. Preliminary best estimates of spawning biomass for southern and eastern Australia were 56 228 t and 29 578 t, respectively, with most estimates within the ranges of 45 000 – 68 000 t and 20 000 – 40 000 t respectively. The DEPM is suitable for stock assessment of S. australasicus. Several technical refinements are required to enhance future applications, including: genetic techniques for identifying early stage eggs; a temperature–egg development key; improved methods for sampling adults off eastern Australia; and measurements of the degeneration rates of post-ovulatory follicles at several temperatures...|$|E

Three equations were developed from the {{feeding experiment}} to predict ME needs for breeders: Eq. 1 : (ME = BW 0. 75 [111. 9 - 0. 46 T] + 5. 8 G + 2. 3 EM); Eq. 2 : (ME = BW 0. 75 [110. 3 - 0. 47 T + 0. 055 (T - 22. 5) 2] + 5. 8 G + 2. 3 EM); Eq. 3 : (ME = BW 0. 75 [111. 02 - 0. 49 T + 0. 049 (T - 22. 07) 2] + BWΔ (1 / 0. 77 x ERf + 1 / 0. 37 x ERp) + ECE/ 0. 73 x EM), where ME = Metabolizable Energy (kcal), BW = Body Weight (kg 0. 75), T = Temperature (°C), BWΔ = Body Weight change (g/d), ERf = Energy Retained as fat (kcal), ERp = Energy Retained as protein (kcal); ECE = Energy Content of Eggs (kcal/g) and EM = Egg Mass (g) ...|$|R

Four hundred and thirty two, ISA Brown hens at sixty six weeks of age after molt induction were fed six experimental diets containing three ME (2, 750, 2, 800, 2, 850 kcal/kg) with two CP (15, 17 %) levels in a factorial design. The influence of ME and CP were evaluated on <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> <b>egg</b> weight and feed intake throughout 24 weeks of <b>production.</b> <b>Egg</b> mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were measured during the experimental period. Haugh unit, yolk color and eggshell breaking strength were measured at 5 %, 50 %, peak, post peak and end stage of <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The hens fed 2800 kcal/kg diet along with 15 % CP recorded the highest outcome of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (P< 0. 05). The egg weight {{has been shown to}} increase with hens receiving 2, 800 kcal/kg ME. <b>Daily</b> <b>egg</b> mass tended to increase in hens fed with 15 % CP and 2, 800 kcal/kg ME.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the interaction of types of maize (Provitamin A-biofortified maize (PABM) versus white maize) and strain of laying birds (Amberlink and Hyline) on nutritional quality of eggs. Twenty-one of each of Amberlink and Hyline laying hens were fed on three diets for 30 days. Birds were distributed in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement constituting three diets (0, 50 or 100 % of PABM) and two strains (Amberlink & Hyline). There was a diet × strain interaction on egg shell weight, average <b>daily</b> feed intake, <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> <b>egg</b> weight and egg shell thickness. Eggs produced by layers under 100 % PABM had lighter eggshell weight and lower eggshell percentage. In contrast, eggs produced by layers under 50 % PABM diet had signi-ficantly higher eggshell percentage, heavier egg shell weight and thicker eggshell. As the level of PABM increased, the yellow and red hue (Hunter a* and b* values) significantly increased while the lightness values (Hunter L* values) decreased. As the level of PABM in the ration increased, the vitamin A content of the egg yolk also significantly increased. Assimilation of vitamin A from feed to egg yolk in Amberlink and Hyline hens was similar. Hence, egg enrichment with vitamin A can be achieved by using PABM in layers ration. The use of high level of PABM had a negative effect on the eggshell quality traits...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLimited {{empirical}} studies have elucidated the <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and associated reproductive processes of egg bearing copepod. Herein, we present an individual-based model which constitutes a realistic {{representation of the}} reproduction in egg bearing copepods. The model has been parameterized using an extensive set of experimental data obtained from the literature and from the laboratory and field experiments on the estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis. The proposed model {{takes into account the}} adult female longevity, the clutch size and interclutch duration, which is a function of egg maturation time and latency time required by the female after egg hatching to produce a new clutch. The embryonic development time and hatching success are also taken into account. The effect of temperature on the means and variances of above-mentioned reproductive parameters has been also incorporated. A multi agent system based generic platform "Mobidyc" has been used to generate and calibrate the model. The model demonstrates the reproductive parameters of females of E. affinis which is validated through individual based experiments. Temperature specific simulations provide a dynamical explanation of temperature effect on the cumulative egg production. The daily survival principally affects the number of clutches produced per female during its life span. The results obtained in the present study by combining temperature and survival effects reveal the relatively greater importance of the first factor on the <b>daily</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> of egg-carrying copepods. The present model is generic and hence easily applicable to other animals with comparable reproductive strategy...|$|E
