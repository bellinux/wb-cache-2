5|$|On October 14, 1990, United Airlines {{became the}} 777's launch {{customer}} when it placed {{an order for}} 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11billion with options on an additional 34. The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s. United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes. In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|MSN1813 {{will test}} natural icing, assess <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> {{conditions}} in the United Arab Emirates and La Paz and fly 150h of route-proving; it will have rakes and pressure sensors in the engine flows to compare actual thrust with ground bench measurements.|$|E
50|$|Climate: Subtropical, <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> humid. <b>High</b> of 36°C (97°F) and low of 23°C (73°F).|$|R
5000|$|The UH-1H {{aircraft}} {{were significantly}} modified to meet CAL FIRE’s specialized needs. The modified helicopters were designated as [...] "Super Hueys". The Super Huey sported a larger, more powerful engine, transmission and rotor system. The tail boom and tail rotor were also modified {{to accommodate the}} engine, giving the aircraft greater performance than the standard U.S. Army UH-1H helicopters in <b>hotter</b> <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> conditions typical of California.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having an}} annual {{precipitation}} of 752 mm, Apatzingán has a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification Bsh) {{due to its}} <b>hot</b> temperatures <b>and</b> <b>high</b> evaporation rates.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} Tudor II G-AGSU first flew on 10 March 1946 at Woodford Aerodrome. The {{changes in}} design had however {{resulted in a}} loss of performance and the aircraft could not be used in <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> conditions which resulted in Qantas ordering the Constellation and South African Airways, the Douglas DC-4 instead, with the total order reduced to 50.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 1962, the S-61N {{made its}} first flight. Otherwise {{identical}} to the S-61L, this version is optimized for overwater operations, particularly oil rig support, by retaining the SH-3's floats. Both the S-61L and S-61N were subsequently updated to Mk II standard with improvements including more powerful CT58-110 engines giving better <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> performance, vibration damping and other detail refinements.|$|E
25|$|The UTTAS {{requirements}} for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs resulted in {{features such as}} dual-engines with improved <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); crashworthy crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, crashworthy fuel system.|$|E
5000|$|Aeronautics was Wenham's [...] "spare time" [...] pursuit. In {{his regular}} career he {{designed}} marine engines, ship's propellers, gas <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> air engines, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> pressure boilers.|$|R
5000|$|Culiacán has a {{semiarid}} climate (Köppen: BSh), despite {{receiving an}} annual rainfall over 600 mm, {{due to its}} <b>hot</b> temperatures <b>and</b> <b>high</b> evaporation. Summers are very <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> humid, shade temperatures can reach 45 C <b>and</b> <b>high</b> humidity can produce heat indices of 50 to 55 C, with the risk of heavy rainfall from decaying tropical cyclones also present. Winters are much milder with less humidity <b>and</b> an average <b>high</b> of 27 °C, with warm nights.|$|R
50|$|Maceió has {{a typical}} {{tropical}} climate, specifically a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am), with warm to <b>hot</b> temperatures <b>and</b> <b>high</b> relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and trade winds blowing from the ocean.|$|R
25|$|Early on, the {{decision}} to adopt four engines for a feeder airliner rather than two was viewed as atypical by some commentators. Advantages of adopting the four engine configuration include greater redundancy and superior takeoff performance from short runways, {{as well as in}} <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> conditions. Electrical power is primarily provided by generators located on each of the outboard engines. For ease of maintenance and reduced operator costs, the ALF 502 is of a modular design and makes minimum use of specialist tooling.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and the main rotor features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the shrouded tail rotor has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the main rotor blades, and the shrouded tail rotor purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|Five more 500s were {{subsequently}} built— one at Cardington, two in Toronto, one in Tokyo, {{and one in}} the United States. The ships were mainly used in advertising and filming. Other uses of the craft included sightseeing flights over London, a trial shuttle service between Paris's Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports and trials with NASA and the United States Air Force, United States Navy and United States Coast Guard. Four 500s were later upgraded to 500HL standards by mating the 500 gondola to a 600 envelope in order to increase lift for heavy payloads or <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> applications. Two more 500 gondolas were begun but never completed.|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} a warm {{tropical}} climate with mild winters, <b>hot</b> summers <b>and</b> <b>high</b> rainfall.Through {{most of its}} length the Ribeira de Iguape flows through relatively under-populated agricultural country with large areas of Atlantic Forest.However, the river has been degraded by human activities and deforestation is continuing.|$|R

500|$|The Comet 1 {{featured}} [...] de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1 turbojet engines. Two hydrogen peroxide-powered de Havilland Sprite booster rockets {{were originally}} intended to be installed to boost takeoff under <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> altitude conditions from airports such as Khartoum and Nairobi. These were tested on 30 flights, but the Ghosts alone were considered powerful enough and some airlines concluded that rocket motors were impractical. Sprite fittings were retained on production aircraft. Comet 1s subsequently received more powerful [...] Ghost DGT3 series engines.|$|E
500|$|Port Sudan {{was removed}} from the list of {{destinations}} on [...] The airline had its first fatal accident on 15 July when a DC-3 crashed en route from Bulchi to Jimma, killing the pilot. A Convair 240 was sold to Allied Stores of Israel on 18 July. On 12 August, an order with Boeing for two Boeing 720B aircraft was placed. EAL general manager had already brought the idea of acquiring two jet aircraft for long-haul operations up already in , suggesting the Boeing 720B. The Sud SE-210 Caravelle, the de Havilland D.H.106 Comet 4 and the Boeing 720B were all taken into account. <b>Hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> condition of some EAL operations made the Caravelle inappropriate, whereas the Comet was considered obsolete. The first East–West link made by an African airline started on 8 November, when the Addis Ababa–Accra–Lagos–Monrovia route was launched using DC-6B equipment.|$|E
500|$|The 757 was {{intended}} to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727. The focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs, which had grown amid rising oil prices during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Design targets included a 20percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines, plus an additional 10percent from aerodynamic improvements, versus preceding aircraft. Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) was set at , which was [...] more than the 727. The 757's higher power-to-weight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> climates, offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft. [...] Competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations, with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air. [...] Boeing also offered options for higher payload capability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of normal <b>hot</b> rolling <b>and</b> <b>high</b> rate cooling (NHR+HRC) on {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of the rolled EH 36 hull plate. Double-hit tests were carried out to study the effect of process parameters such as the deformation temperature and soaking time on microstructures of the tested steel, and explore optimal processing parameters. Single-hit compression with various parameters was developed and the microstructures of the tested steel are analyzed to determine the cooling rate and the final cooling temperature of the normal <b>hot</b> rolling <b>and</b> <b>high</b> rate cooling. This study will provide experimental and theoretical base on high-temperature rolling control system. Industrial trial was performed to produce regular products. The {{results show that the}} NHR+HRC is an effective and promising method to improve the product quality of high-strength hull plate...|$|R
50|$|There is some {{variation}} in both rainfall throughout Eastern Washington. Generally, lower elevations are both <b>hotter</b> <b>and</b> drier than <b>higher</b> elevations. This is easily {{seen in the}} comparison between low-elevation Richland with higher elevation Spokane.|$|R
50|$|Many {{parts of}} Australia, {{particularly}} southeastern Australia, {{have been in}} drought for the last 10-15 years. This has increased the fuel load potential by drying out vegetation, and increases the potential occurrence of <b>hot</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>high</b> wind combinations that precipitate extreme bushfire conditions. The drought has increased potential for extreme conditions throughout the last decade.|$|R
500|$|... "Wallace" [...] is a hip hop {{song that}} lasts for a {{duration}} of three minute and fifty seconds, with R influences and a [...] "pounding" [...] beat. Brennan Carley from Spin described the song as Banks [...] "float between islandy R and rapid-fire, corner-side spitting". Throughout December 2014, Banks released {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed '16 Days of Azealia'. During the commentary video for [...] "Wallace", Banks revealed that she first received the instrumental for the song in 2007, from DJ Skeet Skeet. According to Banks, the instrumental was unused {{for a period of}} time, until she decided that she only needed the most original material for her album, it was at this point in which she wrote the song. In an interview with Complex, Banks stated that the song is about [...] "being really <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> and horny".|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 Cantinieau was {{appointed}} {{as director of}} the Spanish company Aerotécnica's new helicopter division, which also acquired the rights to the MC-101 from Matra. [...] The Hirth engine was replaced with a more powerful [...] air-cooled flat four Lycoming O-320, in order to cope better with Madrid's <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> atmosphere, and the helicopter was renamed the Aerotécnica AC-11. [...] Further development led to the Aerotécnica AC-12 with an enclosed fuselage and cabin.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} {{distinctly}} subtropical. Winters are relatively dry, with minimum temperatures reaching -5 C, and strong precipitations during autumn and spring. Summer is very <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> humid, with <b>highs</b> easily exceeding 45 C. Annual rainfall averages 1700 mm.|$|R

5000|$|Bombardino is a drink {{popular in}} Italy during the Winter, {{especially}} in the ski resorts. It is made by mixing 1/2 Advocaat or eggnog and 1/2 Brandy. It is served <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> with whipped cream on top. It has several variations: with coffee (calimero), with rum (pirata) or whisky (scozzese). The calimero variation is one part Brandy, one part Vov (an egg-based liqueur), and one part espresso. The Bombardino's name is supposedly derived from one of its first imbibers noting its <b>hot</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>high</b> alcohol <b>and</b> remarking (in Italian) [...] "It's like a bomb!".|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, AgustaWestland {{unveiled}} an AW139 variant with {{an increased}} gross weight of 7 tonnes, this enabling a range of 305km while carrying 12 passengers; existing AW139s can also be rebuilt to the newer heavy-weight model. The heavier airframe comes {{at the expense of}} decreased <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> performance however. In November 2015, AgustaWestland demonstrated a 60-minute [...] "run-dry" [...] test (no oil) of an AW139's main gearbox, 30 minutes greater than any other certified rotorcraft at the time.|$|E
2500|$|A factory {{engineered}} {{and supported}} upgrade first flown May 2012. The conversion features new avionics, interior, winglets, and Williams FJ44-4A-32 engines. The first fully configured was delivered on July 20, 2017, the upgrade {{can be performed}} in 12 weeks {{with a choice of}} Rockwell Collins Pro Line 4 to 21 or Garmin G5000 avionics, it provides 33% more range to [...] with four passengers, better <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> performance and a 19 min climb to FL450 at max takeoff weight.|$|E
2500|$|As a clean-sheet design, the SH09 adopted several modern features, {{including}} an airframe that is entirely composed of carbon composite materials, a shrouded fenestron tail rotor, and a high-visibility cockpit. The use of carbon composites {{is a key}} feature of the aircraft, which has been credited with enabling the high volume cabin to be adopted without incurring too much weight; according to Mathias Senes, Marenco's chief commercial officer: [...] "There’s no other material today that brings the benefits of rigidity, strength, and light weight". According to Stucki, the rotorcraft is designed around the perspective of pilots and this has driven many design attributes, principally those involving the cabin, to improve ergonomics, comfort, and operator requirements overall. In terms of flying capabilities, it possesses excellent <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> performance, lengthy flight endurance, a low noise signature, and has relatively smooth handling.|$|E
