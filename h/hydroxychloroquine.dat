25|$|Disease-modifying {{antirheumatic}} drugs (DMARDs) {{are used}} preventively {{to reduce the}} incidence of flares, the progress of the disease, and the need for steroid use; when flares occur, they are treated with corticosteroids. DMARDs commonly in use are antimalarials such as <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> and immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate and azathioprine). <b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations. <b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> has relatively few side effects, and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have SLE.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{affects the}} {{metabolism}} of methadone, sometimes resulting in higher blood levels {{and a higher}} incidence of side effects, and may interact with the antimalarial medication <b>hydroxychloroquine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, <b>hydroxychloroquine,</b> sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> was {{approved}} by the FDA for lupus in 1955. Some drugs approved for other diseases are used for SLE 'off-label'. In November 2010, an FDA advisory panel recommended approving belimumab (Benlysta) as a treatment for the pain and flare-ups common in lupus. The drug {{was approved}} by the FDA in March 2011.|$|E
25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant persons with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} SLE. Treatments may include NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, <b>hydroxychloroquine,</b> and methotrexate. Alternative {{medicine}} has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly {{increases the risk of}} cardiovascular disease with this being {{the most common cause of}} death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone. If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need {{to remain on}} steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, <b>hydroxychloroquine,</b> cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{may be used}} {{to treat}} musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate may be helpful. <b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, hair loss, stomach aches/cramps, headache, liver toxicity, and increased risk of infections. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop cancer later.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may {{be helped by}} balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, {{or the use of}} assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence.|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> {{has similar}} {{pharmacokinetics}} to chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and elimination by the kidneys. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5) metabolize <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> to N-desethylhydroxychloroquine.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has been}} {{successful}} in establishing the role of <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> in metabolic disorders [...] {{and for the first time}} in the world, <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> has been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in India.|$|E

5000|$|Drugs {{including}} finasteride, etizolam (and benzodiazepines), chloroquine, <b>hydroxychloroquine,</b> oestrogen, penicillin and amitriptyline.|$|E
50|$|Toxicity from <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> {{may be seen}} in two {{distinct}} areas of the eye: the cornea and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of <b>hydroxychloroquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{of acute}} Q fever with {{antibiotics}} is very effective {{and should be}} given in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist. Commonly used antibiotics include doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and <b>hydroxychloroquine.</b> Chronic Q fever {{is more difficult to}} treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and quinolones or doxycycline with <b>hydroxychloroquine.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> {{increases}} lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells. In inflammatory conditions, it blocks toll-like receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9), which recognizes DNA-containing immune complexes, {{leads to}} the production of interferon and causes the dendritic cells to mature and present antigen to T cells. <b>Hydroxychloroquine,</b> by decreasing TLR signaling, reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> treats malaria, {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus, rheumatic disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, Q fever.|$|E

Mycophenolic acid is also used for treatment of lupus nephritis, but it is not FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women.|$|E
50|$|Ursodeoxycholic acid {{has been}} used {{successfully}} {{as a treatment for}} cases with liver involvement. Thalidomide has also been tried successfully as a treatment for treatment-resistant lupus pernio in a clinical trial, which may stem from its anti-TNF activity, although it failed to exhibit any efficacy in a pulmonary sarcoidosis clinical trial. Cutaneous disease may be successfully managed with antimalarials (such as chloroquine and <b>hydroxychloroquine)</b> and the tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline. Antimalarials have also demonstrated efficacy in treating sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia and neurosarcoidosis. Long-term use of antimalarials is limited, however, by their potential to cause irreversible blindness and hence the need for regular ophthalmologic screening. This toxicity is usually less of a problem with <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> than with chloroquine, although <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> can disturb the glucose homeostasis.|$|E
50|$|Most {{patients}} are routinely given 400 mg of <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> daily (or 250 mg chloroquine). This dose is considered acceptable.|$|E
50|$|Some {{antimalarial}} agents, particularly chloroquine and <b>hydroxychloroquine,</b> {{are also}} used {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and lupus-associated arthritis.|$|E

50|$|Treatment/management of nephritis {{depends on}} what has {{provoked}} the inflammation of the kidney(s). In the case of lupus nephritis, <b>hydroxychloroquine</b> could be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> {{generally}} {{does not}} have significant interactions with other medications, but care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (Tagamet) or digoxin (Lanoxin). HCQ can increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which {{may contribute to the}} development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of HCQ. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of <b>hydroxychloroquine.</b>|$|E
