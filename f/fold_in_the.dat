5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E

5|$|The column or trunk is {{generally}} {{more or less}} cylindrical and may be plain and smooth or may bear specialist structures; these include solid papillae (fleshy protuberances), adhesive papillae, cinclides (slits) and small protruding vesicles. In some species the part immediately below the oral disc is constricted and {{is known as the}} capitulum. When the animal contracts, the oral disc, tentacles and capitulum fold inside the pharynx and are held in place by a strong sphincter muscle part way up the column. There may be a <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body wall, known as a parapet, at this point, and this parapet covers and protects the anemone when it is retracted.|$|E

While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out {{to either side}} and, {{with the support of}} several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E

25|$|Lukina jama–Trojama also {{contains}} a second yet undescribed species of Zospeum, also recovered by the 2012 expedition. It can be distinguished from Zospeum tholussum by its general shell shape, a more prominent <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shell central column, {{the absence of the}} dome-like structure on the second whorl, and the presence of a tooth. However, no living specimens of this species were recovered, so DNA barcodes could not be obtained to determine its exact taxonomic relationship with Zospeum tholussum.|$|E

There are, however, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals that are appreciably {{different}} than those of Twelver Shias in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon. In particular, much of mystical language in the Alevi tradition is inspired by Sufi traditions. Some sources link Alevism in particular to the heterodox syncretic Sufi group known as the Bektashi Order, which was Sunni.|$|E
25|$|The stings are {{not part}} of a {{deliberate}} attack, but are mainly the result of brushing against the spines. However, many species whose larvae are armed with such hairs have behavioral patterns adapted to present the urticating hairs as a defensive threat and to inflict them on any perceived attackers. For example, many larvae in the family Lasiocampidae bear dense bands of short stinging hairs across their thoracic segments. The hairs are normally retracted into a shallow <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin, but if the caterpillar is disturbed, it everts the folds and displays the hairs, which are usually of a contrasting color.|$|E

25|$|Historians and anthropologists {{differ on}} issue of Gurjar origin. According to one view, Gurjars came from central Asia via Georgia from near the Caspian Sea; that Sea's {{alternate}} {{name of the}} Bahr-e-Khizar caused the tribe {{to be known as}} Khizar, Guzar, Gujur, Gurjara, or Gujjar. According to this view, Gurjars came in multiple waves of migration and they were initially accorded status as high-caste warriors in the Hindu <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North-Western regions (modern Rajasthan and Gujarat). Aydogdy Kurbanov states that some Gurjars, along with people from northwestern India, merged with the Hephthalites to become the Rajput clan.|$|E
25|$|Antithrombin inactivates its {{physiological}} target enzymes, Thrombin, Factor Xa and Factor IXa with rate constants of 7–11 x 103, 2.5 x 103 M−1 s−1 and 1 x 10 M−1 s−1 respectively. The rate of antithrombin-thrombin inactivation {{increases to}} 1.5 - 4 x 107 M−1 s−1 {{in the presence}} of heparin, i.e. the reaction is accelerated 2000-4000 fold. Factor Xa inhibition is accelerated by only 500 to 1000 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of heparin and the maximal rate constant is 10 fold lower than that of thrombin inhibition. The rate enhancement of antithrombin-Factor IXa inhibition shows an approximate 1 million fold enhancement {{in the presence of}} heparin and physiological levels of calcium.|$|E
25|$|Homology {{includes}} a unique group of shared structures {{referred to as}} vestigial structures. Vestigial refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them. These apparently illogical structures are remnants of organs that {{played an important role}} in ancestral forms. Such is the case in whales, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of their ancestors which walked on land. Humans also have vestigial structures, including the ear muscles, the wisdom teeth, the appendix, the tail bone, body hair (including goose bumps), and the semilunar <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner of the eye.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{position}} in a <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham {{was one of the}} last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking their TV reception from the Chesham transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials– they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 & Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.|$|E
25|$|The surgeon effects a stab {{incision}} {{just above}} the lateral aspect of the inframammary fold (IMF), piercing the skin 2-cm above the inframammary <b>fold,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midline. The pre-tunnelling is performed with the blunt-tip, multi-perforation cannula used to infiltrate the anaesthetic solution to the breast tissues. A blunt-tip, 4-mm cannula, connected either to a medical-grade vacuum pump or to a syringe, is used to aspirate (suck) the adipose fat. The cannula is maneuvered laterally (in fanning movements), beginning in the deep plane of the breast and concluding in the superficial plane of the breast; the adipose fat sucked from the breast is a yellow, fatty, bloodless fluid; the liposuction concludes upon drawing the required volume of fat, or when the fat becomes bloody.|$|E
25|$|Weigand {{identified}} Zospeum tholussum as a {{new species}} based on the morphology of the shells as well as molecular genetic data recovered from the single living specimen. The DNA barcode of the Zospeum tholussum holotype, when compared with other DNA barcodes of Zospeum species, shows its lowest interspecific genetic distance to Zospeum pretneri. This result is well above the barcoding gap of 3.2% for Carychiinae, which is suitable to separate between species (> 3.2%, interspecific) and within species genetic diversity (< 3.2%, intraspecific) in Zospeum. Zospeum tholussum closely resemble Zospeum amoenum morphologically, but can be readily distinguished by the dome-like shape of their second whorls and {{by the presence of}} a slight <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central column of the shells. They can also be readily separated by means of their DNA barcodes (11.7% to 12.1% genetic -distance between the two species).|$|E
