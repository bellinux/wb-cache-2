Their son, Pataki's father, was Louis P. Pataki (1912–1996), a mailman and volunteer fire chief, who ran the Pataki Farm. Pataki's maternal grandfather was Matteo Laganà (born in Calabria, Italy in 1889), who married Agnes Lynch of County Louth, Ireland around 1914. Their daughter, Margaret Lagana, is Pataki's mother. Pataki has an older brother, Louis. George Pataki can still speak a little Hungarian today, as well as Spanish, French, and German.|$|E

60|$|Eastport, on {{the other}} hand, was booming. It had two <b>hat</b> <b>factories,</b> three planing mills, a {{furniture}} works and a foundry. There were several blocks of stores, lit up at night by electric lights, and several hundred houses. Real estate, too, was advancing rapidly.|$|R
25|$|During the 1840s, {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last <b>hat</b> <b>factory</b> in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Six {{factories}} {{were located}} in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. [...] The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. [...] From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International <b>Hat</b> <b>factory</b> also served as {{the headquarters of the}} company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri. [...] The other factories in Missouri {{were located in}} Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran. [...] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946. [...] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968. [...] It eventually closed in 1984. [...] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees. [...] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco. [...] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972. [...] The facility employed approximately 300 workers. [...] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Unionization never proved {{popular with}} the {{employees}} or {{the culture of the}} company. [...] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed. [...] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act. [...] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International <b>Hat</b> <b>factory</b> in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union. [...] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee. [...] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote. [...] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982. [...] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later. [...] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1892, the {{industry}} was revolutionized when the large hat factories began to shift to manufacturing unfinished hat bodies only, and supplying them to smaller hat shops for finishing. So while Danbury produced 24% of America's hats in 1904, the city supplied {{the industry}} with 75% of its hat bodies. [...] The {{turn of the century}} was the heyday of the hatting industry in Danbury, when it became known as the [...] "Hat City" [...] and the [...] "Hatting Capitol of the World". Its motto was [...] "Danbury Crowns Them All". But by the 1920s, the hat industry was in decline. By 1923, only six manufacturers were left in Danbury, which increased the pressure on workers. After WWII, returning GI's went hatless, a trend that accelerated through the 1950s, dooming the city's hat industry. The city's last major <b>hat</b> <b>factory,</b> owned by Stetson, closed in 1964. The last hat was made in Danbury in 1987 when a small factory owned by Stetson closed.|$|E

50|$|Danbury's {{fortunes}} {{changed after}} World War II. Americans, particularly men, began wearing hats less frequently, forcing cutbacks or closings at the <b>hat</b> <b>factories.</b> In 1955, the flooding of the Still that followed hurricanes Connie, Diane and Ione badly damaged many businesses, {{particularly in the}} Wooster Square and White Street areas. In their wake {{some of the first}} preservation efforts began.

60|$|Westville {{had always}} been a {{backward}} town, due mostly to the short-sightedness of Squire Paget, Mr. Hooker, the postmaster, and other narrow-minded leading men, who never saw fit to offer any inducements to manufacturers and others to locate there.

50|$|In the mid-20th {{century the}} area began to decline. Hats became less popular after World War II, causing the <b>hat</b> <b>factories</b> to close. The floods of 1955 took a toll, with some {{businesses}} {{choosing not to}} rebuild. Other businesses left later for a new shopping mall elsewhere in the city. Main Street was largely spared the demolition that accompanied urban renewal elsewhere in the country, and it was recognized as the city's only historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Its contributing properties, ranging from the 1780s to the 1930s, reflects a diversity of uses and styles with a heavy concentration of the Italianate commercial architecture of the late 19th century.|$|R
