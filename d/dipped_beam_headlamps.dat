50|$|Sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. Halogen sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of sealed beam construction; eventually halogen sealed beams came to dominate the sealed beam lamp market.|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated high <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> or the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high beam lamps on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R

5000|$|In many countries, every motorcycle's low <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> {{has been}} wired to {{illuminate}} whenever {{the engine is}} running, either {{as a matter of}} law or of voluntary industry practice. Some motorcycling advocacy groups are concerned over the potential for reduced motorcycle [...] with the introduction of headlamp-based DRLs on cars and other dual-track vehicles, since it means motorcycles are no longer the only vehicles displaying headlamps during the day. Some researchers have suggested that amber DRLs be reserved for use exclusively on motorcycles, in countries where amber is not presently a permissible color for DRLs on any vehicles, while other research has concluded there is a safety disbenefit to two 90 mm x 520 cd DRLs on motorcycles in comparison to one 190 mm x 270 cd <b>dipped</b> (low) <b>beam</b> headlight.

40|$|Incorporating {{safety in}} the design of a highway is one of the {{foremost}} duties of a design engineer. Design guidelines provide standards that help engineers include {{safety in the}} design of various geometric features. However, design guidelines are not frequently revised and do not accommodate for the frequent changes in vehicle design. One such example is the change in vehicle headlamps. These changes significantly impact the illuminance provided on the road and in turn the design formula. Roadway visibility is critical for nighttime driving. In the absence of roadway lighting, vehicle headlamps illuminate the road ahead of a vehicle. Sag vertical curve design depends on the available headlight sight distance provided by the 1 degree upward diverging <b>headlamp</b> <b>beam.</b> The sag curve design formulas were developed in the early 1940 s when sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were predominant. However, headlamps have changed significantly and modern headlamps project less light above the horizontal axis. In this research, the difference in illuminance provided by sealed <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> and modern headlamps was examined. For the theoretical analysis, three different sag curves were analyzed. On these curves, about 26 percent reduction in illuminance was observed at a distance equal to the stopping sight distance when comparing sealed <b>beam</b> to modern <b>headlamps.</b> A change in the headlamp divergence angle from 1. 0 degree to 0. 85 degree will provide the required illuminance on the road when using modern headlamps. A field study was performed to validate the theoretical calculations.

A significant reduction in illuminance reaching the roadway on sag curves was observed, due to headlamp lens degradation...|$|R
