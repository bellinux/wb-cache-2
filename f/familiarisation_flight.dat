500|$|In November 1943, Hannah was {{appointed}} {{commanding officer of}} No.6 Squadron at Milne Bay, Papua, flying Bristol Beaufort light bombers. During a <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flight</b> he came under friendly fire from anti-aircraft guns on Kiriwina Island, but avoided serious injury. He was raised to temporary group captain in December, and assumed command of No.71 Wing the following month. The Beauforts of No.6 Squadron and No.71 Wing {{took part in a}} series of major attacks on Rabaul, bombing and strafing airfields, infrastructure and shipping; this continued until February 1944, when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul. [...] The same month, Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia. After six weeks recuperation at Laverton, he returned to No.6 Squadron, based on Goodenough Island. From March to August, the squadron was mainly involved in convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. In September 1944, Hannah {{was appointed}} senior air staff officer (SASO) at Headquarters Western Area Command, Perth. He took over control of the formation from Air Commodore Raymond Brownell in July 1945, following Brownell's departure to command No.11 Group in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
500|$|On 27 June 1941, the Croatian Legion (...) {{was formed}} to fight {{alongside}} Germany during its invasion of the Soviet Union, and on 12 July the air component of the Legion was formed. Known as the Croatian Air Force Legion ( [...] , HZL) it consisted of a bomber group and a fighter group. The HZL formed part of the German Luftwaffe; its members swore an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler, were subject to German disciplinary regulations and wore Luftwaffe uniforms. After attending Luftwaffe training schools, the fighter group {{was sent to the}} Eastern Front and designated as 15. (Kroatische) Staffel (squadron) of III. Gruppe (Group) of Jagdgeschwader 52 (52nd Fighter Wing, or JG 52). Meanwhile, Dukovac was transferred to the Luftwaffe Flugzeugführerschüle A/B 120 (pilot school 120) in Prenzlau, Germany in September or October. In April 1942 he underwent advanced training, and in June he was transferred to Jagdfliegerschüle 4 (fighter pilot school 4) at Fürth. In October 1942, Leutnant Dukovac and seven other pilots joined 15./JG 52, which was operating in the Caucasus flying Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 fighters. On 29 October, Dukovac had his first 15-minute <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flight,</b> and by the afternoon of that day the new members of the unit were flying as wingmen to the veteran pilots of the Staffel.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1940, Waldmann {{graduated}} from school with his Abitur (diploma). After this he was accepted into the Luftwaffe, two years after his initial application. Commencing in July 1940, he undertook 12 weeks of basic military training with Fliegerausbildungsregiment 72 (72nd Flight Training Regiment) at Fels am Wagram in Austria. Upon completion, Waldmann {{was transferred to the}} Flugzeugführerschule A/B 72 (flight school for the pilot license) at Markersdorf near Sankt Pölten in early October 1940. Eight days later his training group returned to Fels am Wagram because Markersdorf was overcrowded with other flight courses. Thus flight training started on the improvised airfield without hangars at Fels am Wagram. His first <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flight</b> was on 16 October 1940, in a Bücker Bü 131 [...] "Jungmann" [...] biplane marked [...] "VTAF". Waldmann logged his first solo flight on 13 November 1940 at 09:17 in a Bü 131 [...] "CGNL", landing again after six minutes of flight time. His training group returned to Markersdorf in February 1941. From here, he conducted his first cross-country flights on the Bü 131 [...] "Jungmann" [...] as well as the Focke-Wulf Fw 44 [...] "Stieglitz". The majority of the cross-country flights were flown on the Gotha Go 145. From 4 April to 28 April 1941 he made the round trip from Markersdorf to Pocking, Nürnberg, Ettingshausen, Ingolstadt, Zwickau, Hildesheim, Braunschweig, Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Delmenhorst, Halberstadt and Fürth. At Ettingshausen he received instruction in formation flying and aerobatics.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, three {{production}} Su-27Ms {{were delivered}} to the air force's 929th State Flight-Test Centre (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team, and so the team's pilots took <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flights</b> with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team's Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003. However, they were used {{as a source of}} spare parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet.|$|R
25|$|No. 31 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Base Wagga on 14 August 1942 and was {{equipped}} with Bristol Beaufighter fighter and attack aircraft, {{the first of which}} was received on 23 August 1942. Under the command of Squadron Leader Charles Frederick Read, who later went on to serve as Chief of the Air Staff, the squadron undertook a period of training before deploying to Batchelor Airfield, Northern Territory, in October, the aircraft flying via Alice Springs. A period of more intense training followed and <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flights</b> were carried out before moving to its operational base at Coomalie Creek Airfield on 12 November and then began flying combat operations on 17 November, attacking targets in Portuguese Timor.|$|R

50|$|NZ5037 {{with its}} crew of FGOFF Alexander Moore and FSGT John Munro went missing on 11 February at Espiritu Santo {{on a radio}} range <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flight.</b> The {{aircraft}} went missing in the cloud covered hills around the area and despite extensive searches the wreckage was not found until 1987.|$|E
50|$|By {{the evening}} of 3 May 1942, the {{direction-finding}} station was back in working order, and Major de Wet briefed his crews on their first <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flight,</b> on which he would lead them early the following morning. The flight - to be made at a true air speed of 150 mph (242 km/hr) and intended to allow the crews {{to become familiar with}} landmarks in the area and to gain experience with desert flying - was to take off {{in the early hours of}} 4 May and follow roughly a square path, with its first leg one of 83 miles (134 km) from Kufra to Rebiana, Libya, on a course of 269°, followed by a second leg of 51.5 miles (83 km) on bearing 358° to Bzema, then a third leg of 64 miles (102 km) on bearing 63° to Landing Ground 07 (LG07), and finally on bearing 162° for the 83.5-mile (134-km) leg back to Kufra, with arrival at Kufra expected at 07:42 hours. In addition to its crew of three, each plane would carry a fourth man - an armourer - to assist with armament aboard the aircraft during the flight.|$|E
500|$|On arrival, Waldmann was {{approached}} by Hauptmann (Captain) Johannes Steinhoff and asked whether {{he would like to}} fly as his wingman. Waldmann then conducted six <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flights</b> on the [...] "Gustav", as the Bf-109G-2 was referred to, on 30 August 1942. Flying a Bf-109 marked with a black [...] "Chevron-2", indicating an aircraft of the Stab, he flew his first combat mission on 31 August 1942 in the vicinity of Stalingrad. Steinhoff was impressed by his first performance. At the time, Waldmann was still officially assigned to a transfer squadron, but Steinhoff decided to keep him in his Stabs-Schwarm, flight of four. Here his comrades nicknamed Waldmann [...] "Dackel", an allusion to his last name. In German, a [...] "Dackel", or Dachshund, is often named Waldi, a hypocoristic form of Waldmann.|$|R
25|$|No. 13 Squadron {{was formed}} from {{elements}} of No. 12 Squadron at RAAF Base Darwin on 1 June 1940. Its first commanding officer was Wing Commander John Balmer. The squadron initially operated Avro Ansons, {{serving in the}} general reconnaissance role and flew maritime surveillance patrols over the seas {{to the north of}} Australia and survey flights over northern Australia. The squadron was re-equipped with Lockheed Hudson light bombers, suffering its first loss in September when one aircraft was destroyed on take-off. In early 1941, the squadron was tasked with locating a German commerce raider and a U-boat, before joining the search for survivors from HMAS Sydney following its battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran. In May 1941, the squadron began flying <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flights</b> over the Netherlands East Indies in preparation to deploy to the NEI following the outbreak of war with Japan.|$|R
50|$|On 23 October 1974, {{the day of}} the new {{terminal}} pre-inauguration at West Berlin's Tegel Airport, Aeroamerica stationed its first Boeing 720 at Tegel for crew <b>familiarisation</b> <b>flights.</b> This aircraft was painted in a basic Braniff colour scheme modified with a white Air Club International style cheatline and a black Berliner Flug Ring inscription by the main door. By March 1975, a further two Boeing 720s arrived at the airline's new Berlin Tegel base to fulfill a five-year charter contract the company had concluded with Berliner Flugring, at the time West Berlin's leading package tour operator, to undertake a series of short- and medium-haul inclusive tour (IT) charter flights to the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands {{from the start of the}} 1975 summer season. Aeroamerica had taken over this contract from Modern Air. The decision to supply whole-plane charter airline seats to West Berlin's foremost package tour operator enabled the airline to take advantage of the fact that all airlines other than those headquartered in the US, the UK and France — the airlines of the three Western victorious powers of World War II — were banned from West Berlin.|$|R
