A total of 2033 specimens (983 male, 1021 female, 29 undetermined) showed the sex ratio m/f= 0. 96; females predominated. The total length (TL) of all observed specimens varied from 10. 0 to 32. 5 cm (mean±SD= 22. 0 ± 3. 65 cm). The age of <b>gilt</b> <b>sardine</b> varied from 0 + to 5 +. The values of natural (M), fishing (F), total mortality (Z) and survival rate (S) coefficients were M= 0. 46, F= 0. 23, Z= 0. 69 and S= 0. 60, respectively. Even though the catches of <b>gilt</b> <b>sardine</b> have not been recorded yet for the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea, as far as the world’s seas and oceans are concerned, the total catches were ca. 500 000 t in the last decade...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} by two parts, {{the first one}} treats {{the subject of the}} morphometric study of gill arch structure of the <b>gilt</b> <b>sardine,</b> Sardinella aurita. The size of the fishes is between 14 and 28 cm in total length. The results show that the number and width of gill rakers, gap between them and the length of gill arch increase linearly but at different rates with fish growth.

40|$|During {{the yearly}} ‘Ictio. Alborán-Cádiz’ (1994 – 1997) {{multidisciplinary}} oceanographic surveys, {{the eggs and}} larvae of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) are generally the dominant in the middle shelf ichthyoplankton community of the Gulf of Cádiz in summer. In the 1995 survey a notorius change have detected: the maximum localized abundance for ichthyoplanktonic components of <b>gilt</b> <b>sardine</b> (Sardinella aurita) have multiplied x 10 (eggs) and x 20 (larvae) the anchovy’s components. In this paper we discuss the observed changes in the hydrologic structure and in the larval fish and mesozooplankton assemblages (cluster analysis) ...|$|E
