40|$|Evaluation of the Monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> as a metric {{for fire}} weather {{in a region}} of complex terrain and {{uncertainties}} in future projections D. W. van der Kamp (University of British Columbia), G. Bürger (PCIC) and A. T. Werner (PCIC) Changes in both temperature and precipitation due to climate change will {{have a significant impact}} on future fire weather severity. The availability of a simple but skillful fire weather index would increase our ability to assess the magnitude and uncertainties of these impacts. We evaluated the Monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> as a metric for fire weather and generated a suite of future projections of the Monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> for regions throughout southeast British Columbia using statistical downscaling. Significant correlations between the Monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> calculated at five airport stations and annual area burned were found with a maximum R 2 of 0. 68. These results compare favourably to: its own input variables; more sophisticated models; and other fire weather indices. Reconstruction skill of the historical Monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> using statistical downscaling varied (R 2 = 0. 36 to 0. 72), with the best results at drier stations. A suite of future projections was created using six global climate models and three emission scenarios. Projected changes range from insignificant changes to increases, the latter suggesting important shifts in fire frequency. This range was primarily due to a large ensemble spread in precipitation projections across climate models. ...|$|E

Although different scales are used for each of the FWI elements, high values suggest more severe burning conditions (Taylor and Alexander 2006).|$|E

30|$|This example {{demonstrates}} {{how to calculate}} daily FWI system variables given a chronological dataset that consists of 2  years of daily fire weather observations from one weather station. The computation of the FWI system starts {{at the beginning of}} a fire season, which, in Canada, is when the snow is gone and the upper organic soil material has thawed. The <b>drought</b> <b>code</b> (DC), which tracks long-term moisture deficit, can be influenced by the value of the DC at the end of the previous season and the amount of precipitation received overwinter (Lawson and Armitage 2008) when calculations were not being carried out. Thus, the starting DC value in a new season can sometimes be significantly higher (indicating a drier forest floor) than the standard initial value (i.e., DC[*]=[*] 15), which represents soil moisture condition after about 3  days of springtime drying from full saturation. Because of the slowness of drying in this particular fuel layer, this starting difference can potentially bias the outputs of the FWI system over an entire fire season. When there is such a “carry-over” moisture deficit from season to season, the initial DC can be modified by a simple method (Lawson and Armitage 2008).|$|E

For trees between 60 and 100 years old, SOL thickness had no effect on the basal area increment (BAI) of spruce but showed a strong and negative correlation with BAI in aspen. Radial growth of black spruce was favored by higher precipitation in June of the previous growing season, higher temperatures in early winter and in spring, and by low temperatures in summer.

In this region, sixteen burned sites were measured for fermentation and humus layer thickness. These measurements were compared to those collected on an adjacent non-burned control site. Consumption was calculated to correlate with the numerical rating components of Duff Moisture Code (DMC), <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> (DC), Build-Up Index (BUI), and Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) of the overall Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS).

In particular, variation of fermentation layer consumption was most clearly associated with the DMC, humus layer consumption with the DC, and total (fermentation and humus) organic layer consumption with both the DC and the BUI. On sites where root exposure and tree mortality were noted, consumption of the organic layer was relatively high and the DMC and DC numerical ratings were categorized as extreme or high risks. Site characteristics, in particular microtopography and vegetation, were significant factors in accounting for the amount of consumption of these organic layers. The efficacy of the FWI fire risk ratings for indicating organic layer consumption was bolstered when coupled with these site characteristics.

40|$|Fire weather indices predict fire extent from {{meteorological}} conditions assuming a monotonic function; {{this approach is}} frequently used to predict future fire patterns under climate change scenarios using linear extrapolation. However, the relationship between weather and fire extent may potentially depend {{on the existence of}} fuel humidity thresholds above which this relationship changes dramatically, challenging this statistical approach. Here we combine the continuous and the threshold approaches to analyze satellite-detected fires in Europe during 2001 – 2010 in relation to {{meteorological conditions}}, showing that fire size response to increasing dryness follows a ramp function, i. e. with two plateaus separated by a phase of monotonic increase. This study confirms that at a continental and a high-resolution temporal scales, large fires are very unlikely to occur under moist conditions, but it also reveals that fire size stops to be controlled by fuel humidity above a given threshold of dryness. Thus, fuel humidity control only applies when fire is not limited by other factors such as fuel load, as large fires are virtually absent in dry regions with less than 500 mm of average annual rainfall, i. e. where fuel amount is insufficient. In regions with sufficient fuel, other factors such as fire suppression or fuel discontinuity can impede large fires even under very dry weather conditions. These findings are relevant under current climatic trends in which the fire season length, in terms of number of days with DC (<b>drought</b> <b>code)</b> values above the observed thresholds (break points), is increasing {{in many parts of the}} Mediterranean, while it is decreasing in Eastern Europe and remains unchanged in Central Europe...|$|E
40|$|The {{destructive}} {{nature of}} the [*]∼[*]  590   000  ha Horse river wildfire in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), northern Alberta, in May of 2016 motivated {{the investigation of the}} hydrometeorological conditions that preceded the fire. Historical climate and field hydrometeorological data from a moderate-rich fen watershed were used to (a)  identify whether the spring 2016 conditions were outside the range of natural variability for WBP climate cycles, (b)  explain the observed patterns in burn severity across the watershed, and (c)  identify whether fall and winter moisture signals observed in peatlands and lowland forests in the region are indicative of wildfire. Field hydrometeorological data from the fen watershed confirmed the presence of cumulative moisture deficits prior to the fire. Hydrogeological investigations highlighted the susceptibility of fen and upland areas to water table and soil moisture decline over rain-free periods (including winter), due to the watershed's reliance on supply from localized flow systems originating in topographic highs. Subtle changes in topographic position led to large changes in groundwater connectivity, leading to greater organic soil consumption by fire in wetland margins and at high elevations. The 2016 spring moisture conditions measured prior to the ignition of the fen watershed were not illustrated well by the <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> (DC) when standard overwintering procedures were applied. However, close agreement was found when default assumptions were replaced with measured duff soil moisture recharge and incorporated into the overwintering DC procedure. We conclude that accumulated moisture deficits dating back to the summer of 2015 led to the dry conditions that preceded the fire. The infrequent coinciding of several hydrometeorological conditions, including low autumn soil moisture, a modest snowpack, lack of spring precipitation, and high spring air temperatures and winds, ultimately led to the Horse river wildfire spreading widely and causing the observed burn patterns. Monitoring soil moisture at different land classes and watersheds would aid management strategies in the production of more accurate overwintered DC calculations, providing fire management agencies early warning signals ahead of severe spring wildfire seasons...|$|E
30|$|More recently, a large dataset of tree-ring width chronologies {{from across}} the country have been {{evaluated}} to develop multi-century, proxy-weather data, including the FWI’s mean monthly <b>Drought</b> <b>Code.</b> Based on recent burn area (Stocks et al. 2003), Girardin (2007) and Girardin and Sauchyn (2008) have extrapolated these data to derive an expected annual area burned for the past two centuries. This analysis shows that for the period 1781 to 1982, the weather conditions favoring large burn area was oscillatory with a mode of 26.7 yr. In order of magnitude, the three periods of predicted lowest annual area burn were 1796 to 1815, 1945 to 1969, and 1878 to 1906. Four periods of predicted highest annual area burned were 1781 to 1795, 1837 to 1849, 1907 to 1944, and most recently, 1970 to 1982 (Girardin 2007). There is spatial heterogeneity in area burned within North American ecozones within periods of years (Girardin and Sauchyn 2008), and at a circumboreal level for the actual spatio-temporal periodicity of the cycles themselves (Girardin et al. 2009). On the basis of correlation analysis, Girardin (2007 : Table 3) shows that for Canadian ecozones in which fire activity remains high (e.g., Taiga Plains, Taiga Shield, Boreal Shield West; Figures 1 and 5), the current observed burn area (1920 to 2005) has a reasonably strong relationship (r = 0.45 to 0.87) with North American land temperature records. However, burn area correlation to temperature is weaker (r = − 0.17 to 0.47) for the ecozones in which fire frequency has declined (e.g., Montane Cordillera, Prairies, Boreal Shield East). This suggests that other factors are influencing burn area in these ecozones. Similar results were obtained when instrumental weather records were used to calculate century-long monthly precipitation and FWI datasets for Banff National Park in the Montane Cordillera (White 1985, Fuenekes and Van Wagner 1995). Analysis of these data showed that the frequency of drought varies over time, but not in a directional manner. Burn area was historically dominated by human sources, has consistently declined over the decades, and has become increasingly unresponsive to weather periods favorable to fire ignition and growth. Historically, drought years consistently resulted in large fires; recently, they have not (White 1985, Van Wagner et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|AbstractTemperate peatlands {{represent}} a substantial store of carbon and their degradation is a potentially significant positive feedback to climate change. The ignition of peat deposits can cause smouldering wildfires {{that have the}} potential to release substantial amounts of carbon and to cause environmental damage from which ecosystem recovery can be slow. Direct estimates of the loss of carbon due to smouldering wildfires are needed to inform global estimates of the effect of wildfire on carbon dynamics and to aid with national emissions accounting. We surveyed the effect of a severe wildfire that burnt within an afforested peatland in the Scottish Highlands during the summer of 2006. The fire ignited layers of peat which continued to burn as a sub-surface smouldering wildfire {{for more than a month}} after the initial surface fire and despite several episodes of heavy rain. The smouldering fire perimeter enclosed an area of 4. 1 ha. Analysis of weather records showed that the fire coincided with unusually warm, dry conditions and a period when the Canadian Fire Weather Index system predicted both generally high danger conditions (high Fire Weather Index) and low fuel moisture content in deep organic soil layers (high <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> values). Remaining peat layers in the burn area had comparatively low fuel moisture contents of ca. 250 % dry weight. Within the smouldering fire’s perimeter, mean depth of burn was estimated at 17. 5 ± 2. 0 cm but ranged from 1 to 54 cm. Based on field measurements, our estimates suggested that, in total, the smouldering wildfire burnt 773 ± 120 t of organic matter corresponding to 396 ± 63 t of carbon and a carbon loss per unit area burnt of 96 ± 15 tha− 1 (9. 6 ± 1. 5 kgm− 2). This corresponds to between 0. 1 % and 0. 3 % of the estimated total amount of carbon sequestered annually by UK peatlands. Our results also provide circumstantial evidence that afforestation of peatland soils, and associated site preparation, may contribute to an increased risk of peat fires. Smouldering fires are difficult to detect using remotely sensing techniques due to their low temperature and low heat release and the fact that the tree canopy remains intact for months afterwards. If similar smouldering fires are underreported in other temperate, boreal and tropical peatland regions then emissions from peatland burning may well be a substantially greater issue than currently assumed...|$|E
40|$|Results {{from general}} {{circulation}} models {{suggest that the}} increase of forest fire activity at the global scale {{will be one of}} the impacts of climate change. As attention shifts to regional climate further spatial resolution is needed to handle the forcings and circulations that occur at smaller scales. One of the available techniques to assess the impact of climate change on fire activity at the regional scale is the dynamical downscaling between global climate models and regional models. In the present work, the impact of climate change on fire danger at the regional scale was examined by means of dynamical downscaling between a general circulation model (MUGCM) and a regional meteorological model (MM 5). A Southern European country, Portugal, was selected as case-study since general circulation models predict significant surface air temperature increases over Southern and Mediterranean Europe. Present and future climates, centred in 1990 and 2050, respectively, were obtained using,daily data previously simulated by MUGCM. Climate change signals on temperature and precipitation derived from the MUGCM ensemble simulations were analysed using spatial averages over the Iberian Peninsula and cluster analysis applied over Portugal. For the Iberian Peninsula, a positive trend for temperature for all seasons, with higher variability for the winter months, was obtained. Over Portugal, for the future climate, the average winter temperature is expected to be higher. Precipitation increases are,simulated for the end of autumn/beginning of winter, and negative changes are expected for the end of winter/beginning of spring and beginning of summer. The cluster analysis revealed important temporal changes on the meteorological variables which may be relevant for fire management planning, namely a longer fire season over Portugal is expected. The spatial refinement of the projected climate change impacts on the fire weather risk over Portugal was performed through numerical downscaling between MUGCM and MM 5. The MM 5 outputs, at 10 km resolution, were used to estimate the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) System components. Results show higher FWI values in the beginning of summer for the 2050 scenario. An increase of the maximum values of the <b>Drought</b> <b>Code</b> (DC) in the inner part of Portugal was also detected. An increase in the total area burned is anticipated, with the consequent increase of pollutants emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
