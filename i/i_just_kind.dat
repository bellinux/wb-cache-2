500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all sorts of stuff. It just kind of made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Araya {{described}} [...] "For this one, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of got {{inspired by}} watching TV. That {{gave me a}} whole lot of ideas. The whole idea about the dude with Slayer in his arms was brought about because reality is scarier than anything you can make up." [...] The production of the album posed as a challenge to the record company, [...] "how to market a group whose gore-soaked, extreme music is anathema to radio programmers." [...] It is the company's first attempt to [...] "hit the thrash band's core-audience of rabid enthusiasts with a fan-orientated marketing assault." [...] Araya related: [...] "We decided to take more time to bring this one together. We actually went into the studio with more written material than the past. We completed three out of seven songs outside the studio. We all sort of felt it was important to do it slowly. After the last tour, we had the intention to take the break." ...|$|E
500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{look for}} {{something}} interesting, something unique. The character should create some arc. It {{has to be very}} realistic. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> see what <b>kind</b> of human being my character is, and if I like it, I accept it," [...] Sharma said.|$|R
5000|$|Scaggs recalled: [...] "'Lido Shuffle' was a {{song that}} I'd been banging around.

Then I showed it to Paich and he helped me fill it out. It ended up being 'Lido Shuffle'." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ronald Reagan told {{journalist}} and presidential scholar Theodore White that [...] "There {{was a feeling}} that <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of a spokesman for John Sears." [...] Sears had been attempting to consolidate power in the Reagan campaign in 1980. He overstepped his bounds and was fired. William Casey was hired to take his place. Casey demanded administrative control of the campaign, but {{had no desire to}} control policy and by extension the personnel choices of the Reagan Administration—something John Sears was boldly attempting to control.|$|R
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupré began singing professionally when Jerry Cooper, a {{musician}} {{she was living}} with, heard her singing the Aretha Franklin version of the song [...] "Respect" [...] in the shower. [...] "She had this huge voice for such a little girl," [...] Cooper told MTV, [...] "and so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of went in and said, 'Hey, come upstairs when you're done with this, and let's work on some songs.'" [...] According to Dupré, she then toured and recorded with Cooper's band, networking {{with people in the}} music industry. In 2005, she formed a company named Pasche New York, an entertainment business intended to promote her music career.|$|E

5000|$|Meshuggah drummer Tomas Haake {{said of the}} EP, [...] "That whole {{track was}} written and {{recorded}} just on random. Me and Fredrik would just jam on something, and when we found something {{that was kind of}} cool, he would walk into the control room. <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> record drums and it wasn't a set pattern, <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of stray away from the pattern, but just keep going in that vibe. Then we had to chart everything and go bar by bar to record the guitars afterwards, because it's all just random." [...] Haake later commented that the song was [...] "originally recorded for Jason Popson's Fractured Transmitter record label" [...] and that it was a [...] "'one-off' that Nuclear Blast gave us the go-ahead for — as we were under contract with them." ...|$|R
2500|$|During an August 7, 2008, Rules Committee hearing after Daly had {{presented}} his resolution {{to turn the}} San Francisco Zoo into a rescue facility {{and when he was}} out of the room, a student from Lowell High School who had waited two hours for her chance to speak in support of the zoo, began to cry at the podium, because she, like the other speakers, was only allowed one minute to speak. [...] Normally at Board of Supervisors hearings, speakers have 23 minutes to speak, but time is limited by the discretion of the chair often to shorter periods of time, especially if there are a large number of speakers. [...] This was the second time the item had been heard in committee, and Chris Daly chose to limit public comment to one minute, so that another item regarding black flight from the City could be heard at that same hearing. Carl Friedman, the Director of the San Francisco Department of Animal Care and Control, said, [...] "There were a lot of young people there who have never been to a government meeting. For this to be their first experience was embarrassing." [...] When asked about the situation, the student responded, [...] "I didn't mean to cry, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of lost it. I thought they were supposed to listen to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is {{specifically}} about dealing with time apart in relationships and familial issues whilst on the road. The album's more serious tone {{has been attributed to}} the developing family life of the band (including new marriages and children). Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald explained that, [...] "Catalyst marked a move toward slightly more mature and serious material about relationships and life issues That lyrical direction is even more pronounced on Coming Home." [...] The band were particularly inspired by early Beatles records, seeing Chad Gilbert working on penning lyrics alongside Pundik and primary lyricist Steve Klein for the first time. Gilbert explained that, [...] "I've always {{been a part of the}} music and I've always written the music for the band, but I've never been a part of the lyrics. This time <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of felt like in order to kind of have the best record, we had to do things different. That's what made it stand out like that." [...] Regarding the album title, Gilbert detailed that the songs [...] "are all sort of tied together by this theme of wanting to go home", while drummer Cyrus Bolooki said that the title track was one of the first songs written for the album and after assessing the lyrics [...] "it was a phrase that sat well with we wanted the record to communicate." ...|$|E
2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw me coming. I had a big old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E

Cornell said about that period; [...] "I went through a serious crisis with depression where I didn't eat a whole meal every day. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> of shutting down.

I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

The hint worked all right. They're a pretty good bunch, these fellows. They talked it all over and then they came around and asked me if I supposed Sparrer would like to join the Blue Tortoise Patrol. I told them that I was sure he wouldn't if he suspected that the invitation was charity on their part.
