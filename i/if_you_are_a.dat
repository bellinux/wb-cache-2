25|$|Hand loading or {{reloading}} {{is allowed}} in South Africa {{as long as}} you are in possession of a competency certificate to possess a firearm as well as a license to possess such a firearm. Sport shooters load to make the shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may have in your possession is also limited to 200 rounds per chambering. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder's quantity is unlimited <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.|$|E
500|$|Olds had {{a highly}} publicized career and life, {{including}} marriage to Hollywood actress Ella Raines. As a young man he was also recognized for his athletic prowess in both high school and college, being named an All-American as a lineman in college football. Olds expressed his philosophy regarding fighter pilots in the quote: [...] "There are pilots and there are pilots; with the good ones, it is inborn.

[...] P. C. Balasubramanianram and N. Ramakrishnan, in their book, Grand Brand Rajini, said, [...] "Padayappa, in one way, stands testimony to Rajini's life itself." [...] However, S. Shiva Kumar of The Times of India was critical of the film's allusions to the actor's political career, stating that the film was [...] "more style than substance".|$|E
500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making you feel as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> part of the heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E
500|$|A {{study of}} married couples in China noted that men tended to marry down the {{socio-economic}} ladder.

[...] "The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> leftover woman, you are A-quality." [...] A University of North Carolina demographer who studies China's gender imbalance, Yong Cai, further notes that [...] "men {{at the bottom}} of society get left out of the marriage market, and that same pattern is coming to emerge for women at the top of society".|$|E

500|$|Blake {{comments}} that Disraeli [...] "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further {{he wrote a}} discourse on political theory and a political biography, the Life of Lord George Bentinck, which is excellent... remarkably fair and accurate." [...] But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that {{there have always been}} two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, [...] "It is after all, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, {{no matter how much you}} deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Arsenal's defeat, Wenger {{felt that}} [...] " [...] {{is not too}} important. We have won four Community Shields and no-one regards it as a trophy so I do not mind anymore." [...] He felt Chelsea's game plan was [...] "very direct" [...] and {{admitted}} Drogba gave his team [...] "a hard time on the long balls". Wenger absolved Senderos of any blame for the two goals – [...] "it would be unfair" [...] – and believed Fàbregas showed why he was a capable replacement for Patrick Vieira, who left in the summer: [...] "He controlled the game and for me was outstanding." [...] When {{asked if he was}} worried about Chelsea, Wenger retorted: [...] "Did you see the game today? You can be worried <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> Chelsea supporter," [...] an indirect reference to their style of football.|$|E
500|$|Ed Easton Jr. of WNOW-FM {{gave the}} video {{a rating of}} seven out of ten, writing that, [...] "there is plenty of choreographed dancing as Breezy shows us he still got it, getting {{everyone}} in the neighborhood to dance with him. The video {{is good for the}} most part, especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> fan of dancing." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, [...] "it's genuinely a fun clip, absent of any overdone, sexed up R corniness." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the video to Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] (1987), and Janet Jackson's [...] "Alright" [...] (1990), concluding that [...] "sure, the 'Yeah 3x' clip is derivative. But at least Brown is making a serious effort to polish up his commercial appeal once again with both a feel-good, sing-along song and an equally sunny video." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine simply called it a [...] "kid-friendly clip". The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.|$|E

500|$|His work {{steadily}} {{increased in}} amount and quality throughout the 1920s and '30s. By the 1930s {{he was making}} most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk {{that he should not}} be seen in the County Courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers. In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate you want your client to win. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> judge you don't care who wins exactly. All you are concerned about is justice'.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{retired as}} CAS on 30May 1985, having flown {{in excess of}} 8,600 hours during his RAAF career. [...] He was praised by his successor, Air Marshal Jake Newham, for his [...] "extraordinary zeal and robustness" [...] that helped instil [...] "a renewed sense of pride in the Service". In {{retirement}} Evans became a consultant on defence and aviation matters, and wrote and lectured extensively on air power. As a visiting fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in 1986, he produced a working paper focussing on the RAAF's concept of operations, Air Operations in Northern Australia. The same year, he was publicly critical of the Federal government's Dibb Report, claiming that while it contained [...] "sensible policy for the defence of Australia", it did not recognise the ADF's offensive capabilities: [...] "People win wars by taking the initiative. In war the aim must be to win.... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> small force you cannot afford to wait, and otherwise you will be defeated." [...] Evans also stood for political office, running as the Liberal candidate for the seat of Eden-Monaro, New South Wales, in the 1987 Australian federal election. He was competing for the conservative vote with National candidate Peter Cochran, whose party advertising was considered to have outperformed the Liberals'. [...] The seat was retained by incumbent Labor member Jim Snow.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{called it}} [...] "the most mature and {{substantive}} picture to have yet {{emerged from the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth—the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees." [...] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything—and all—it wants to be." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, [...] "a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling {{more than a dozen}} comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean me) lost in the geek weeds." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "If you live and breathe Marvel, {{this is one of the}} MCU's stronger offerings. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Captain America: Civil War does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try." ...|$|E

500|$|More modern {{reception}} for Vampyr {{has been more}} positive. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing." [...] Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, stating that [...] "Vampyr isn't the easiest classic film to enjoy, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> fan of 1930s horror movies...If you're patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of Vampyr, you'll find that this film offers many striking images" [...] and that although the film is [...] "not exciting in terms of pacing, it's a good choice {{if you want to see}} a film that establishes a compelling mood". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The greatness of Carl Dreyer's [...] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has something to do with Dreyer's radical recasting of narrative form". J. Hoberman of the Village Voice wrote that [...] "Vampyr is Dreyer's most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director". Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, comparing it to the silent vampire film Nosferatu, stating that it is [...] "lesser known (but in many ways superior)" [...] and that the film is [...] "a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer's eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare".|$|E

[...] "Once promising, it has outlived its usefulness in the browser, and has become a nightmare that delights cyber-criminals at the expense of computer users." [...] "I think everyone should uninstall Java from all their PCs and Macs, and then think carefully about whether they need to add it back. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> typical home user, you can probably do without it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> business user, you may not have a choice." ...|$|E
