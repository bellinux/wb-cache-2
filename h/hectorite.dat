40|$|Clay minerals, {{and within}} these, the {{smectite}} group, including the <b>hectorites</b> in focus, possess layered structures, in which interlayer chemistry may {{be applied to}} functionalize them optically. While luminescence from organic dyes has previously been described in the structurally closely related montmorillonites, attempts to obtain luminescence from occluded rare earths is not known to exhibit significant efficiency. This may in part {{be due to the}} presence of significant amounts of iron, but is mostly due to the inherent presence of water and structural OH groups. In the present paper, attempts to screen Tb 3 + from disadvantageous matrix interactions by generating complexes with 2, 2 '-bypyridine within the interlayers are described, which eventually yield a 12 -fold increase in emission intensity on complexation or about 20 % in quantum efficiency, respectively. Even very low levels of iron impurities appear to still be a delimiting factor with regard to optical efficiency.

Organoclays based on both low-aspect-ratio <b>hectorites</b> and high-aspect-ratio fluoromicas were evaluated after being dual-modified with two quaternary alkyl ammonium salts with differing degrees of polarity. The resultant nanocomposites were tested for in vitro biostability using physiologically relevant oxidizing conditions. Subsequently, the effects of oxidative treatment on the surface degradation and bulk mechanical integrity of the nanocomposites were investigated and compared with the parent TPUs to identify nanocomposites with the most desirable features for long-term implantation. Here, we demonstrate that the low-aspect-ratio organohectorite was delaminated and well dispersed in the nanocomposites. Importantly, these factors {{gave rise to the}} enhanced oxidative stability. In addition, the mechanical properties of all nanocomposites were less adversely affected by the oxidative treatment compared to their parent TPUs. These results suggest the potential for improved mechanical integrity and biostability when suitable dual modified organoclays are incorporated in a silicone-based TPU. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to synthesize organo-hectorite clays directly from a Mg-silicate gel containing organic or organometallic molecules {{that are expected to}} be incorporated within the interlayer space. Complete crystallization occurs upon aqueous reflux for 48 h. The progress of clay layer formation was monitored by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), differential thermal gravimetry (DTG), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Evidence of clay XRD peaks occurs after just 4 h of hydrothermal treatment, and Mg(OH) 2 is no longer observable after 14 h. Observable changes in DTG and IR occur at about this time as well. Warren line-shape analysis of the 110 reflection indicates that when growth is complete the clay lamellae are on average * 50 % and 25 % of the size of natural <b>hectorites</b> and montmorillonites, respectively. The N 2 BET surface areas for all materials are also compared. Small angle neutron scattering shows that addition of tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) ions does not alter the structural integrity over that of the purely inorganic form of Li-hectorite, but that use of a cationic polymer does significantly alter the microstructure. The effect of temperature is critical, for at room temperature only the layered Mg hydroxide mineral brucite crystallizes unless very long time scales are used. The crystallizations carried out at room temperature show that clay will form after about 3 months, but that the presence of organics (at least TEA) acts to hinder this process greatly. The role of the organic molecules on silicate clay layer formation is compared with the role of organics in zeolite synthesis. Modification of clays with organic species is normally accomplished by simple adsorption from solution or ion-exchange. An alternative method {{has been developed}} in our laboratories which involves direct hydrothermal crystallization of the clay mineral from a gel that contains an organic or organometallic species, which is subsequently incorporated within the interlayer space (Carrado et al., 1994).

The results of T- 2 toxin adsorption on <b>hectorite</b> showed that the T- 2 adsorption capacity decreased with increasing concentration of adsorbent in the suspension for all the investigated pH values.

The rheological {{properties of the}} organophilic products dispersed in toluene were found to depend chiefly on (1) particle size, (2) the expansion behavior of the stacked clay platelets, in which the amount and location of negative charge of the silicate layer affected the expandability, and (3) the amount of methanol added as a polar activator. By the addition of 2 - 4 % methanol, apparent viscosities of the <b>hectorite</b> clays were drastically increased at low shear ate, although even a 10 % addition did not significantly affect he saponite clays. Under the most suitable gellation conditions, the saponite clays showed lower apparent viscosity than the <b>hectorite</b> clays. Inasmuch as the former had its negative charge near {{the surface of the}} silicate layer and formed strong bonds to the organic ion, the expansion of the platelets was apparently difficult. An optimum layer charge for increasing the viscosity was found; specifically 0. 45 - 0. 50 and 0. 50 - 0. 55 equivalents per half unit cell for saponite and <b>hectorite</b> clays, respectively. Because the saponite clays contained a denser population of organic ions than the <b>hectorite</b> clays, the ion density in the interlayer of both clays was considered to be the same, i. e., about 0. 4 organic ions per unit ab area. ~ ~ 0) ~i~+) ', ~,-) -d b ~ 0. 45 ~ 0. 50,,x ~ b ~d b' ~ 0. 50 ~ 0. 55 eq/ha l f unit eei l"~b Key Words [...] <b>Hectorite,</b> Organophilic, Particle aggregation, Rheology, Saponite, Smectite, Viscosity, X-ray powder diffraction...|$|E

The quasi-equilibrium reached by about 6 weeks was reversible with respect to added magnesium ions but only partially so for added silicic acid. The free energy of formation of <b>hectorite</b> at 25 * C was calculated at [...] 2680 kcal/unit call, using the derived equilibrium constant and the stoichiometry of the reaction as pre-viously established...|$|E

The phase {{equilibrium}} of the LiCl-MgCl 2 -Na 2 SiO 3 -H 2 O (LMNH) quaternary system at 150 ℃ was studied and the phase {{diagram of the}} system was plotted, in order to synthesize <b>hectorite</b> with the nature brine, which was rich in lithium and magnesium. The solid phases were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). It was found that <b>hectorite,</b> lithium silicate, karpinskite and brucite can be formed in this system...|$|E
