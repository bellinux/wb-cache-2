The battery used for this application is a Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) battery. The UPS Battery Charger (UBC) application uses the on-chip Internal Precision Oscillator (5 MHz) of the Z 8 Encore! XP ® MCU as System Clock, 16 -bit timer blocks for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and an internal reference voltage of 2 V applied to the ADC and Comparator <b>Input</b> <b>peripheral</b> of the Z 8 Encore! XP ® MCU. The UBC is intended to show how a UPS battery charger design can be implemented with the Z 8 F 082 A Family.

40|$|Olfaction is {{the single}} most studied means of insect chemoreception. Many insects are {{sensitive}} to olfactory signals that advertise relevant ecological information concerning nutrient resources, competitors, predators, potential mates, and host suitability (Price et al., 2011). The olfactory system of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, serves as a genetically and anatomically simple model for studying how sensory input is translated into behavioral output, because only two synapses isolate the <b>input</b> <b>peripheral</b> detection of ecologically relevant olfactory signals from the output behavioral navigation. This genetic and anatomical simplicity of the Drosophila olfactory system allowed us to further our understanding of the Drosophila olfactory neuroecology. Here, we have shown that the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has two olfactory pathways, one that underlies the hardwired innate avoidance of harmful microbes and a second pathway for oviposition in Citrus substrates. We also showed that the peripheral odor detection machinery of D. erecta and D. mojavensis have been modified to match the olfactory needs of their respective ecological systems and associated host plants. Thus the findings of this thesis, while most directly pertinent to the advancement of our understanding of the basic science behind olfactory mechanisms, may also be useful in integrated pest management strategies for these and other potential pest insect...|$|E

40|$|This target article {{examines}} the clinical and experimental evidence for a role of peripheral and central hyperexcitability in persistent pain in four key areas: cutaneous hyperalgesia, referred pain, neuropathic pain, and postoperative pain. Each suggests that persistent pain depends not only on central sensitization, but also on <b>inputs</b> from damaged <b>peripheral</b> tissue. It is instructive to think of central sensitization as comprised of both an initial central sensitization and an ongoing central sensitization driven by <b>inputs</b> from <b>peripheral</b> sources. Each of these factors, initial sensitization, ongoing central sensitization, and <b>inputs</b> from <b>peripheral</b> sources, contributes to the net activity in dorsal horn neurons and thus influences the expression of persistent pain or hyperalgesia. Since each factor, <b>peripheral</b> <b>inputs</b> and central sensitization (initial or ongoing), can contribute to both the initiation and maintenance of persistent pain, therapies should target both peripheral and central sources of pathology...|$|R

5000|$|In computing, {{spooling}} is {{a specialized}} form of multi-programming {{for the purpose}} of copying data between different devices. In contemporary systems it is usually used for mediating between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a printer. Spooling allows programs to [...] "hand off" [...] work to be done by the peripheral and then proceed to other tasks, or do not begin until input has been transcribed. A dedicated program, the spooler, maintains an orderly sequence of jobs for the peripheral and feeds it data at its own rate. Conversely, for slow <b>input</b> <b>peripherals,</b> such as a card reader, a spooler can maintain a sequence of computational jobs waiting for data, starting each job when all of the relevant input is available; see batch processing. The spool itself refers to the sequence of jobs, or the storage area where they are held. In many cases the spooler is able to drive devices at their full rated speed with minimal impact on other processing.|$|R

40|$|Sensory inputs are {{relayed to}} the neocortex by “first-order ” thalamic nuclei, the {{responses}} of which are determined by ascending <b>inputs</b> from <b>peripheral</b> receptors. In contrast, “higher-order ” thalamic nuclei respond poorly to <b>peripheral</b> <b>inputs,</b> and their responses {{are thought to be}} determined by descending cortical inputs. We tested this hypothesis by recording from neurons in the higher-order somatosensory posterior medial (POm) nucleus of narcotized rats. As reported previously, POm neurons responded to whisker stimuli with long-latency (median, 27 msec) and low-magnitude responses, consistent with cortically driven responses. However, when we suppressed inhibitory inputs from the subthalamic nucleus zona incerta (ZI), POm responses were of significantly higher magnitude and shorter latency, with many POm neurons responding at latencies consistent with ascending driving inputs from trigeminal nuclei. Our data suggest that POm comprises two neuronal populations: one population is driven by both <b>peripheral</b> and cortical <b>inputs,</b> and the second population responds only to cortical inputs. These findings demonstrate that ZI gates <b>peripheral</b> <b>inputs</b> to POm, enabling it to function both as a first-order and higher-order nucleus. Because ZI innervates all higher-order nuclei, this gating mechanism may exert similar regulation of thalamic processing in other sensory systems.

40|$|Many {{terminals}} {{are used}} in safety-critical operations in which humans, through terminal user interfaces, {{become a part of}} the system control loop (e. g., medical and industrial systems). These terminals are typically embedded, single-purpose devices with restricted functionality, sometimes air-gapped and increasingly hardened. We describe a new way of attacking such terminals in which an adversary has only temporary, non-invasive, physical access to the terminal. In this attack, the adversary attaches a small device to the interface that connects user <b>input</b> <b>peripherals</b> to the terminal. The device executes the attack when the authorized user is performing safety-critical operations, by modifying or blocking user input, or injecting new input events. Given that the attacker has access to user input, the execution of this attack might seem trivial. However, to succeed, the attacker needs to overcome a number of challenges including the inability to directly observe the user interface and avoid being detected by the users. We present techniques that allow user interface state and input tracking. We evaluate these techniques and show that they can be implemented efficiently. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our attack through an online user study and find input modification attacks that are hard for the users to detect and would therefore lead to serious violations of the input integrity...|$|R

40|$|The <b>input</b> <b>peripherals</b> aren’t anymore {{the only}} way to {{transmit}} intentions to the machine, being now possible to do it with our own body. The number of devices that allow gestural interaction, without the need of intermediate peripherals, are increasing, mainly in the area of video games. This tendency raises several questions that need to be investigated in the area of person-machine interaction. The simplistic approach of transferring interaction concepts from the classic paradigm WIMP, based on the traditional input devices, mouse and keyboard, quickly leads to unexpectedproblems. The characteristics of an interface conceived to a gestural interaction were there isn’t any kind of contact with an input device won’t suit with the paradigm of the last 40 years. So we’re in conditions to exploit how the gestural interaction can contribute to minimize the classic paradigm issues. In this work the field of gestural interaction, with and without voice, will be analyzed. Through the use of applications, it’s intended to lead various studies of virtual objects manipulation based on computational vision. The objects manipulation is done with two kinds of interactions, gestural and voice, that may emerge integrated our not.

40|$|Brain {{disease and}} injury involve the {{activation}} of resident and peripheral immune cells to clear damaged neurons. The regenerative {{nature of the}} zebrafish olfactory system serves as a useful model for examining the response of immune cells following injury. Microglia are the resident immune cells of {{the central nervous system}} that respond to damage by migrating to the site of injury and phagocytizing neuronal debris. Preliminary data suggested that peripheral deafferentation and direct injury to the bulb result in activation of microglia, but the origin and pattern of microglial migration remains unclear. We performed peripheral deafferentation and direct injury to the olfactory bulb in the whole fish and compared it to the isolated brain removed of all afferent <b>input</b> and <b>peripheral</b> influence. The olfactory bulbs of adult zebrafish were damaged by cauterizing the olfactory organ or directly injuring the bulb with a stab wound. Removal of afferent <b>input</b> and <b>peripheral</b> influence was performed by isolating and culturing the brain. Mouse monoclonal 4 C 4 antibody was used to label microglia. Comparisons of whole fish treatment groups to controls showed a significant increase in activated microglia in the damaged bulb following peripheral deafferentation at 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post injury. Amoeboid profiles significantly increased between 1 - 4 h, decreased between 4 - 12 h, increased again at 12 - 24 h, and decreased again at 24 - 48 h. Following direct injury to the bulb, there was a significant increase in activated microglia in the ipsilateral and contralateral bulbs at 1 and 4 h after injury. Following 4 h after injury, there was a significant decrease in amoeboid profiles, which remained low until 72 h. Comparisons of isolated brain treatment groups to controls showed significantly more activated microglia in the olfactory bulbs after 4 and 12 h in culture. Isolated brains that received a direct injury showed significant increase in activated microglia after 1, 4, and 12 h in culture. Isolated brains that received a direct injury also showed significantly less responsive microglia in the damaged bulb when compared to the direct injury to the bulb in the whole fish at 12 h. Peripheral deafferentation and direct injury to the olfactory bulb result in different microglial response profiles and suggest a temporal significance and selective phagocytosis during the resolution of inflammation. Microglia can respond to signals without afferent <b>input</b> or <b>peripheral</b> influence up to a certain time after injury. Further work is required to explore the origin and temporal sequence of the immune cells that respond to injury...|$|R
25|$|Studies on {{zebra finch}} {{have shown that}} nuclei in the {{auditory}} thalamus, two steps up from the cochlea, do not passively relay <b>input</b> from <b>peripheral</b> sensory structures into higher forebrain structures. Thalamic nuclei show different patterns of gene expression in response to different stimuli, implicating them {{in the process of}} acoustic discrimination. Neurons in the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov) have receptive fields that are tuned to respond to the specific combination of spectral and temporal features present in syllables of conspecific song. Stimulus-selective tuning is determined by the receptor proteins and ion channels characterizing synapses of these neurons. Neurons can selectively respond to time-based differences between songs (e.g. syllable length or syllable-interval length) if they are post-synaptic to either fast-release (ionotropic) or slow-release (metabotropic) glutamate receptors.|$|R

50|$|Peripheral chemoreceptors work {{in concert}} with central chemoreceptors, which also monitor blood CO2 but {{do it in the}} {{cerebrospinal}} fluid surrounding the brain. A high concentration of central chemoreceptors is found in the ventral medulla, the brainstem area that receives <b>input</b> from <b>peripheral</b> chemoreceptors. Taken together, these blood oxygen monitors contribute nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which can modulate several processes, including breathing, airway resistance, blood pressure, and arousal, with central chemoformation about medullary oxygen levels and peripheral chemoreceptors about arterial oxygen. At an evolutionary level, this stabilization of oxygen levels, which also results in a more constant carbon dioxide concentration and pH, was important to manage oxygen flow in air-vs.-water breathing, sleep, and to maintain an ideal pH for protein structure, since fluctuations in pH can denature a cell's enzymes.|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{cortical}} {{reorganization of}} the somatotopic arrangement of the digits after alterations of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>input</b> is well established. Studies on the immediate effects of manipulating <b>peripheral</b> <b>input</b> have shown conflicting results indicating that additional factors might modulate cortical reorganization. We present a source localization study using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) following electric stimulation of digits one and five before and during anaesthesia of digits two, three and four in 10 normal volunteers. When attention was directed to a stimulus at the dorsal hand, the 3 D-distance between digits one and five decreased during as compared to before anaesthesia. In contrast, this distance enlarged when subjects were not attending a particular stimulus. In this condition most subjects focused their attention on the clear sensation of the de-afferented hand region. These results indicate that attention modulates the effect of immediate cortical {{reorganization of the}} hand area during partial deafferentation. As an hypothesis: it may be speculated that the sensation of the de-afferentation results in increased synchronized activity of the de-afferented somatosensory cortex and, thus, to its enlarged representation.
