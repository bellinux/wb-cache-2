5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
40|$|We model {{expressive}} timing for a phrase in performed classical music as being dependent on two factors: <b>the</b> {{expressive timing}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>phrase</b> and <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> within <b>the</b> piece. We present a model selection test for evaluating candidate models that assert different dependencies for deciding the Cluster of Expressive Timing (CET) for a phrase. We use cross entropy and Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence {{to evaluate the}} resulting models: with these criteria we find that both <b>the</b> expressive timing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>phrase</b> and <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music score affect expressive timing <b>in</b> a <b>phrase.</b> <b>The</b> results show that <b>the</b> expressive timing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>phrase</b> has a greater effect on timing choices than the position of <b>the</b> <b>phrase,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> position only impacts the choice of expressive timing <b>in</b> combination with <b>the</b> choice of expressive timing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>phrase...</b>|$|R

25|$|The word entered Late Middle English in {{the fourteenth}} century via Old French orenge (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> pomme d'orenge). The French word, in turn, comes from Old Provençal auranja, based on Arabic nāranj. In several languages, the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because {{it may have been}} mistaken as part of an {{indefinite}} article ending in an n sound—in French, for example, une norenge may have been heard as une orenge. This linguistic change is called juncture loss. The color was named after the fruit, and the first recorded use of orange as a color name in English was in 1512.|$|E
25|$|The term ban {{is still}} used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> banski dvori ("ban's court") for the {{buildings}} that host high government officials. The Banski dvori in Zagreb hosts the Croatian Government, while the Banski dvor in Banja Luka hosts the President of Republika Srpska (a first-tier subdivision of Bosnia and Herzegovina). The building known as Bela banovina ("the white banovina") in Novi Sad hosts the parliament and {{government of the}} Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. The building received this name because it previously hosted the administration of Danube Banovina (1929–1941). Banovina is also the colloquial name of the city hall building in Split, and of the administrative building (rectorate and library) of the University of Niš.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{particularly}} with noun and adjective phrases, {{it is not}} always clear which dependents are to be classed as complements, and which as adjuncts. Although in principle the head-directionality parameter concerns the order of heads and complements only, considerations of head-initiality and head-finality sometimes take account of the position of the head <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> as a whole, including adjuncts. The structure of the various types of phrase is analyzed below in relation to specific languages, with a focus on the ordering of head and complement. In some cases (such as English and Japanese) this ordering is found to be the same in practically all types of phrase, whereas in others (such as German and Gbe) the pattern is less consistent. Different theoretical explanations of these inconsistencies are discussed later in the article.|$|E
25|$|Alternate {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} syntax make different assumptions regarding {{what is considered}} a constituent. In mainstream phrase structure grammar (and its derivatives), individual words are constituents {{in and of themselves}} as well as being parts of other constituents, whereas in dependency grammar, certain core words in each phrase are not a constituent by themselves, but only members of a phrasal constituent. The following trees show the same sentence in two different theoretical representations, with a phrase structure representation on the left and a dependency grammar representation on the right. In both trees, a constituent is understood to be the entire tree or any labelled subtree (a node plus all the nodes dominated by that node); note that words like killed and with, for instance, form subtrees (and are considered constituents) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> structure representation but not in the dependency structure representation.|$|E
25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrase</b> 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched out. There is a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how syntax {{and focus}} {{interact}} <b>in</b> deriving <b>the</b> phonological <b>phrasing</b> of utterances in Xhosa, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa. Although {{the influence of}} syntax on phrasing is uncontroversial, a purely syntactic analysis cannot account for all the data reported for Xhosa by Jokweni (1995). Focus influences <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> <b>in</b> that it inserts a phonological phrase-boundary after the focused constituent. This generalization can account for <b>the</b> variation found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> of adverbials. <b>The</b> findings are dealt with in an OT-based framework following Truckenbrodt’s work on Chichewa (1995, 1999) which is extended to <b>the</b> <b>phrasing</b> of adjuncts. ...|$|R
