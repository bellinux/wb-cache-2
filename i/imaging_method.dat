25|$|A medical <b>imaging</b> <b>method</b> {{employing}} tomography where digital geometry processing is used {{to generate}} a three-dimensional image of the internal structures of an object from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation. CT produces a volume of data, which can be manipulated, through {{a process known as}} windowing, in order to demonstrate various structures based on their ability to attenuate and prevent transmission of the incident X-ray beam.|$|E
25|$|X-rays and {{computerized}} tomography (CT) are not used, {{especially in the}} first trimester, due to the ionizing radiation, which has teratogenic effects on the foetus. No effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated, but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, obstetric ultrasonography is the <b>imaging</b> <b>method</b> of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no radiation, is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.|$|E

500|$|Research {{continues}} {{into the}} best <b>imaging</b> <b>method</b> for detecting and staging endometrial cancer. In surgery, {{research has shown}} that complete pelvic lymphadenectomy along with hysterectomy in stage 1 endometrial cancer does not improve survival and increases the risk of negative side effects, including lymphedema. Other research is exploring the potential of identifying the sentinel lymph nodes for biopsy by injecting the tumor with dye that shines under infrared light. Intensity modulated radiation therapy is currently under investigation, and already used in some centers, for application in endometrial cancer, to reduce side effects from traditional radiotherapy. Its risk of recurrence has not yet been quantified. Research on hyperbaric oxygen therapy to reduce side effects is also ongoing. [...] The results of the PORTEC 3 trial assessing combining adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy were awaited in late 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The {{perceived}} {{pitch of}} a person's voice {{is determined by}} a number of different factors, most importantly the fundamental frequency of the sound generated by the larynx. [...] The fundamental frequency is influenced by the length, size, and tension of the vocal folds. [...] This frequency averages about 125 Hz in an adult male, 210Hz in adult females, and over 300Hz in children. Depth-Kymography is an <b>imaging</b> <b>method</b> to visualize the complex horizontal and vertical movements of vocal folds.|$|E
2500|$|Serial time encoded amplified {{microscopy}} (STEAM) is an <b>imaging</b> <b>method</b> {{that provides}} ultrafast shutter speed and frame rate, by using optical image amplification {{to circumvent the}} fundamental trade-off between sensitivity and speed, and a single-pixel photodetector to {{eliminate the need for}} a detector array and readout time limitations [...] The method is at least 1000 times faster than the state-of-the-art CCD and CMOS cameras. Consequently, it is potentially useful for a broad range of scientific, industrial, and biomedical applications that require high image acquisition rates, including real-time diagnosis and evaluation of shockwaves, microfluidics, MEMS, and laser surgery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Imaging Methods in Anthropology. Anthropology, {{a science}} {{born in the}} 16 th century, deals with humans. One of its {{branches}} is physical anthropology which includes forensic anthropology and osteology. The <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> in anthropology are indispensable tool for identification {{of the dead and}} for examination of mummies or other prehistoric bone material. Comparing of pre-death and after-death x-ray snapshots is essential for identification of human remains in forensic anthropology and odontology. The latest trend is 3 D face reconstruction with the help of computed tomography. The aim of the thesis is: 1. To analyse all the methods available in the field of anthropology of the present time which use the radiology <b>imaging</b> <b>methods.</b> 2. To compare using of the computed tomography in the Czech Republic and other European countries. The data were obtained through questionnaires sent to anthropology institutes and museums dealing with photographing historical bone material and through searching and processing information focused on the topic of the theses. The results show that the <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> in anthropology are under-used. The anthropologists are fully aware of all available <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> but the methods are not used often enough because of financial and time consuming reasons. On the contrary to under-using the <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> in the Czech Republic the other European countries use the methods a lot more often. A hypothesis was established {{at the beginning of the}} research: ?All the available modern radiology <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> are not used enough in the Czech Republic. The hypothesis was confirmed. I would like to present the results of the theses at the specialist?s seminars of radiology assistants and to point out the possible further use of radiology <b>imaging</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the knowledge about diagnostic <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> among primary care and medical emergency physicians. Materials and Methods Study developed with 119 primary care and medical emergency physicians in Montes Claros, MG, Brazil, {{by means of}} a structured questionnaire about general knowledge and indications of <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> in common clinical settings. A rate of correct responses corresponding to &# 8805; 80 % was considered as satisfactory. The Poisson regression (PR) model was utilized in the data analysis. Results Among the 81 individuals who responded the questionnaire, 65 % (n = 53) demonstrated to have satisfactory general knowledge and 44 % (n = 36) gave correct responses regarding indications of <b>imaging</b> <b>methods.</b> Respectively, 65 % (n = 53) and 51 % (n = 41) of the respondents consider that radiography and computed tomography do not use ionizing radiation. The prevalence of a satisfactory general knowledge about <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> was associated with medical residency in the respondents' work field (PR = 4. 55; IC 95 %: 1. 18 - 16. 67; p-value: 0. 03), while the prevalence of correct responses regarding indication of <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> was associated with the professional practice in primary health care (PR = 1. 79; IC 95 %: 1. 16 - 2. 70; p-value: 0. 01).

30|$|The {{clinical}} sign of coma {{is a common}} feature in critical care medicine. However, little information has been put forth on the correlations between coma and cerebral <b>imaging</b> <b>methods.</b> The purpose of the article is to compile the available information derived from various <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> and placing it {{in a context of}} clinical knowledge of coma and related states. The definition of coma and the cerebral structures responsible for consciousness are described; the mechanisms of cerebral lesions leading to impaired consciousness and coma are explained. Cerebral <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> provide a large array of information on the structural changes of brain tissue in the various diseases leading to coma. Circumscript lesions produce space-occupying masses that displace the brain, ultimately leading to various types of herniation. Generalized disease of the brain usually leads to diffuse brain swelling which also can cause herniation. Epileptic states, however, rarely are detectable by <b>imaging</b> <b>methods</b> and mandate EEG examinations. Another important aspect of imaging in coma is the increasing use of functional <b>imaging</b> <b>methods,</b> which can detect the function of loss of function in various areas of the brain and render information on the extent and severity of brain damage {{as well as on the}} prognosis of disease. The MRI methods of 1 H-spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging may provide more functional information in the future.|$|R
