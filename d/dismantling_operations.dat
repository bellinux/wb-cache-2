40|$|The {{dismantling}} of nuclear facilities {{is in progress}} since 20 years in Germany. Practical experiences in decommissioning have shown, that problem can occur during <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations</b> caused by release of residual stresses. In this case cutting parts or cutting tools get jammed if mechanical cutting techniques are used. The aim of this research work was to develop measuring techniques for {{the determination of the}} stress state in RPV, to predict the deformation during <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations.</b> This can serve as additional base for improved decommissioning planning and for time optimised dismantling. For determination of the stress state in components two small and inexpensive measuring techniques were new designed, for remote-controlled on-site use in atmosphere and under water. For the nondestructive determination of the directional stress state, based on the magnetostriction and the Harmonic-Analysis of alternating magnetic fields, a new developed rotating sensor is in use with a principal magnetisation direction. Because of the mainly isotropic material properties and the directional stresses, measured Harmonic values are influenced mainly by the stress state in the surface areas. In this way it is possible to determine the stress state qualitatively and the direction of principal stresses in the surface areas of the component. As an alternative to the established wire strain gauge, which remote-controlled application is still not possible under water, a new slot jet cutting strain control technique was designed. This technique detects the deformation in the surface after stresses are cut free by a water jet. So the stress state could be determined quantitatively in the surface and assessed in the depth. With the help of these two measuring techniques it is possible to characterize the stress state along a planned cutting line. The use of an adapted FEM simulation enables to calculate and determine the deformation of the cutting gap beforehand. These information can be used to work out a dismantling strategy that guarantees an undisturbed dismantling. (orig.)

40|$|New Zealand has {{a problem}} with an {{increasing}} number of motor vehicles being abandoned {{at the end of their}} useful life. The environmental and associated social costs created by this problem are expected to increase with the rising number of vehicles entering the country. In addition, there are environmental concerns regarding some aspects of the legal disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). The exact magnitude of both problems is unknown and attempts made to address them have been ad hoc and success limited. This thesis sets out to quantify the problems and provide policy makers with tools to improve the overall management of motor vehicle disposal in New Zealand. To assess the extent and cost of the abandoned vehicle problem, local authorities are surveyed. The legislation dealing with car ownership, transferral and disposal and its implementation are scrutinised for weaknesses that allow ELVs to be abandoned without penalty. The automobile recycling industry is surveyed to determine the environmental impact from the industry's activities. Using semi-structured surveys, policies and practices used in other countries for the management of ELVs are investigated and assessed for effectiveness. Their application to the New Zealand situation is ascertained. Of the vehicles which are deregistered each year, one in five is dumped. The direct cost to local authorities, to deal with the 25, 500 vehicles abandoned each year, is more than six million dollars. In addition, practices and standards for the removal and disposal of hazardous substances from ELVs vary nationwide, adding to the environmental burden caused by vehicle disposal. Recommendations for the improved management of ELVs target four areas, legislation, institutional practices, entry into the recycling system and <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations.</b> Minor changes to legislation and institutional practices combined with rigorous enforcement will close the data gaps and overcome free-rider problems. A disposal charge added to the registration fee of vehicles entering the country will allow ELV owners to dispose of their vehicles free-of-charge. Improved environmental performance by automotive dismantlers can be achieved through licensing and consistent monitoring from within the industry. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to better management of ELVs, through changed behaviour by private individuals and <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations,</b> and a reduction in the environmental costs associated with vehicle disposal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{accordance}} with the increased awareness of resource depletion and environmental pollution, the importance of eco-friendly disposal and recycling of vehicles as a potentially valuable resource is emphasized; in particular, {{this is important as}} automobile production and demand continues steadily. In this paper, a systematic dismantling system is proposed to minimize the quantity of ASR by dismantling End-of-Life Vehicles(ELVs) rationally and efficiently. An adaptive layout design system is also provided to aid for the effective implementation of the proposed dismantling system to industrial applications. The proposed dismantling system is based on eco-friendly dismantling and improves not only the recyclability of ELVs, but also the efficiency of the <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations.</b> The adaptive layout design system is a software tool, which allows a layout of a dismantling plant according to the specific requirements of the customers, and estimates the overall figures and capacity of an intended plant by simulation of the dismantling process. This interactive design system can be useful for testing alternative layouts of a dismantling plant customized to meet particular recycling needs...|$|E

A set of ~ 40 irradiating scenarios is considered, i. e. neutron and proton particles of different energies, ranging from zero to many hundreds MeV, impinging on pure elements or materials of standard composition typically used in industrial applications (namely, AISI SS 316 and Portland concrete).

40|$|Remote-handled {{maintenance}} and <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations</b> in {{nuclear power plants}} may benefit {{from the use of}} radiation-hardened multi-component force sensors. Multi-component force sensing is usually done with local strain measurements on an elastic transducer.

In this paper, we discuss the preliminary calibration of the multi-component force sensor and we present the irradiation results of FBG sensors. We first designed a multi-component force sensor based on eight multiplexed FBG strain sensors. The radiation hardness of the force sensor mainly depends on the radiation hardness of the FBG strain sensor itself. Therefore, we also investigated the #-radiation response of unstrained FBG strain sensors, written in germanosilicate fibres. We irradiated such sensors up to MGy dose levels. At a total dose of 0. 1 MGy, the radiation-induced Bragg peak shift saturated. This indicates that FBG strain sensors can be applied in nuclear environments...|$|E

The produced ASR materials underwent an extended characterization and some post-shredding processes, consisting of dimensional, magnetic, electrostatic and densimetric separation phases, were tested on laboratory scale, having as main purpose the enhancement of ASR recovery/recycling and the minimization of the landfilled fraction. The gathered results show that accurate depollution and <b>dismantling</b> <b>operations</b> are mandatory to obtain a high quality ASR material which may be recycled/recovered and partially landfilled according to the actual European Union regulations, with particular concern for Lower Heating Value (LHV), heavy metals content and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) as critical parameters.
