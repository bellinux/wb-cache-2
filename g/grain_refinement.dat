40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{semi-solid}} processing is paid {{to attention}} {{in the field of}} the light alloys. By this method, it is improved ductility and fatigue strength. Although, because of those mechanical properties of the elongation and toughness is not excellent, the range that can be the application to parts is limited. On the other hand, it is reported that <b>grain</b> <b>refinements</b> cause improvement of ductility and appearance of super plasticity. Then, Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) method is reported to be effective to the sample making of a bulk and ultra fine grain in various alloys in recent years. In this study, it tried to improve ductility and durability due to making ultra fine grain in AC 4 CH alloys by the ECAP method, and the influence of ECAP processing on the mechanical property of AC 4 CH was investigated. As the result, the ductility of AC 4 CH has improved by ECAP processing. However, the tensile strength of AC 4 CH declined along with {{the increase in the number}} of passes. So, for the purpose of additional improvement of tensile strength, ECAP-Back Pressure (ECAP-BP) method that was reported to be more effective for <b>grain</b> <b>refinements</b> than ECAP method was applied to semi-solid AC 4 CH and compared with ECAP method. As the result, the tensile strength of AC 4 CH was maintained by use of ECAP-BP. Moreover, both ductility and toughness of that have been also improved...|$|R

50|$|Generally, polycrystals {{cannot be}} superheated; they will melt {{promptly}} {{once they are}} brought to a high enough temperature. This is because grain boundaries are amorphous, and serve as nucleation points for the liquid phase. By contrast, if no solid nucleus is present as a liquid cools, it tends to become supercooled.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the microstructure and mechanical properties of cross roll rolled Ni- 30 Cr alloy, comparing with conventionally rolled material, this work was carried out. The materials were cold rolled to 90 % in thickness reduction by conventional rolling and cross roll rolling methods and subsequently annealed at 700 ℃ for 30 min.

The application of cross roll rolling was more effective to develop the microstructure and mechanical properties than those of conventional rolling. As a result, the grain size was significantly refined to 1. 3 µm in conventional rolling and 0. 6 µm in cross roll rolling, compared to initial material (30 µm), respectively.

At stress amplitudes close to the fatigue limit endurance limit of 107 cycles, subcritical crack nuclei initiated at graphite nodules. The crack nucleus decelerated and arrested after propagating a short distance. The position of an arrested crack tip was characterized using an electron backscatter diffraction technique, demonstrating that short fatigue cracks in austempered ductile cast iron (ADI) can be arrested by boundaries such as those between ausferrite sheaves or packets and prior austenite <b>grains.</b> <b>Refinement</b> of the prior austenite grain size decreased the size of subcritical crack nuclei.

50|$|In {{friction}} stir processing (FSP), {{a rotating}} tool is {{used with a}} pin and a shoulder to {{a single piece of}} material to make specific property enhancement, such as improving the material’s toughness or flexibility, in a specific area in the micro-structure of the material via fine grain of a second material with properties that improve the first.(MA) Friction between the tool and workpieces results in localized heating that softens and plasticizes the workpiece. A volume of processed material is produced by movement of materials {{from the front of the}} pin to the back of the pin. During this process, the material undergoes intense plastic deformation and this results in significant <b>grain</b> <b>refinement.</b> (Misha) FSP changes physical properties without changing physical state which helps engineers create things such as “high-strain-rate superplasticity”. The <b>grain</b> <b>refinement</b> occurs on the base material improving properties of the first material, while mixing with the second material. This causes for the base material’s properties. This allows for a variety of materials to be altered to be changed for things that may require other difficult to acquire conditions. The processes branches off of friction stir welding (FSW) which uses the same process to weld two pieces of different materials together without heating, melting, or having to change the materials’ physical state.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The work {{presents}} the results on <b>grains</b> <b>refinement</b> of steel containing 0, 45 wt pct carbon resulted from severe plastic deformation (SPD). Different steel structures from prior solutioning and/or thermomechanical treatment were prepared for deformation experimental. A coarse grain ferrite-pearlite structure was achieved applying solutioning. By application of thermomechanical (TM) controlled forging process, performing multistep open die forging, the refined ferrite-pearlite mixture was prepared. Final structure refinement of steel, having different initial structure, was then accomplished applying warm Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 400 °C. Employment of this processing route resulted in extensive deformation of ferrite grains and cementite lamellae fragmentation. Applying the highest shear stress (εef- 4) the mixed structure of subgrains and ultrafine grains was present within the ferrite phase. In pearlite grains, modification of cementite lamellae due to shearing, bending, twisting and breaking was found efficient. The coarse cementite lamellae spheroidization was more efficient in prior TM treated steel. The tensile deformation records confirmed strength increase and diversity in strain hardening behaviour.

While binary alloys are more easily understood as an academic exercise, commercial alloys often use three components for precipitation strengthening, in compositions such as Al(Mg, Cu) and Ti(Al, V). A large number of other constituents may be unintentional, but benign, or may be added for other purposes such as <b>grain</b> <b>refinement</b> or corrosion resistance.

50|$|The {{addition}} of scandium to aluminium creates nanoscale Al3Sc precipitates which limit the excessive grain growth {{that occurs in}} the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other aluminium alloys and the width of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of age-hardenable aluminium alloys is reduced.

40|$|The {{considerations}} of ADI strengthening mechanisms {{based on results}} of previous structure investigations are presented. The aim of this elaboration was to discuss which mechanism looks to be most responsible for strengthening of ADI. It was concluded that the high strength of ADI which matrix consist mostly ferrite, austenite and sometimes some amount of martensite is caused by strengthening these three phases. Neglecting high carbon martensite which strength properties are nothing surprising, it is proposed that different mechanism of strengthening are responsible for ferrite and austenite strength increase. In case first of these phases strengthening is caused mainly by strain hardening. It is evidenced with very high dislocations and dislocation loops density which are typical in case of ferrite grains. The mechanism of austenite strengthening is more complicated. First of all hardening of austenite is connected with high supersaturation with carbon. The effect of strengthening is additionally increased with <b>grains</b> <b>refinement</b> caused by twinning and formation of stacking faults. The first of them supply extra coherent grain boundaries and the second lead to distortion of perfect lattice structure. It looks from the analysis, that strengthening rather soft and ductile phases which are ferrite and austenite is high enough to explain high strength properties of ADI...|$|R
50|$|Cryomilling is a {{variation}} of mechanical milling, in which metallic powders or other samples (e.g. temperature sensitive samples and samples with volatile components) are milled in a cryogen (usually liquid nitrogen or liquid argon) slurry or at a cryogenics temperature under processing parameters, so a nanostructured microstructure is attained.

50|$|One {{method for}} {{controlling}} grain size in aluminum alloys is by introducing particles {{to serve as}} nucleants, such as Al-5%Ti.
