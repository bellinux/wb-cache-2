40|$|By {{means of}} {{augmented}} reality (AR) systems {{it has become}} increasingly easy to manipulate our perception of real objects. In this position paper we review existing work that changes physical property perception, and propose methods for changing perceived object density during haptic interaction. Our goal is to modulate the sound emitted by an object when touched. We hypothesize that augmented sound can make people think that an object is <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> regardless of its actual object density. We describe an experiment to validate this hypothesis. Participants tap a <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> cube and are asked to determine if it is <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid,</b> based on the multimodal feedback. This research is a first step towards an AR system that can alter multimodal perception of object physical properties, and open doors for related research...|$|R

50|$|Ancient Athens had a mechanism, called dikastaí, {{to assure}} {{that no one could}} select jurors for their own trial. For normal cases, the courts were made up of dikastai of up to 500 citizens. For capital cases—those that {{involved}} death, loss of liberty, exile, loss of civil rights, or seizure of property—the trial was before a jury of 1,001 to 1,501 dikastai. In such large juries, the unanimity rule would be unrealistic, and verdicts were reached by majority. Juries were appointed by lot. Jurists cast a ceramic disk with an axle in its middle: the axle was either <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid.</b> Thus the way they voted was kept secret because the jurists would hold their disk by the axle by thumb and forefinger, thus hiding whether its axle was <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid.</b> Since Periclean times, jurists were compensated for their sitting in court, with the amount of one day's wages.|$|R

To this end, in this paper the problem of a body containing a <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> spherical inclusion subjected to a spherically symmetric loading is investigated in the framework of the elasticity theory. The interphase zone around the inclusion is modeled by considering the elastic properties varying with the radius moving away from the interface with inclusion and, asymptotically approaching the value of the homogeneous matrix. The explicit solutions are obtained in closed form by using hypergeometric functions and numerical investigations are performed to highlight the localized effects of the graded interphase in the stress transfer between inclusion and matrix. Finally, the exact solutions are used to estimate the effective bulk modulus of a material containing a dispersion of <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> spherical inclusions with graded interphase zone...|$|R

This is promoted by their multifunctionality, biocompatibility, flexible and tunable molecular structure by chemical modification, rigid and planar molecular skeleton, which make porphyrin-involved nanomaterials have rich assembly, physicochemical and biochemical properties [26, 27, 29, 32 – 39]. For example, we have recently demonstrated that a metal porphyrin, zinc 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetra(4 -pyridyl)- 21 H, 23 H-porphine [ZnTPyP], could be organized to form various well-defined nanostructures in a controllable manner via a SASA method through an oil/water system [39].

For the lubrication of the aluminium cold extrusion process, to prevent adhesion and to reduce tool wear, the application of zinc stearate is still widely used. Because zinc stearate is a powder it has to be applied on the slugs by a tumbling process which leads to a strong dust formation. Furthermore it may cause respiratory irritation; the thermal decomposition forms toxic and irritating vapours.

Exact solutions of differential equations are obtained for each homogenous layer of the multilayered cylinder. The results are verified with those available in litera-ture for a homogenous infinitely long cylinder and can also be applied to study the multi-physics of thin circular disks.

Dr. Landau has done work examining the geometric properties involved in people’s representations of object nouns as opposed to spatial prepositions and has found differences in how the two are encoded. For object nouns, people’s mental representations include detailed geometric features. These include things like the parts of the object, whether it is <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> and the orientation of the axes (e.g. the back, front and sides of the object). For prepositions, people’s spatial representations are much less detailed. The only shape information is about the axes and is basically a general “sketch” of the word. The spatial relationships communicated by prepositions also lack detail and consist of simple states (e.g. the objects are in contact, one object contains another) and relative distances.|$|R

For all these spherically <b>or</b> cylindrically symmetric <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> nanostructures, independent of material composition and whether the boundary conditions are hard or soft, the dominant orbital current originates from intermixing of valence band states in the electron ground state, circulates within the nanostructure, and peaks approximately halfway between the center and edge of the nanostructure in the plane perpendicular to the spin orientation. For a specific material composition and confinement character, the confinement energy and orbital moment are determined by a single size-dependent parameter for spherically symmetrical nanostructures, whereas they can be independently tuned for cylindrically symmetric nanostructures.

Scaled tank experiments were conducted with 4 different cylinders (fluid-filled and solid aluminium, air-filled and solid stainless steel, respectively) and 2 seabed types (silt and gravel), using the facilities at the University of Bath. The setup was a 10 : 1 scaled version of the EC-SITAR sea trials site in the Stockholm Archipelago (Sweden). The main aim of these experiments was to design efficient surveying strategies, later used at sea. Our studies showed large variations depending on the aspect of these targets and their bistatic imaging configuration. These variations can be {{directly related to the}} shapes of the targets (e. g. dimensions, presence of ribs), their content (<b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid)</b> and the material of the shells (e. g. stainless steel or aluminium).

Consequently, recycling waste paper for use as a construction material constitutes a step towards sustainable development. This research effort aims at determining the density, water absorption capacity, compressive strength and fire resistance of papercrete produced using waste newspaper and office paper in order to ascertain their suitability for use as a building construction material. For each of the mix proportions considered, the bulk density, water absorption, compressive strength and fire resistance of papercrete made with newspaper were found to be higher than those made with office paper. The water absorption and fire resistance of papercrete were found to be high and increased with increasing waste paper content while the bulk density and compressive strength of papercrete were low and decreased with increasing waste paper content. Papercrete was recommended to be an effective and sustainable material for the production of lightweight and fire-resistant <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> blocks to be used to make partition walls of especially high-rise buildings.

30|$|The theoretical- and experimental-based {{understanding}} of the growth mechanisms of CNT {{would not have been}} possible without the use of TEM, officially invented by Siemens in 1939. TEM has enabled the confirmation of the crystallographic and morphologic structures of a variety of carbon-based materials. It is important to point out that in 1958, Radushkevich and Lukyanovich [30] highlighted the wealth of structural information that was possible from HRTEM, making this technique very interesting in the characterization of nanotubular-sized carbon growth, as it can be done in situ, allowing for direct observation in the characterized sample. In our experimental analysis, we hypothesize that the carbon microspheres and the nanotubes tested were of solid carbon structures. It was difficult to identify whether the cores of the carbon microsphere and CNT were <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid.</b> Based on a previous discussion on FESEM analysis, there are inherent limitations in FESEM analysis; this is only suitable for the analysis of the outer surface of the material, as its magnification is too low for the crystal structure to be observed in atomic level. Moreover, the analyzed sample could be either in a crystalline or amorphous phase. However, further investigation is needed to confirm the crystallographic structure of carbon microspheres and nanotubular structures.|$|R
50|$|A rostellum is a knob-like {{protrusion}} at {{the extreme}} anterior end of a tapeworm, {{as an extension of}} the tegument. It is globular, spiny structure when it protrudes, and a circular hollow pit when retracted. It is structurally composed of a number of concentric rows of hooks. The number and arrangement of the hooks are species specific. The two basic types of hooks are those of the upper row, which are larger and had a projecting, rounded stout guard, and those of the lower row, which are smaller and have a flattened guard. At the base, the hooks gradually resemble the general body hairs or microtriches. This shows that the hooks are modified microtriches. Electron-dense hook substance is deposited along the edges of the microthrix to form the hook blade and basal plate. The blade may be <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> depending on the species. The base is connected to the underlying cytoplasm. Rostellum is innervated by a single bilateral pair of ganglia, which provide motor innervation of the anterior canal, and the circular muscles of the rostellar capsule; this connection controls the protrusion and retraction movements. The tegument lining the anterior canal and covering the apical rostellum is syncytial and continuous with the tegument of the scolex proper.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{impedance}} {{at the center of}} a patch antenna element is a short circuit, implying that a wire or post can be connected from the patch to the groundplane at this point without impacting radiation performance. In principle, this central post can be used to support the patch element, thus eliminating the need for dielectric. In spaceborne applications, this approach is problematic because a patch element supported by a single, thin post is highly susceptible to acoustic loads during launch. The technology reported here uses a large-diameter center post as its supporting structure. The supporting structure allows for the fabrication of a sufficiently rigid antenna element that can survive launch loads. The post may be either <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid,</b> depending on fabrication approach and/or mass constraints. The patch antenna element and support post are envisioned as being fabricated (milled) from a single piece of aluminum or other metal. Alternately, the patch plate and support column can be fabricated separately and then joined using fasteners, adhesive, or welding. Casting and electroforming are also viable techniques for manufacturing the metal patch part(s). The patch structure is then either bonded or fastened to the supporting groundplane. Arrays of patch elements can be fabricated by attaching several structures to a common groundplane/support structure...|$|R

It is shown that the two problems are governed by formally similar sets of ordinary differential equations in the kinematic fields (in-plane displacements and microrotations). In the general case, numerical solutions are derived. The solution for the cylinder subjected to radial pressure does not significantly differ from that obtained in classical elasticity, {{at least in terms of}} radial and hoop force stresses. In the case of a cylinder subjected to torsion the difference between the micropolar and the classical solutions is more pronounced. The torque induces twisting couple stresses about the cylinder axis of variable sign. Finally, size effects in terms of torsional inertia are pointed out...|$|R

Optical diffraction measurements of close-packed arrays revealed maximal dimensions of 122 +/- 4 A and 129 +/- 9 A for 3 -subunit ECF 1 and 4 -subunit CF 1, respectively. Molecules which displayed either <b>hollow</b> <b>or</b> <b>solid</b> hexagonal morphologies were observed in all preparations.

Differences between hollow and solid morphologies cannot be attributed solely to {{the presence or absence}} of the delta and epsilon subunits; therefore, the two image types may represent staining variants of a common structure.
