5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 908, Flann, {{aided by}} his {{son-in-law}} Cerball mac Muirecáin, and Cathal mac Conchobair, King of Connacht, {{fought against the}} Munstermen, again led by Cormac and Flaithbertach, at the Battle of Bellaghmoon (near Castledermot, County Kildare). The Fragmentary Annals report {{that many of the}} men of Munster had not wished to set out on the expedition. This was because Flaithbertach <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> his horse at the muster, an event which was taken to be an ill-omen. Flann and his allies subsequently defeated the Munstermen. Cormac, along with Cellach mac Cerbaill of Osraige and many other notables, was killed.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> his horse.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{hailed as}} one of the {{greatest}} upsets in college football history, the game served as the lead story of SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated. Appalachian State became the second FCS team to defeat a ranked FBS team, and as a result of the game Michigan dropped out of the top 25 of the AP Poll entirely, marking the first time a team <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> the top five to out of the poll entirely as the result of a single game. In the aftermath of the game, the Associated Press amended their polling policy to make FCS teams eligible for the AP Poll, which had previously been limited to FBS teams.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite the government having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|Momolo Mortara died in 1871, {{shortly after}} {{spending}} seven {{months in prison}} during his trial {{over the death of}} a servant girl who <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> the window of his apartment. He had been found guilty of murdering her by the Florentine court of appeal, but then acquitted by the court of assizes. Pope Pius IX died in 1878. The same year Marianna travelled to Perpignan in south-western France, where she had heard Edgardo was preaching, and enjoyed an emotional reunion with her son, who was pleased to see her, but disappointed when she refused his pleas to convert to Catholicism. Edgardo thereafter attempted to re-establish connections with his family, but not all of his relatives were as receptive to him as his mother.|$|E

5|$|Norway Airlines lost NOK32 to 33 {{million in}} 1991. Norway Airlines {{replaced}} its two 737-300 aircraft with two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft leased from Transwede, one MD-83 and one MD-87. For {{the owners of}} the Boeing aircraft the move meant that they had to find a new lessee in a marketed where leasing prices <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> US$250,000 to US$150–180,000 per month. An interlining agreement was signed by Norway Airlines in March with British Airways and 25 other airlines at Gatwick. Norway Airlines announced on 15 March that it would take over the 25 Sterling employees in Norway in October. TransNordic Group started negotiations in June with Braathens SAFE, Maersk Air and Conair of Scandinavia for them to join the alliance. Prior to the roll-out of Amadeus reservation system in July 1992, Norway Airlines had not been included in the default searched of travel agents, who had to phone the airline to get a price quote.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that Randy Lerner, then {{owner of the}} National Football League's Cleveland Browns, had reached an agreement of £62.6million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. A statement released on 25 August to the LSE announced that Lerner had secured 59.69% of Villa shares, making him the majority shareholder. He also appointed himself Chairman of the club. In Ellis's last year in charge Villa lost £8.2m before tax, compared with a £3m profit the previous year, and income <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> £51.6m to £49m. Lerner took full control on 18 September, as he had 89.69% of the shares. On 19 September 2006, Ellis and his board resigned to be replaced with a new board headed by Lerner. Lerner installed Charles Krulak as a non-executive director and Ellis was awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus.|$|E

It rose to 238,000 tons in 1850, then resumed its decline: 146,000 tons in 1860, 82,000 tons in 1870 and 24,000 tons in 1878. Until {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{municipality}} of Givors held that the canal was essential to development of the town, and that barge traffic was still a viable industry, fighting against closure of the canal and demanding that it remain navigable for its entire length despite mounting evidence that it was obsolete. However, by 1881, {{it was clear that the}} canal was in poor shape. The natural shores were eroded and the sides of locks 1–32 needed to be completely rebuilt. From locks 32 to 35 the canal was mostly silted up and in some places had disappeared completely, taken over by vegetable gardens.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon, {{the medieval}} chronicler, {{wrote a letter}} {{entitled}} De contemptu mundi where he related a story from right before Bloet's death that Bloet felt he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> King Henry's favour. Bloet allegedly told Huntingdon that the bishop had lost two lawsuits. However, the whole letter is concerned with setting out examples of prominent men who suffered a fall from grace, so possible bias on Huntingdon's part must be kept in mind. There are also records of two legal proceedings involving Bloet {{at the end of}} Bloet's life, and although Bloet lost both cases, neither was a loss of much income or prestige. In one, he was allowed to continue to hold the property, although instead of it being judged as his land alone, the settlement was that Bloet held it of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. The other lawsuit involved Bloet's attempt to hold a manor free of dues owed to Westminster Abbey, which was settled in the Abbey's favour, although Bloet continued to hold the land. Nor is there any lessening of the rate of Bloet's witnessing to royal documents. It appears that Bloet's lost lawsuits were decided by other royal justices, and while he may have lost some favour with the king, he did not fall completely out of favour either.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, after a ten-day {{passage from}} Naples, Nelson joined the {{blockade}} squadron in HMS Vanguard accompanied by HMS Minotaur. On 28 October, Ball successfully completed {{negotiations with the}} French garrison on the small island of Gozo, the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring the island, its fortifications, 24 cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and 3,200 sacks of flour to the British. Although the island was formally claimed by King Ferdinand of Naples, it was administered by British and Maltese representatives, whose first action was to distribute the captured food supplies to the island's 16,000 inhabitants. Malta and the surrounding islands were not self-sufficient and quickly the challenge of feeding the population became a strain on the islands' resources, particularly with so many men under arms, Although now formally {{in command of the}} islands, King Ferdinand refused to assist with supplies, and the responsibility was left to Ball and his captains to arrange for the transport of supplies from Italy. By the end of the year, the number of Maltese troops in the field <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>from</b> 10,000 to 1,500, supported by 500 British and Portuguese marines from the blockade squadron. The blockade fleet, consisting of five British and four Portuguese ships, operated from St. Paul's Bay and Marsa Sirocco (now Marsaxlokk) on the island of Malta itself.|$|E
