6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> {{you been}} married before your husband had that chain-coat?" [...] said Romola, her heart beating faster and faster.|$|E
6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> the {{carriage}} been back from taking Miss June to the station? Since two? Then {{let him come}} round at half-past six! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't {{such a bad}} clew!" [...] Josie quickly returned, {{sitting up}} {{straight}} and staring reflectively at the old gentleman. [...] "Miss Gorham, eh? Now, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> she been Alora's governess?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>Long</b> (<b>Have</b> We Known Each Other Now) (vocal: Blixa Bargeld, Anita Lane) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you known her? — I {{have known}} her since {{childhood}} ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> {{you been}} working here? — I {{have been working}} here for three years ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You two {{are going}} off there together? I should say it proved just the contrary. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> you known her, may I ask, when this {{interesting}} project was formed? You haven't been twenty-four {{hours in the}} house." ...|$|E
60|$|The captain threw a {{quick glance}} at the print, and then, falling into reverie, with his hands crossed behind him, paced the little chamber, and was soon lost in {{thoughts}} which made him unconscious <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> elapsed when the maiden summoned him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had left}} the stage and she stood alone. She spoke his name. In the single low word he divined fear. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> she been that dog's wife? When had she married him? Yesterday, or the day before--a week, what did it matter? ...|$|E
3000|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> {{you been}} working as a sub-examiner with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mary, my dear, sit down,' said Mr. Pickwick, cutting short these compliments. 'Now then; <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> {{you been}} married, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But some of {{them grow}} high. You must be a mountaineer. Pardon my curiosity--it is inexcusable--but <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you lived here?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was over. The shrieks {{had died}} away into moans; the moans to silence. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he been there? An hour, or an eternity? Thank God it was over! For her sake--but for theirs? But they thought not {{of that as}} a new cry rose through the dome.|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he {{been there}} looking at me, appraising me in my {{unguarded}} day-dreaming state? I {{would have been more}} disconcerted if, having the clock set {{in the top of the}} mirror-frame right in front of me, I had not noticed that its long hand had hardly moved at all.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{his head}} grew clearer. He tried to think. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he? Not {{more than twenty}} minutes at the outside. Well, death was sure and he would meet it bravely. But to wait--to wait helplessly! He should go; mad with the horror of it before those endless minutes would have passed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!--Robert Gregory dead!" [...] Miss Harmer exclaimed, greatly astonished; [...] "I {{had no idea}} of that. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>has</b> he been dead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' {{the captain}} said, 'I suppose so; that's the story {{each of the}} prisoners tells. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you been with them?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am prepared," [...] he murmured, half to himself. [...] "Father, {{according}} to the physician's reckoning, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> I to live?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{it was all}} plain sailing now. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> {{it needed}} to win her--three years? He had loved her for three years. Well, he would have his reward; and then, his passion satisfied, he would turn his mind to those far-reaching, ambitious schemes, whereof the end was {{something}} like a throne.|$|E
60|$|When {{she woke}} at last {{it seemed as}} if a new day had come on the earth. How long, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> she fought through the dust and obscurity, for this new dawn? How frail and fine and clear she felt, like the most fragile flower that opens in the end of winter. But the pole of night was turned and the dawn was coming in.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed her}} hands over her face, and hair, and dress. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> it lasted? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> they been out here? And she began slowly moving back towards the house. Thank God! She had not yielded to fear or pity, not uttered falsities, not pretended she could love him, and betrayed her heart. That would have been the one {{unbearable}} thing to have been left remembering! She stood long looking down, as if trying to see the future in her dim flower-beds; then, bracing herself, hurried to the house. No one was on the veranda, no one in the drawing-room. She looked at the clock. Nearly eleven. Ringing for the servant to shut the windows, she stole up to her room. Had her husband gone away as he had come? Or would she presently again be face to face with that dread, the nerve of which never stopped aching now, dread of the night when he was near? She determined not to go to bed, and drawing a long chair to the window, wrapped herself in a gown, and lay back.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pray <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> they taken little imps like thee {{into their}} counsels?' demanded Eustace, {{as we all}} sat petrified at this announcement.|$|R
6000|$|ERMYNTRUDE [raising {{the cover}} from the tea cake {{and looking at}} it]. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>has</b> that been {{standing}} {{at the top of}} the stairs? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And yet you {{deliberately}} break one of {{the most}} important rules of the School. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you been in the habit of smoking?' ...|$|R
60|$|But I wander from M'Guire. From this dread glance {{into the}} past and future, his {{thoughts}} returned at a bound upon the present. How had he wandered there? and how long--O heavens! <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he been about it? He pulled out his watch; and found that but three minutes had elapsed. It seemed too bright a thing to be believed. He glanced at the church clock; and sure enough, it marked an hour four minutes {{in advance of the}} watch.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to prevent that ghostly Chinaman from materializing {{suddenly}} {{at the foot of}} the stairs, or anywhere, at any moment, and toppling him over with a dead sure shot. The danger was so irremediable that it was not worth worrying about, any more than the general precariousness of human life. Heyst speculated on this added risk. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he been at the mercy of a slender yellow finger on the trigger? That is, if that was the fellow's reason for purloining the revolver.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} pause. Did the man mean {{to take the}} thing coolly? Did he after all know? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he been in the room? Yet even {{at the moment when}} they heard the door, their attitudes. [...] . Horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. [...] "Of course," [...] he said, [...] "I promised to show you the works under their proper {{dramatic}} conditions. It's odd how I could have forgotten." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, they say,' {{returned}} his wife, 'that listeners never hear any good of themselves; though you--but pray <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you been here, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are ill, dear,' said Lady Annabel, {{taking her}} hand. 'Your hand is hot; you are feverish. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>has</b> my Venetia felt ill?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious mercy! <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you known this?" [...] cries {{the other}} lady (thinking perhaps {{that the old}} Marchioness was {{wandering}} in her wits).|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he slept? What {{was that}} sound of pattering feet? And that rise and fall, like {{the murmur of}} {{breakers}} on pebbles? He put out a languid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass. This was so unexpected that it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position. The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak--and amazed.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Julia, putting on {{her shoes and}} stockings, went to the fence and watched the man's shining white shirt as he moved across the cornfield. There had never been any special tenderness between them, but she had always liked him. They had been at school together. She wondered why he had come back {{at this time of}} the year, and wondered how long he would stay. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> he stood looking at her? She flushed again at the thought of it. But he wasn't to blame; it was a public road. She might have known better.|$|E
60|$|She {{fell asleep}} presently, and woke with a start. There, in {{a glimmer of}} pale light, stood the little model, as in the fatal picture Bianca had painted of her. Her face was powder white, with shadows beneath the eyes. Breath seemed coming through her parted lips, just touched with colour. In her hat lay the tiny peacock's feather beside the two purplish-pink roses. A scent came from her, too--but faint, as ever was the scent of chicory flower. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>had</b> she been {{standing}} there? Bianca started to her feet, and as she rose the vision vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... “ ‘Gracious mercy! <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you known this?’ ” cries {{the other}} lady (thinking perhaps {{that the old}} marchioness was {{wandering}} in her wits).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Pinnegar. [...] "I'm glad {{we still}} count for something, {{in spite of}} the greater attractions. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you in England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What? for {{a little}} bullyin'--same as you've been givin' Clewer! <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>have</b> you been jestin' with him?" [...] said Stalky. [...] "All this term?" ...|$|R
