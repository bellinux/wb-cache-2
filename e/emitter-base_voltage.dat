2500|$|In {{analog circuit}} design, the current-control view is {{sometimes}} used {{because it is}} approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately [...] times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the <b>emitter–base</b> <b>voltage</b> is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers–Moll) model is required. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function {{to be taken into}} account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers–Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I–V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.|$|E
50|$|The {{collector}} depletion region {{also increases}} under reverse bias, more than does {{that of the}} base, because the collector is less heavily doped. The principle governing these two widths is charge neutrality. The narrowing of the collector {{does not have a}} significant effect as the collector is much longer than the base. The emitter-base junction is unchanged because the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>voltage</b> is the same.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the spin-dependent transport properties of GaMnAs-based three-terminal semiconductor spin hot-carrier transistor (SSHCT) structures. The <b>emitter-base</b> bias <b>voltage</b> VEB dependence of the collector current IC, emitter current IE, and base current IB shows that the current transfer ratio alpha (= IC / IE) and the current gain beta (= IC / IB) are 0. 8 - 0. 95 and 1 - 10, respectively, which means that GaMnAs-based SSHCTs have current amplifiability. In addition, we observed an oscillatory behavior of the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio with the increasing bias, which {{can be explained by}} the resonant tunneling effect in the GaMnAs quantum well.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2005 American Institute of PhysicsDouble-barrier {{magnetic}} tunnel junctions (DBMTJs) {{of composition}} Co/AlOx/Co/AlOx/Ni 81 Fe 19 have been fabricated by magnetron sputtering through shadow masks. Two terminal measurements made upon the individual tunnel barriers revealed nonlinear Iâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 V curves and significant room-temperature tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in all cases. Measurements were also performed with connections made {{to all three}} electrodes. The TMR of a particular tunnel barrier within the DBMTJ can be strongly modified by applying a bias voltage to the other barrier, while the TMR measured across the two barriers in series decreases more slowly with increasing bias voltage than for a single barrier. With zero bias applied between the central Co base electrode and the Co collector electrode, the collector current was measured as electrons were injected from the Ni 81 Fe 19 electrode. For structures grown on Si/SiO 2 substrates, the collector current showed a nonmonotonic dependence upon the <b>emitter-base</b> bias <b>voltage,</b> and collector magnetocurrent values in excess of 100...|$|R

With the Co base and Ta collector connected together via a small resistor, the collector current contains contributions first from hot electrons injected from the Ni 81 Fe 19 emitter, and second from a geometrical artifact that leads to tunneling from the Fermi level in the base. Both sources of collector current lead to a room temperature magnetocurrent effect.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{impact ionization}} phenomena in advanced polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors. Two intrinsic limitations affecting multiplication coefficient at high electric fields are discussed. Emission microscopy is adopted to directly investigate and observe current crowding effects at {{the basis of}} the first kind of instability, which takes place when the device is driven at constant emitter current I(E). The second kind of instability consists in the snap-back of the collector current I(C) when the device is driven at constant <b>emitter-base</b> <b>voltage</b> V(EB) and can be explained by a simple model which takes into account the voltage drop induced by negative base current on the base spreading resistance...|$|E

40|$|A 1. 2 -kV/ 24 -A SiC-MOSFET and a 1. 2 -kV/ 30 -A Si-Insulated gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) have been electrothermally stressed in unclamped inductive switching conditions at different ambient temperatures ranging from - 25 °C to 125 °C. The devices have been stressed with avalanche currents at their rated currents and 40 % higher. The {{activation of the}} parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) during avalanche mode conduction results from the increased body resistance causing a voltage drop between the source and body, greater than the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>voltage</b> of the parasitic BJT. Because the BJT current and temperature relate through a positive feedback mechanism, thermal runaway results {{in the destruction of}} the device. It is shown that the avalanche power sustained before the destruction of the device increases as the ambient temperature decreases. SiC MOSFETs are shown to be able to withstand avalanche currents equal to the rated forward current at 25 °C, whereas IGBTs cannot sustain the same electrothermal stress. SiC MOSFETs are also shown to be capable of withstanding avalanche currents 40 % above the rated forward current though only at reduced temperatures. An electrothermal model has been developed to explain the temperature dependency of the BJT latchup, and the results are supported by finite-element models...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} sub- 1 V {{voltage reference}} generator, designed in standard 90 -nm CMOS technology, {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed voltage reference circuit consists of a conventional bandgap core based {{on the use of}} p-n-p substrate vertical bipolar devices and a voltage-to-current converter. The former produces a current with a positive temperature coefficient (TC), whereas the latter translates the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>voltage</b> of the core p-n-p bipolar device to a current with a negative TC. The circuit includes two operational amplifiers with a rail-to-rail output stage for enabling stable and robust operation overall process and supply voltage variations while it employs a total resistance of less than 600 ?K O. Detailed analysis is presented to demonstrate that the proposed circuit technique enables die area reduction. The presented voltage reference generator exhibits a PSRR of 52. 78 ?dB and a TC of 23. 66 ppm/degrees C in the range of - 40 and 125 degrees C at the typical corner case at 1 ?V. The output reference voltage of 510 ?mV achieves a total absolute variation of +/- 3. 3 % overall process and supply voltage variations and a total standard deviation, s, of 4. 5 ?mV, respectively, in the temperature range of - 36 and 125 degrees C.
