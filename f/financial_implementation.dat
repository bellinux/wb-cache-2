40|$|Photocatalysis is {{a process}} by which {{materials}} can transfer light energy into chemical {{energy in the form}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can then oxidize chemical and biological contaminants in water. Whereas photocatalysis offers the potential to treat many recalcitrant priority pollutants in a cost-effective manner, it has yet to become a viable, wide-spread treatment option due to implementation barriers that include limitations in treatment efficiency and relatively high costs of some photocatalytic material. This thesis seeks to increase the applicability and understanding of nanomaterial-enhanced photocatalytic oxidation processes to help overcome these barriers. Increased photocatalytic efficiency can be accomplished through informed choice of ROS-producing materials. For example, hydroxyl radicals are shown to be much more susceptible to hindrance by natural organic matter (NOM), phosphate and wastewater treatment plant effluent than 1 O 2, which is only slightly inhibited by NOM and not by phosphate or wastewater effluent. Additionally, a novel crystallization mechanism for photocatalytic TiO 2 nanotubes enabled photo-production of multiple ROS types. This “cocktail” of reactive oxygen species contributed to increased efficiency. Novel applications for nanotechnology-enhanced photocatalysis were demonstrated at the lab scale. These include (1) photocatalytic pre-treatment of weathered oil from the 2010 Gulf oil spill, which increased soluble organic carbon content (indicative of increased bioavailability) by 60 % and enhanced subsequent biodegradation by 37 %; and (2) a water disinfection case study in rural Swaziland, which produced a prototype fluidized bed photoreactor capable of removing 99. 9 % of bacteria and viruses in 60 cycles), and utilization of less-purified starting materials (> 90 % cost reduction) highlight possible ways to reduce the cost of nanomaterial photocatalysis. By reducing <b>financial</b> <b>implementation</b> barriers, defining niches where photocatalysis can be superiorly effective, engineering reactor systems that enable real-world testing of this technology, and increasing understanding of photocatalytic inhibition mechanisms, photocatalysis can become a tool to help solve global water challenges...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXTO: Apesar de reconhecer que o número apresentado pelo mutirão de cirurgias eletivas não refletisse inteiramente a realidade, foi significativa a implementação financeira do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, bem como o aumento de cirurgias de varizes, após criação do Fundo de Ações Estratégias e Compensação (FAEC). OBJETIVO: Avaliar os resultados da aplicação do investimento financeiro do Ministério da Saúde no mutirão de cirurgias de varizes. MÉTODOS:Foi realizado um estudo {{transversal}} de natureza retrospectiva, utilizando informações do banco de dados do Departamento de Informática do Sistema Único de Saúde. Foram incluídas na pesquisa todas autorizações de internação hospitalar das cirurgias de varizes de membros inferiores pagas pelo Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, no período {{de janeiro}} de 1998 a dezembro de 2004. RESULTADOS: Em 1998, antes da implementação do mutirão de cirurgias eletivas foram realizadas 23. 531 cirurgias de varizes e investidos R$ 5. 819. 033, 27. Após a criação do FAEC, foram realizadas 457. 026 cirurgias de varizes de membros inferiores, no período de 1999 a 2004, e foram investidos R$ 187. 760. 196, 81 com média de R$ 31. 293. 336, 13 por ano. CONCLUSÃO: O investimento feito pelo Ministério da Saúde durante o programa de mutirões de cirurgias eletivas pelo FAEC, proporcionou aumento significativo do número de cirurgias de varizes em todo Brasil. BACKGROUND: In {{spite of the}} fact that the number of surgeries presented by the elective surgery task force did not entirely reflect the reality, it is possible to declare that the <b>financial</b> <b>implementation</b> of the Brazilian Ministry of Health has been significative, as well as the increasing number of varicose vein surgeries, especially after the creation of the Strategic Actions and Compensation Fund (FAEC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of financial investment in the Ministry of Health campaign for varicose vein surgery. METHODS: A transversal study of retrospective nature has been conducted, using information available at the Data Processing Department of the National Healthcare System database (DATASUS). All the authorization of hospital internment from the inferior member varicose vein surgeries, financed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health from January 1998 to December 2004, have been included in the research. RESULTS: In 1998, before the implementation of the elective surgery task force, 23, 531 varicose vein surgeries have been performed, and R$ 5, 819, 033. 27 invested. After the creation of the FAEC, 457, 026 inferior member varicose vein surgeries have been performed from 1999 to 2004, and R$ 187, 760, 196. 81 were invested with an average of R$ 31, 293, 336. 13 per year.
