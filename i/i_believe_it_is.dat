5000|$|In {{his first}} public remarks as NSA director, Rogers stated that he {{believed}} that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was [...] "probably not" [...] working for a foreign intelligence agency, despite frequent speculation and assertion by the NSA's allies to the contrary. Rogers added: [...] "He clearly believes in what he's doing. I question that; I don't agree with it. I fundamentally disagree with what he did. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> wrong; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> illegal." ...|$|R

(Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E
500|$|British Foreign Secretary William Hague {{announced}} Norgrove's death. In {{a written}} statement, {{he said that}} after receiving information on her location it was [...] "decided that, given the danger she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on that information." [...] Prime Minister Cameron defended the rescue attempt: [...] "Decisions on operations to free hostages are always difficult. But where a British life is in such danger, and where we and our allies can act, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> right to try".|$|E

500|$|Darwin also {{observed}} a luminous [...] "jelly-fish {{of the genus}} Dianaea" [...] and noted that [...] "When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> generally owing to minute crustacea. But {{there can be no}} doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent." [...] He guessed that [...] "a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere" [...] was probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin [...] "was lucky with most of his guesses, but not here", noting that biochemistry was too little known, and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved [...] "would have been too much for comfort".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an opinion}} piece for Foreign Policy, Max Boot {{outlines}} his views thusly: [...] "I am socially liberal: I am pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-abortion rights, pro-immigration.

I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{next day}} Michael Morell, former deputy {{director}} and twice {{acting director of}} the Central Intelligence Agency, resigned as a nonresident senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] Morell wrote, [...] "I cannot be part of an organization—The Kennedy School—that honors a convicted felon and leaker of classified information … the Kennedy School's decision will assist Ms. Manning in her long-standing effort to legitimize the criminal path that she took to prominence, an attempt that may encourage others to leak classified information as well." [...] Later that day, CIA director Mike Pompeo advised the university that he supported Morell's decision, and withdrew from his scheduled public appearance that evening at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Calling Manning an [...] "American traitor," [...] Pompeo wrote, [...] "While I have served my country as a soldier in the United States Army and will continue to defend Ms. Manning's right to offer a defense of why she chose this path, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> shameful for Harvard to place its stamp of approval upon her treasonous actions." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 30, 2013, Kanye West {{unveiled}} the simplistic standard and deluxe edition album covers via his Twitter account. On September 21, 2013, Pusha T released snippets {{for the standard}} edition tracks. On September 27, 2013, Pusha T released the music video for the intro track [...] "King Push". On October 2, 2013, {{after a few days}} of being credited as a co-producer of [...] "King Push", Joaquin Phoenix denied having assist in producing the song. He said, [...] "While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can't take any credit. A friend's son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye's camp." [...] On October 3, 2013, during an interview with Rap-Up, Pusha T revealed that it was actually the son of Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich who produced the song, saying [...] "Joaquin Phoenix gave the beat to 'Ye, so when I got the beat from 'Ye, it was, Yo, Joaquin gave me this beat. So me, I'm just like, OK, I know Joaquin's into music and you know the whole thing, so I'm like, Oh, damn. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the son of Lars Ulrich from Metallica.

500|$|There, {{near the}} parade square, in March 1964, while viewing the college flag atop the Mackenzie Building, Stanley, then RMC's Dean of Arts, first {{suggested}} to Matheson, then Member of Parliament for Leeds, that the RMC flag should {{form the basis}} of the national flag. The suggestion was followed by Stanley's memorandum of March 23, 1964, on the history of Canada's emblems, in which he warned that any new flag [...] "must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature" [...] {{and that it would be}} [...] "clearly inadvisable" [...] to create a flag that carried the Union Jack or a fleur-de-lis. According to Matheson, Pearson's one [...] "paramount and desperate objective" [...] in introducing the new flag was to keep Quebec in the Canadian union. It was Dr. Stanley's idea that the new flag should be red and white and that it should feature the single maple leaf; his memorandum included the first sketch of what would become the flag of Canada. Stanley and Matheson collaborated on a design that was ultimately, after six months of debate and 308 speeches, passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons on December 15, 1964. Just after this, at 2:00 am, Matheson wrote to Stanley: [...] "Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an excellent flag that will serve Canada well." [...] The Senate added its approval two days later.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{questions}} in the lead-up to the war was whether the United Nations Security Council would authorize military intervention in Iraq. It became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections. Many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. Robin Cook, then {{the leader of the}} United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair's cabinet in protest over the UK's decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: [...] "In principle <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> against Britain's interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action." ...|$|E

In an interview, Murakami stated [...] "The issue of historical understanding carries great significance, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important that Japan makes straightforward apologies.
