After {{a certain point}} in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks.|$|E
500|$|A genet is a {{group of}} genetically {{identical}} individuals that <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given location, all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor. Once established, genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae. In field studies, the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site, determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility (a method fungi use to distinguish self from non-self by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species) or various molecular techniques, and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies. In a 1996 study, mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S.pungens, an abundant fruiter in pine forests, would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees. However, by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above-ground fruit bodies, they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying {{only a small fraction of}} the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage, which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina. Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below-ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting, or alternatively, because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting. A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S.pungens genets, and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet. This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth, rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores, and that it uses carbon resources efficiently. The study also described an S.pungens genet with an area of approximately [...] and a span greater than [...] across, which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported. The large S.pungens genet was not detected after wildfire, demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host, and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire.|$|E

50|$|Suillus pungens is an ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{basidiomycete}} {{that forms}} symbiotic relationships almost exclusively with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and bishop pine (Pinus muricata); some collections {{have been made}} under knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but only {{within the range of}} Monterey pine. All these trees have small scattered natural ranges largely restricted to California. An EM symbiosis is a mutualistic relationship between an EM fungus and the root tip of a compatible EM plant. The fruit bodies of Suillus pungens grow solitarily, scattered or in groups in humus. They are often found growing near fruit bodies of Chroogomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa. Suillus pungens is often the most abundant Suillus in the San Francisco Bay Area. The type collection was made on the campus of San Francisco State University in San Francisco, where it occurs in abundance during the fall and winter seasons. Although it occurs most frequently in the autumn and winter, {{it is one of the}} few species of Suillus that continue to fruit sporadically throughout the year, especially in wet weather.

In order to address this problem, hard tissue histology is reviewed paying particular attention to the relationships during growth of the component hard tissues comprising conodont elements, and ignoring a priori assumptions of the homologies of these tissues. Conodont element growth is considered further in terms of the pattern of formation, of which four distinct types are described, all possibly derived from a primitive condition after heterochronic changes in the timing of various developmental stages. It is hoped that this may provide further means of unravelling conodont phylogeny.

40|$|International audienceMany {{controversial}} {{questions about}} the shape and evolution of city size distributions can be solved if reliable, large and comparable set of date are used for several countries. We provide new empirical evidence by using the large data base ‘Geopolis’, which has strictly comparable figures for all towns and cities of the world over 10000 inhabitants between 1950 and 1990. A Pareto model is used for identifying as metropolises {{one or a few}} large cities for each national urban system. From those data, two empirical power laws are established, linking the size of the metropolises to the size of their national urban system. The first is a transversal law : for a set of countries at a given date, the share of population concentrated in metropolises tends to decrease when larger countries are considered. The second law, which is longitudinal, shows that metropolises in the past <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> systematic way more rapidly than the rest of their urban system, invalidating Gibrat’s urban growth model.

Second, the fibrous diamond could have grown in an upcoming kimberlite that paused, so that the diamond could remain in the stability field of diamond in the upper mantle, and grow an octahedral layer; then, a second kimberlite transportation brought the whole diamond up to the surface. Third, the diamond could have grown from a single reservoir, e. g. a kimberlite fluid front, initially very favorable to diamond growth (fast, fibrous growth), but becoming progressively less favorable, so that the growth mode at some critical point switched to the slower layered growth...|$|E

Myriad studies have documented the pervasiveness of the luxury market in the West and the high growth and strong potential of Asian luxury markets. It is also evident that as resources <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> region, luxury {{consumption and}} the desire for luxury products have followed. Nevertheless, the need for more far-reaching studies that explore emerging markets are important to understand the differences in how luxury may penetrate these markets, given variations in resources and culture. This paper investigates a number of factors that may contribute to the emergence of new luxury markets. Specifically, the authors focus on the psychology of luxury consumption in the post-revolution Tunisian market. In particular, this research attempts to understand the psychology behind the consumption of luxury items in Tunisia and provide managerial insights into strategies for entry into such emerging markets. The empirical data was collected using online surveys of participants from French-speaking Tunisia. Overall, this analysis of the Tunisian market for branded products and services informs international luxury managers in developing their strategies to penetrate emerging markets. Besides the managerial insights that the results provide, the hypotheses tested in this paper relating luxury consumption to the variables of age, income, and education within the framework of national culture are important contributions from the theoretical standpoint...|$|E

Managing and enabling technological growth is among the top priorities of the organizations today. To meet this priority, organizations must create reliable, secure and cost-effective infrastructures that enable business innovation. Technological management not only includes a pool of up-to-date and state-of-the-art tangible and intangible technological resources, but innovation adoptions, technological road mapping and forecasting with proper time lining are also key ingredients of technology management. Technology management demands a futuristic approach from the companies. The companies have to look forward towards the upcoming technologies that are in the research pipeline and have to strategize their business expansion plans in the light of these developments. Telecommunication sector has seen a boom world over as never seen before and South Asia is no exception in this telecommunication revolution. The infrastructural growth in many of the countries in South Asian region such as India and Pakistan has been iconic.

This is the case for protein folding, for which a significant amount of data are being collected. This paper reports on the essential role of in silico methods and the unprecedented interplay of computational and theoretical approaches, which is a defining point of the interdisciplinary investigations of the protein folding process. Besides giving an overview of the available computational methods and tools, we argue that computation plays not merely an ancillary role but has a more constructive function in that computational work may precede theory and experiments. More precisely, computation can provide the primary conceptual clues to inspire subsequent theoretical and experimental work even in a case where no preexisting evidence or theoretical frameworks are available. This is cogently manifested in the application of machine learning methods {{to come to grips with}} the folding dynamics. These close relationships suggested complementing the review of computational methods within the appropriate theoretical context to provide a self-contained outlook of the basic concepts that have converged into a unified description of folding and <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> synergic relationship with their computational counterpart.
