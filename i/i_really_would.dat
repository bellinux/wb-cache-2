It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|However, the demo tape {{circulated}} {{in the music}} industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, he talked to former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. [...] "For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great", Grohl explained. [...] "But for everyone else, {{it would have been}} weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have been under the microscope." [...] Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based rock band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group's bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served as a touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album, In Utero, to join as the group's second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records.|$|E

6000|$|Of course, however, Albinia {{would not}} {{believe that she was}} tired, and began to talk of the Osborns and their party--she was annoyed at the being thought too fine.

6000|$|... "Oh, indeed I have, and a {{very good}} one. For all my talking in that way, I was never badly off for lovers, and now I've chosen one for good and all; and I love him dearly, Madame; dote on him, and so does he on me, but for all that {{there was a time when}} <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have eaten his heart, if I could have got at it." ...|$|E
60|$|His conduct has {{not been}} what I {{deserved}} at his hand, but, I believe that, walking blindfold himself, he misled me without malice prepense.

[...] "You see, {{it was very}} {{exciting}} when that barrel started rolling, and we knew by the sounds {{that there was some}} one inside it. I guess Reddy Fox forgot all about Peter. I know I did. And when the barrel broke to pieces against that stone down there, and you and Reddy faced each other, it was still more exciting. After it was over, I looked for Peter, but he was nowhere in sight. He hadn't had time to reach the Old Briar-patch. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> like to know myself what became of him." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was a {{proof of}} their {{complete}} recovery from Harris-Hartwigism that, {{while they were}} undressing, the Applebys discussed Mr. Hartwig only for a moment, and that Father volunteered: [...] "I actually do hope that Lulu and Harry will come to pay us a visit now. Maybe we can impress her, too. I hope so. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> like a chance to love our daughter a little. Don't seem natural we should {{always have to be}} scared of her. Well, let's forget the Hartwigs. They'll come around now. Catch them not knowing where their bread is buttered. Why, think, maybe Lulu will let me kiss her, some day, without criticizing my necktie while I'm doing it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm {{always saying}} that I {{have more than}} my share of fun and comfort and pretty things, and that I ought and will share them with some one. But I don't do it; and now and then, when I hear about real poverty, or dreadful sickness, I feel so wicked it quite upsets me. If I knew how to begin, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would.</b> But dirty little {{children}} don't come in my way, nor tipsy women to be reformed, nor nice lame girls to sing and pray with, as it all happens in books," [...] cried Marion Warren, with such a remorseful expression on her merry round face that her mates laughed with one accord.|$|E
6000|$|I settled it with myself, {{when she}} was gone, that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> ask Mr. Franklin--mainly to set Penelope's mind at rest.

But as I don't wish to raise your {{expectations}} and then disappoint them, I will take leave to warn you here--before we go any further--that you won't find {{the ghost of a}} joke in our conversation {{on the subject of the}} jugglers. To my great surprise, Mr. Franklin, like Penelope, took the thing seriously. How seriously, you will understand, when I tell you that, in his opinion, [...] "It" [...] meant the Moonstone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] the Duke assented. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I don't want {{anything}} {{in the nature of}} a house party. What <b>I</b> should <b>really</b> like <b>would</b> be to get Maiyo there almost to ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jaquetta {{was always}} ready to be delighted. Dear child, her head was full of log huts and Robinson Crusoe life, and cows to milk herself; and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> think she <b>would</b> have liked to go ashore in the Swiss family's eight tubs! ...|$|R

6000|$|Well, little Buzz and I lived {{together}} many weeks, and never {{got tired of}} one another, which is saying a good deal. At Christmas I went home {{for a week and}} left my room to take care of itself. I put the hyacinths into the closet to be warm, and dropped the curtain, so the frost should not nip my ivy; but I forgot Buzz. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> have taken him with me, or carried him down to a neighbour's room {{to be taken care of}} while I was away, but I never thought of him in the hurry of getting my presents and myself ready. Off I went without even saying 'good-bye,' and never thought of my little friend till Freddy, my small nephew, said to me one evening at dusk,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Ned, you {{certainly}} have deserved success, and I am indeed obliged {{to you for}} the immense trouble you have taken over the matter. It is too bad your spending your time over this annoying affair, when you are only home on a year's leave. What you have learned is, of course, no direct proof that Truscott has a hand in this affair; at the same time, what he said confirms to some extent your suspicions of him. Would it not be as well to put the search for him {{into the hands of}} a detective, now that there is some one definite to search for? One of these men might be useful, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>would</b> vastly rather employ one than know that you are spending day after day searching for him yourself.

Suddenly he was pushing his cause with youthful ardor. [...] "If you could only care for me!" [...] he cried.

Indeed, I would do everything that you wished me to--be as good as Reg--upon my word!" [...] Isabel raised startled eyes in mute entreaty. [...] "Let me finish," [...] the boy implored. [...] "I know just what you think, so please do not tell me. You have heard about the scrape at college, all about my getting fired, my father's anger, everything abominable. And it is true, all true,--I was an ass, a perfect ass. I admit it. But you see I'm different now. I can be a man, even if I didn't get through college by the skin of my teeth. If you would only marry me father would overlook everything! set me up {{in any kind of}} business I liked. And besides, 'the mater' has much more money than dad. She's simply crazy about you--almost as crazy as I am." ...|$|E
