Davis also awarded the album 3 out of 5, while Birchmeier was slightly more positive, awarding Faryl 3.5 out of 5.|$|E

25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than I have ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>Mother.</b> I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{think the}} movie is about mothers and sons," [...] Spacey said, {{referring}} to Darin's relationship with his mother Polly and sister Nina. Spacey's mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started. [...] "I made the movie for all mothers, but especially <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> She introduced me to Bobby Darin. When she got very ill in 2002, I stopped everything {{and took care of}} her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I'd let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I'm glad she passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make." [...] After his award-winning performances in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey [...] "chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men" [...] in films like Pay It Forward, K-PAX and The Shipping News. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated into folk music and protest songs.|$|E
500|$|Pete Paphides, {{writing for}} The Times, {{said that the}} songs were {{performed}} [...] "with power and restraint" [...] and that the [...] "arrangements by Jon Cohen suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist". He compared it favourably to three other Mothering Sunday releases: Lionel Richie's Just Go, Ronan Keating's Songs <b>for</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> and Barry Manilow's The Greatest Songs of the Eighties. He awarded Faryl 3 {{out of a possible}} 5, the highest rating of the four. Retailers in the United Kingdom ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week before release, which Simon Cable, writing for the Daily Mail, noted was more copies than U2's recent No Line on the Horizon. It also topped the Amazon.co.uk presale chart. On the day of the release the album was at the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart, based on presales alone. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The previous record holder had been Hayley Westenra's Pure. The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. Faryl officially entered the charts at number six and rose to fourth place the next week. The success of the album left Smith the third Britain's Got Talent contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Potts (with One Chance) and Johnston (with One Voice).|$|E

But he’s very easy to look after anyway, 'cause he’s very well behaved." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dresser {{continued}} to compose music {{during the height}} of his performing career. Between 1886 and 1893 he published nearly fifty songs, including [...] "The Letter That Never Came" [...] (1886), [...] "I Believe It <b>for</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> Told Me So" [...] (1887), and [...] "The Pardon that Came Too Late" [...] (1891). These early successes may have encouraged Dresser to pursue songwriting rather than performing. In addition, he may have realized that publishing music would provide even more financial success than composing or performing.|$|E
