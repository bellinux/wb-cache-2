40|$|The Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) {{revised the}} <b>Health</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>Food</b> Act in 2008 and {{extended}} {{the form of}} <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> to general food types. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate consumers' perceptions of the expanded form of <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>food</b> and to predict consumption patterns. For this study, 1, 006 male and female adults aged 19 years and older were selected nationwide by multi-stage stratified random sampling and were surveyed in 1 : 1 interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted by Korea Gallup. The subjects consisted of 497 (49. 4 %) males and 509 (50. 6 %) females. About 57. 9 % of the subjects recognized the KFDA's permission procedures for <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods.</b> Regarding the <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> that the subjects had consumed, red ginseng products were the highest (45. 3 %), followed by nutritional supplements (34. 9 %), ginseng products (27. 9 %), lactobacillus-containing products (21. 0 %), aloe products (20. 3 %), and Japanese apricot extract products (18. 4 %). Opinions on expanding the form of <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> to general food types scored 4. 7 points on a 7 -point scale, showing positive responses. In terms {{of the effects of}} medicine-type <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> versus generic <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> the highest response was 'same effects if the same ingredients are contained' at a rate of 34. 7 %. For intake frequency by food type, the response of 'daily consistent intake' was 31. 7 % for capsules, tablets, and pills, and 21. 7 % for extracts. For general food types, 'daily consistent intake' was 44. 5 % for rice and 22. 8 % for beverages, which were higher rates than those for medicine types. From the above results, consumers had positive opinions of the expansion of <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods</b> to generic forms but are not expected to maintain accurate intake frequencies or amounts. Thus, continuous promotion and education are needed for proper intake of generic <b>health</b> <b>functional</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for {{numerous}} metabolic diseases. Recently, naturally occurring compounds that may improve obesity have received increasing attention. Xanthigen is a mixture of fucoxanthin and punicic acid derived from brown seaweed and pomegranate seed, respectively, which have been tradi-tionally used for lipid-lowering effects in humans. In this study, we investigated whether Xanthigen attenuates high-fat diet-induced obesity in C 57 BL/ 6 N mice. The mice were fed on a normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD plus 1 % Xanthigen or HFD plus 1 % green tea extract (GTE) for 11 weeks. Food efficiency ratio (FER) and body weight were significantly reduced in mice fed HFD plus Xanthigen compared to HFD-fed mice. Consistent with the results in body weight change, Xanthigen also significantly decreased the weights of epididymal adipose tissue, retroperitoneal adipose tissue, and liver in HFD plus 1 % Xanthigen-fed mice. The serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol was significantly decreased in HFD plus Xanthigen-fed mice compared to HFD-fed mice.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGinseng {{has been}} used as a tonic for invigoration of the human body. In a {{previous}} report, we identified a novel candidate responsible for the tonic role of ginseng, designated gintonin. Gintonin induces [Ca 2 +]i transient in animal cells via lysophosphatidic acid receptor activation. Gintonin-mediated [Ca 2 +]i transient is linked to anti-Alzheimer's activity in transgenic Alzheimer's disease animal model. The previous method for gintonin preparation included multiple steps. The aim of this study is to develop a simple method of gintonin fraction with a high yield. MethodsWe developed a brief method to obtain gintonin using ethanol and water. We extracted ginseng with fermentation ethanol and fractionated the extract with water to obtain water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions. The water-insoluble precipitate, rather than the water-soluble supernatant, induced a large [Ca 2 +]i transient in primary astrocytes. We designated this fraction as gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF). ResultsThe yield of GEF was approximately 6 -fold higher than that obtained in the previous gintonin preparation method. The apparent molecular weight of GEF, determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was equivalent to that obtained in the previous gintonin preparation method. GEF induced [Ca 2 +]i transient in cortical astrocytes. The effective dose (ED 50) was 0. 3  ±  0. 09  μg/mL. GEF used the same signal transduction pathway as gintonin during [Ca 2 +]i transient induction in mouse cortical astrocytes. ConclusionBecause GEF can be prepared through water precipitation of ginseng ethanol extract and is easily reproducible with high yield, it could be commercially utilized for the development of gintonin-derived <b>functional</b> <b>health</b> <b>food</b> and natural medicine...|$|R

40|$|The local {{output value}} of {{functional}} foods market is estimated over 20 billion $NT dollars. Both the demand of functional foods for consumers and {{the marketing of}} <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> also have an increasing trend. Since the execution of <b>Health</b> <b>Food</b> Control Act, there have been 82 items of marketing <b>foods</b> certified as <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> from the Department of Health (DOH). Materials and processes with many <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> {{are different from those}} of common <b>foods.</b> <b>Functional</b> ingredients in <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> might interact with the system of drug absorption or metabolism, which might lead to unintended reactions including adverse events, increasing drug resistance and reinforcing medicine action. Consumers and producers are rarely sensitive to such hazards. Accordingly, it is imperative to search and collect unintended reactions (herb-, flavonoid-drug interactions) with <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> and their <b>functional</b> ingredients. According to in vitro, in vivo and clinical researches, health food-related phytochemicals such as herbs, dietary supplements and flavonoids can interact with many drugs, which affect actions of drug transporter system, drug-metabolizing enzymes and pharmacokinetics. At present, there is no such information source built locally. Researches on unintended reactions of domestically made <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> and their ingredients to drug metabolism are also dramatically needed. Therefore, this project aims to investigate researches on unintended reactions of <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> and their related phytochemicals as well as study on the drug-interaction of local <b>health</b> <b>foods</b> including items of lipoprotein and immunity regulating products. The first year of this project will cover researches and data survey on unintended reactions of <b>health</b> <b>food</b> and their related phytochemicals.

Currently dietary analysis of food intake data can be completed using <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> databases with very few users drawing on printed <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables. This study aimed to examine the nutrient output from different <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data tables from 1944 to 2007 and describe the challenges faced when applying it to a present day dietary intake dataset from 2013. A two-step process was applied to analyse baseline food record data from the feasibility study of an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention trial using <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> databases from 1944, 1948, 1954, 1968, 1977, 1991, 1999 and 2007. Differences in food data across all time points were determined with 2007 as the comparator database. Data were available for protein, fat, carbohydrate, thiamin, vitamin C, calcium and iron across the eight databases however nutrient data were not compared {{due to a lack}} of food matches between the databases. Differences in reported <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data over time emphasizes the importance of using timely <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data matched to the time period of the dietary intake data...|$|R
40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>composition</b> {{data are}} an {{essential}} yet often underutilized resource to help {{decision making and}} planning for nutrition programming and policy decisions. <b>Food</b> <b>composition</b> data could be used much more widely to inform {{a wide array of}} stakeholders within multiple sectors including agriculture, health, education and trade. This preconference session will explore how <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data can be used in nutrition programming as well as for influencing diverse national policies and social protection programmes. It will focus {{on a wide range of}} programmatic uses of <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data, including breeding for nutritional outcomes, selection of locally available foods for national programmes such as school feeding and use of intra-specific diversity to promote resilience and greater opportunities for dietary diversification. Case studies that illustrate diverse uses of <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data for nutrition programing and policy setting will be presented...|$|R
40|$|To {{promote and}} {{encourage}} interchange of <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data, the EUROFOODS {{working group on}} <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data management and interchange proposes a set of recommenda-tions for data management and interchange using electronic media. The recommendations are "rmly founded on previous work done internationally by INFOODS and by national agencies and institutes as well as international standards. The recommendations include guidelines for the description of foods, components, compositional values and data sources. A su$ciently generic conceptual schema for <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> is de"ned to handle <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> data at various levels of aggregation and with various levels of additional descriptive information. The recom-mendations also include technical issues such as "le formats and media for data interchange. Software tools are presented to assist with implementation of the recommendations.

40|$|Objective: The {{nutrition}} {{of children}} in kindergartens has a great significance for proper growth and development of children. In order to save time and money, the control of macronutrients content is performed by calculations using <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables instead of performing a chemical analysis. Methods: We examined the macronutrients content of 240 whole day meals using <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables and performed chemical analysis of meals to determine adequacy and validity of <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables in calculation of macronutrient contents in kindergarten meals. Findings: We established no correlation (P> 0. 05) between the value of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Significant difference was established between the average content of proteins (t= 2. 57; P 0. 05) (<b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables vs chemical analysis). Conclusion: Until we establish new <b>food</b> <b>composition</b> tables, chemical analysis remains the only valid method for assessment of macronutrients content and energy value of a meal in kindergarten...|$|R
40|$|Primary role of food is {{to provide}} nutritive stuffs in {{sufficient}} amounts to meet nutritive requirements. However, recent scientific findings confirm assumptions that particular food or its ingredients had positive physiological and psychological effects on <b>health.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>food</b> is referred to food rich in ingredients, having beneficial effects on one or more functions in an organism. By consuming functional food consumers can expect some health benefits. Production of poultry products as functional food is getting more important on foreign markets while portion of such products on domestic food market is insignificant. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present possibilities for enrichment of poultry products, such as broiler and turkey meat and chicken eggs, as they can be characterized as functional food. Functional ingredients in poultry products are polyunsaturated fatty acids (LNA, EPA and DHA) and antioxidants. Enrichment of poultry products with the stated ingredients that are beneficial for human health is subject of many researches, and only recently have researches been directed towards assessment of market sustainability of such products...|$|R
40|$|The {{role for}} {{lifestyle}} modifications to correct dyslipidemia(s) is reviewed. Dietary composition is crucial. Replacing saturated fat with MUFA or n- 6 PUFA lowers plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol and ameliorates the LDL/HDL ratio. Replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates has diverging effects {{due to the}} heterogeneity of carbohydrate foods. Diets rich in refined carbohydrates increase fasting and postprandial triglycerides, whereas the consumption of fiber-rich, low GI foods lowers LDL cholesterol with no detrimental effects on triglycerides. The role of polyphenols is debated: available evidence suggests a lowering effect of polyphenol-rich foods on postprandial triglycerides. As for <b>functional</b> <b>foods,</b> <b>health</b> claims on a cholesterol lowering effect of psyllium, beta-glucans and phytosterols are accepted by regulatory agencies. The importance of alcohol intake, weight reduction, and physical activity is discussed. In conclusion, {{there is evidence that}} lifestyle affects plasma lipid. A multifactorial approach including multiple changes with additive effects is the best option. This may also ensure feasibility and durability. The traditional Mediterranean way of life can represent a useful model...|$|R
