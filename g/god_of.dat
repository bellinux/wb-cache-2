It was praised by critics {{as the best way}} to experience the series' musical development, and allows the listener to note the development of the composers during the series.|$|E
5|$|Aphrodite– The Goddess of Love and Sexuality, and {{widow of}} Hephaestus. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, Aphrodite helped Kratos by {{empowering}} {{the head of}} the slain Medusa and giving it to Kratos as a magical weapon. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III, she offered advice regarding the architect Daedalus. After seducing Kratos, Aphrodite directed him to her estranged husband. She is the only god that Kratos did not kill that was present in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III. The character was voiced by Carole Ruggier in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, and April Stewart in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III.|$|E
5|$|Ares– The former <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

Hermes participated in the Olympian wager in the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War comic series by {{choosing}} Danaus to be his champion. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III, Hermes taunted Kratos about murdering his family during Kratos' assault on Mount Olympus, leading to a chase through the city of Olympia.

5|$|Poseidon– The former <b>God</b> <b>of</b> the Sea. Poseidon {{also participated}} in the Olympian wager in the <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War comic series by {{choosing}} Herodius as his champion. Herodius was killed by Kratos, causing Poseidon to release his hippocampus to destroy Kratos' ship, but Kratos and his men managed to escape. After becoming the champion of the gods, Poseidon later tasked Kratos with slaying the Hydra in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War and granted him the magic, Poseidon's Rage. Poseidon came to resent Kratos {{for his role in}} the destruction of Atlantis in Ghost of Sparta, and, in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III, he was killed by Kratos during the Spartan's assault on Olympus, which caused the oceans to flood the world. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Poseidon is one of the four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was originally voiced by Fred Tatasciore in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War.

5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War and <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War II, and Josh Keaton in <b>God</b> <b>of</b> War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians.

There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions {{for them to have}} arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a <b>god</b> <b>of</b> war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also <b>god</b> <b>of</b> pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
