25|$|The {{widespread}} strikes of 1980 were <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> first {{clashes between}} {{the ruling party}} and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a “socialist” government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty {{times that of the}} blue-collar worker. This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of independent union activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, sit-in strikes started up again.|$|E

2500|$|During the First Empire, Paris was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> City of Light. The main {{streets were}} dimly {{illuminated}} by 4,200 oil lanterns hung from posts, {{which could be}} lowered on a cord {{so they could be}} lit without a ladder. The number grew to 4,335 by 1807, but was still far from sufficient. One problem was {{the quantity and quality of}} the oil being supplied by private contractors; lamps did not burn all night, and often did not burn at all. Also, lamps were placed far apart, so much of the street remained in darkness. For this reason persons going home after the theater or who needed to travel through the city at night hired porte-falots, or torch-bearers, to illuminate their way. Napoleon was furious at the shortcoming: in May 1807, from his military headquarters in Poland, he wrote to Fouché, his Minister of Police, responsible for street lights: [...] "I've learned that the streets of Paris are no longer being lit." [...] (May 1); [...] "The non-lighting of Paris is becoming a crime, it's necessary to put an end to this abuse, because the public is beginning to complain." [...] (23 May).|$|E
2500|$|Critics noted, though, {{that history}} as such was {{secondary}} to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly {{by his own}} personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th century characters using mid-19th century moral values.

According to the author, historical drama had to be [...] "true" [...] only in a [...] "humanist way". [...] "A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth is something he is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it," [...] he wrote.

2500|$|Richard Eaton {{states that}} {{the origin of the}} caste system of modern form in the Bengal region of India may be {{traceable}} to the period of 1200-1500. This is after the Turkic conquests. He states that [...] "Looking at Bengal's Hindu society as a whole, {{it seems likely that the}} caste system - <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> ancient and unchanging essence of Indian civilization, as supposed by generations of Orientalists - emerged into something resembling its modern form only during the period 1200-1500". Before the Turkish conquest, the Sena dynasty kept order by distributing wealth and judging between the socially higher or lower in the context of the court and its rituals. However with the collapse of the Hindu kingship that followed the Turkic conquest, these functions appear to have been displaced onto the society, with social order being maintained through enforced group endogamy, marriage regulation enforced through caste councils and specialists kept the genealogies. The advent of Indo-Turkish rule resulted in the end with patronage for the Brahmins who had enjoyed it under the Sena government and many of them fled into the eastern hinterlands. Until 1415, they served few positions in the government and were disdained. However, this changed with Raja Ganesha's revolution and under the reign of his converted son Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, resulting in many of them gaining employment in the government by the time of Alauddin Husain Shah.|$|E
