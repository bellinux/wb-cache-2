5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

25|$|Paget was {{regarded}} {{with the utmost}} distrust and suspicion by Walsingham, who, in a despatch sent to Stafford on 16 December 1584, wrote that: Charles Paget <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> dangerous instrument, and I wish, for Northumberland's sake, {{he had never been}} born.|$|E

25|$|Salvian (or Salvianus) was a Christian {{writer of}} the 5th century in Gaul (modern France). His birthplace is uncertain, but some {{scholars}} have suggested Cologne or Trier This whole letter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> curious illustration of Salvian's reproach against his age that the noblest man at once forfeited all esteem if he became a monk.|$|E

25|$|In the 6th century, {{when the}} Irish missionary Columba first sailed to Iona, he first {{arrived at the}} island of Hinba, which he later treated to {{as a place of}} contemplative retreat. The {{extensive}} early Christian sculptures and structures on Canna, and its traditional association with Iona, have made many consider it to be the otherwise unidentified Hinba. However, Adomnán (the chronicler of the life of Columba) noted that Brendan the Navigator stopped at Hinba while traveling from Ireland to Iona; Canna <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> unlikely landfall on such a journey as it is well beyond the destination.|$|E
25|$|Melton's Waterfield Leisure Pools offer a {{range of}} activities, {{including}} a well-equipped gym and fitness suite as well as swimming. The library in Wilton Road {{is close to the}} town centre and adjacent is Melton Theatre, part of Brooksby Melton College, on the junction with Asfordby Road. The theatre first opened in 1976, has recently been refurbished and continues to provide a wide variety of entertainment. In the past few years, it has produced remarkable ballet, opera, and dramatic plays of many types, and provided a venue for many top class bands and acts, pantomime and art displays. It has ample parking, is fully licensed and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> pleasant place to visit.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Times Literary Supplement commented, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> informative, candid and {{valuable}} book". Writing in Quill, {{published by the}} Society of Professional Journalists, Robert Vaughn Young commented, [...] "Perhaps {{because this is a}} sociological study of Scientology, this is a cold, calm, academic dissection of the subject and Hubbard." [...] The California Court of Appeal cited the book as a reference in a decision relating to a criminal defendant {{who was a member of}} Scientology. When Wallis died in 1990, his obituary in The Independent noted that The Road to Total Freedom [...] "still stands as a classic of good field research".|$|E

500|$|Memling {{left out}} the rays of light, as did Dieric Bouts in his Getty Annunciation, yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a fenestra incarnationis, {{which would have been}} an {{adequate}} symbol for the contemporary viewer. By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light. Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> [...] "decorous sign of Mary's chastity", according to Blum. There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, Grove {{retired from}} the Royal College of Music. Parry was chosen to succeed him, and {{although}} Stanford wholeheartedly congratulated his friend on his appointment, their relations soon deteriorated. Stanford {{was known as a}} hot-tempered and quarrelsome man. Grove had written of a board meeting at the Royal College [...] "where somehow the spirit of the d----l himself had been working in Stanford all the time – as it sometimes does, making him so nasty and quarrelsome and contradictious as no one but he can be! He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> remarkably clever and able fellow, full of resource and power – no doubt of that – but one has to purchase it often at a very dear price." [...] Parry suffered worse at Stanford's hands with frequent rows, deeply upsetting to the highly strung Parry. Some of their rows were caused by Stanford's reluctance to accept the authority of his old friend and protégé, but on other occasions Parry seriously provoked Stanford, notably in 1895 when he reduced the funding for Stanford's orchestral classes.|$|E
500|$|Raymond Mortimer, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, said that [...] "James Bond is what every man {{would like to}} be, and what every woman would like between her sheets"; {{meanwhile}} the critic for The Times considered that after The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "On Her Majesty's Secret Service constitutes a substantial, if not quite a complete, recovery." [...] In {{the view of the}} reviewer, it was enough of a recovery for them to point out that [...] "it is time, perhaps, to forget the much exaggerated things which have been said about sex, sadism and snobbery, and return to the simple, indisputable fact that Mr. Fleming <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> compelling story-teller." [...] Marghanita Laski, writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that [...] "the new James Bond we've been meeting of late [...] somehow gentler, more sentimental, less dirty." [...] However, she considered that [...] "it really is time to stop treating Ian Fleming as a Significant Portent, and to accept him as a good, if rather vulgar thriller-writer, well suited to his times and to us his readers." ...|$|E

500|$|The Great Escape, which Albarn {{told the}} public was the last {{instalment}} in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews. The NME hailed it as [...] "spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational", while Mojo argued [...] "Blur are the very best that '95 Britpop has to offer and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> gong-worthy sound, complete with head-slicing guitars, catchy tunes and very funny words". Entering the UK charts at number one, the album sold {{nearly half a million}} copies in its first month of sale. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (which went quadruple platinum in America), the media quipped [...] " [...] wound up winning the battle but losing the war." [...] Blur became perceived as an [...] "inauthentic middle class pop band" [...] in comparison to the [...] "working class heroes" [...] Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel [...] "stupid and confused". Alex James later summarised, [...] "After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly." ...|$|E
500|$|In early April 1900, a {{movement}} among prominent West Virginia Democratic Party members in Charleston began to coalesce around Flournoy {{in support of}} his candidacy for West Virginia governor. Flournoy was considered a William Jennings Bryan Democrat with conservative positions, and Charleston Democrats felt he would receive wide support and would not antagonize corporations. Flournoy took the matter under advisement and on April 25, 1900, he announced his candidacy for West Virginia governor. In his announcement, Flournoy stated that he was unwilling to engage in a heated contest for the nomination and that he would be content with the outcome of the Democratic Party state convention, no matter the decision. He further stated that he trusted the state convention would craft a ticket that would command the support of the people of West Virginia. Following his announcement, the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper in Charles Town stated of Flournoy on May 1, 1900: [...] "Mr. Flournoy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> estimable gentleman, well and favorably known here, would doubtless make an excellent governor, and as the nominee of the Democratic party would receive a hearty support in the Eastern panhandle." [...] Flournoy also received the support of the Democratic Party in Mineral County in May 1900.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Don was {{generally}} well received by critics. Mayank Shekhar from Mumbai Mirror gave the film {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "The former was a character-driven, intimate film, albeit a fairly slick thriller, mostly for its screenplay. The latter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> updated Indian film of the action genre that always calculably concentrates on the new twists, and the turning points, both of which mostly seem cleverer than contrived; ably fitting pieces, the known characters, into a new domino." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a mixed review, saying that the film was [...] "conventional and predictable", and complained that the director did not develop his characters. However, Sen was impressed by Chopra's performance, calling it [...] "film's biggest surprise", and wrote, [...] "Stepping into Zeenat Aman's shoes is a tough task, but she doesn't really waste time pretending to be the stunner's successor. Chopra handles her role with efficiency, looking every bit the competent woman of actionand a ravishing babe who fills out a skintight white jumpsuit deliciously. Roma is a hard part to play, but Priyanka has a no-nonsense air about her throughout the film. This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic. Not to mention a great smile." ...|$|E
