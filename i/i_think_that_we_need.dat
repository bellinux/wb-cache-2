The synagogue was vandalized {{three times in a}} ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L’Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, [...] "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed." ...|$|E

However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> hardly try so far to the north, to begin with; I should say that the area of our search need go no farther north than Downham, and that between a line running west from that place and the river the child is most likely to be hidden." ...|$|E

"I {{am ready}} and willing to learn all the exercises, Scopus--I should like to excel in them all--but you might put me up as a wrestler and boxer; then if Nero insisted on my betaking myself to other weapons, I could do so without {{discredit}} to you. But my opinion is that every man should do what he can do best. Were we to fight with clubs, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> have no fear of any antagonists; but our strength is for the most part thrown away at sword play, at which any active man with but half our strength is our match. You have told me that Nero often looks in at your school, and doubtless he will do so when he comes back from Greece. You could then tell him that you had found that all the Britons were likely to excel rather in wrestling and boxing, where their strength and height came into play, than in the other exercises, and that you therefore were instructing them chiefly in them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Hicks, {{a reader}} {{in health and}} social care at the University of Salford {{questions}} the value of trying to establish that lesbian or gay parents are defective or suitable. He argues such positions are flawed because they are informed by ideologies that either oppose or support such families. In Hicks' view: Instead of asking whether gay parenting is bad for kids, I think we should ask how contemporary discourses of sexuality maintain the very idea that lesbian and gay families are essentially different and, indeed, deficient. But, in order to ask this, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> {{a wider range of}} research into lesbian and gay parenting... More work of this sort will help us to ask more complex questions about forms of parenting that continue to offer some novel and challenging approaches to family life.|$|E

When asked about how his Senate candidacy impacts his Attorney General campaign, he said, [...] "I will not be running for the Senate once I win this election in 2014," [...] but, when asked about whether he would run for the Senate if he loses, noted, [...] "I have not made a decision about that, but I fully expect to win in 2014." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper will}} relate principally to the TLRP Programme Objective of {{assisting}} teachers to transform {{their knowledge of}} learning and learners into more effective teaching practices. It will draw upon the findings of two Oxford Brookes ' research projects to present a broad brush stroke image of what learners regard as effective teaching in English 16 - 19 education. It will then consider some {{of the implications of}} these findings; and attempt to situate this discussion of learning and teaching issues into a wider philosophical debate. First, however, I should like to briefly consider the nature of language use in education. In {{the best of all possible}} worlds educational researchers would be able to conduct such complex, longitudinal studies, taking account of all philosophical, social, political, economic, and pedagogical factors, that the nature of learning and teaching would be laid bare and education enabled to become a perfect experience, fitting the needs of individuals to those of society. We all know, however, that research will never be like that. At best, research is a mapping exercise, and some maps are more accurate and therefore more useful than others. Anyone who has been left confused by an Ordnance Survey map knows that even the best maps are not always accurate and that map readers may be incompetent. Furthermore, human beings, as distinct from terrain, metamorphose more quickly and less predictably. Extending the mapping metaphor, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> some triangulation points to orientate our research into learning and teaching and how knowledge of one may inform the other. For me, those key points are: * The nature of the relationship between learners and teachers * The meaning of learner autonomy, linked to that of 'lifelong learning' * The practice of democracy in Western Europe These points are linked by a fundamental human attribute- language use.
