We investigate whether prosthesis type (intramedullary or extramedullary application) can improve early <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> in hospital patients with hip arthroplasty. Early postoperative <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> of 30 patients with TPP were compared with 31 patients treated by ISP. Each group received same rehabilitation programmes: TPP patients with early full weight bearing and ISP patients with early full weight bearing. Patients were evaluated postoperatively (on the second, sixth and discharge days). Their <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> were assessed with Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (ILAS), walking speed with Iowa Ambulation Velocity Scale (IAVS), hip functions with Harris Hip Scoring System, and hip motions with goniometer. TPP patients achieved higher scores for total <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> on the second and sixth postoperative days and during discharge than did ISP patients (p< 0. 05). Comparison of the walking speed of the patients on the second and sixth postoperative days and during discharge showed that TPP patients walked faster than did ISP patients (p< 0. 05). TPP patients had higher Harris hip scores and a higher hip motion degree than did ISP patients during discharge (p< 0. 05).

MethodsThis study was a cross-sectional study recruiting healthy individuals aged 40 – 89 years. The muscle strength of bilateral hip flexors, knee extensors, and ankle plantar flexors were measured. <b>Activities</b> including <b>functional</b> reach test, timed up and go test, and alternating stair stepping were also measured. ResultsA total of 373 male and 371 female individuals participated in this study. The muscle strength of hip flexors and knee extensors were all significantly decreased after age 80 years as compared with the age group of 40 – 49 years in both male and female groups. The abilities of functional reach and timed up and go task were significantly decreased after age 70 years in the male group and decreased after age 60 years in the female group as compared with the age group of 40 – 49 years. ConclusionWe noted that the muscle strength and <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> were decreased earlier in female than male individuals. The decrease of <b>functional</b> <b>activities</b> during the aging process seems to be earlier than the decrease of muscle strength.

Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors.

25|$|Any kind {{of animal}} that often visits or {{encounters}} flowers {{is likely to}} be a pollen vector to some extent. For example, a crab spider that stops at one flower for a time and then moves on, might carry pollen incidentally, but most pollen vectors of significant interest are those that routinely visit the flowers for some <b>functional</b> <b>activity.</b> They might feed on pollen, or plant organs, or on plant secretions such as nectar, and carry out acts of pollination on the way. Many plants bear flowers that favour certain types of pollinator over all others. This need not always be an effective strategy, because some flowers that are of such a shape that they favor pollinators that pass by their anthers and stigmata on the way to the nectar, may get robbed by ants that are small enough to bypass the normal channels, or by short-tongued bees that bite through the bases of deep corolla tubes to extract nectar at the end opposite to the anthers and stigma. Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness. Other flowers will attract pollinators by odor. For example, bee species such as Euglossa cordata are attracted to orchids this way, and it has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to the orchid flowers, which last up to 90 minutes. However, in general, plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured, but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated. They also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short.|$|E

60|$|Increased use adds to {{the size}} of muscles, {{together}} with the blood-vessels, nerves, ligaments, the crests of bone and the whole bones, to which they are attached. Increased <b>functional</b> <b>activity</b> increases the size of various glands, and strengthens the sense-organs. Increased and intermittent pressure thickens the epidermis.

Animals which during many generations have taken but little exercise, have their lungs reduced in size, and as a consequence the bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become modified.

60|$|If, after contemplating these analogies of structure, we inquire {{whether there}} are any such analogies between the {{processes}} of organic change, the answer is--yes. The causes which lead to increase of bulk {{in any part of}} the body-politic, are of like nature with those which lead to increase of bulk in any part of an individual body. In both cases the antecedent is greater <b>functional</b> <b>activity</b> consequent on greater demand. Each limb, viscus, gland, or other member of an animal, is developed by exercise--by actively discharging the duties which the body at large requires of it; and similarly, any class of labourers or artisans, any manufacturing centre, or any official agency, begins to enlarge when the community devolves on it more work. In each case, too, growth has its conditions and its limits. That any organ in a living being may grow by exercise, there needs a due supply of blood. All action implies waste; blood brings the materials for repair; and before there can be growth, the quantity of blood supplied must be more than is requisite for repair. In a society it is the same. If to some district which elaborates for the community particular commodities--say the woollens of Yorkshire--there comes an augmented demand; and if, in fulfilment of this demand, a certain expenditure and wear of the manufacturing organization are incurred; and if, in payment for the extra quantity of woollens sent away, there comes back only such quantity of commodities as replaces the expenditure, and makes good the waste of life and machinery; there can clearly be no growth. That there may be growth, the commodities obtained in return must be more than sufficient for these ends; and just in proportion as the surplus is great will the growth be rapid. Whence it is manifest that what in commercial affairs we call profit, answers to the excess of nutrition over waste in a living body. Moreover, in both cases when the <b>functional</b> <b>activity</b> is high and the nutrition defective, there results not growth but decay. If in an animal, any organ is worked so hard that the channels which bring blood cannot furnish enough for repair, the organ dwindles: atrophy is set up. And if in the body-politic, some part has been stimulated into great productivity, and cannot afterwards get paid for all its produce, certain of its members become bankrupt, and it decreases in size.|$|E
6000|$|Cause of the {{secretion}} of tears.--It is {{an important}} fact which {{must be considered in}} any theory of the secretion of tears from the mind being affected, that whenever the muscles round the eyes are strongly and involuntarily contracted in order to compress the blood-vessels and thus to protect the eyes, tears are secreted, often in sufficient abundance to roll down the cheeks. This occurs under the most opposite emotions, and under no emotion at all. The sole exception, and this is only a partial one, to the existence of a relation between the involuntary and strong contraction of these muscles and the secretion of tears is that of young infants, who, whilst screaming violently with their eyelids firmly closed, do not commonly weep until they have attained the age of from two to three or four months. Their eyes, however, become suffused with tears at a much earlier age.
