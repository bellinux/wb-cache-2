40|$|Proposals for Intervention Values for {{soil and}} {{groundwater}} have been derived {{for the fourth}} series of compounds. This fourth series consists of the following 15 additional compounds and compound groups: 1) metals: um, selenium, tellurium, thallium, tin; 2) aromatic hydrocarbons: monochloroanilines to pentachloroanilines, 4 -chloro-methylphenol; 3) chlorinated hydrocarbons: 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, <b>dichloropropanes,</b> 1, 1 -dichloroethene; 4) pesticides: MCPA and 5) other contaminants: tribromomethane, isopropanol, ethylacetate, 1, 2 -butylacetate. Intervention Values were derived by integrating the ecotoxicological and human-toxicological serious soil contamination concentration (ECOTOX SCC and HUM-TOX SCC, respectively). The HUM-TOX SCC is subject of this report and was derived using the CSOIL exposure model, the standard potential exposure data set, selected contaminant specific physicochemical input parameters and the Maximal Permissable Risk levels for human intake (MPRhuman). In general, the proposals for Intervention Values for groundwater {{and to a lesser}} extent the Intervention Values for soil are characterised by a limited accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{suspected}} carcinogen 1, 2 -dichloroethane (1, 2 -DCA) is {{the most}} abundant chlorinated C 2 groundwater pollutant on earth. However, a reductive in situ detoxification technology for this compound does not exist. Although anaerobic dehalorespiring bacteria are known to catalyze several dechlorination steps in the reductive-degradation pathway of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes, no appropriate isolates that selectively and metabolically convert them into completely dechlorinated end products in defined growth media have been reported. Here {{we report on the}} isolation of Desulfitobacterium dichloroeliminans strain DCA 1, a nutritionally defined anaerobic dehalorespiring bacterium that selectively converts 1, 2 -dichloroethane and all possible vicinal <b>dichloropropanes</b> and -butanes into completely dechlorinated end products. Menaquinone was identified as an essential cofactor for growth of strain DCA 1 in pure culture. Strain DCA 1 converts chiral chlorosubstrates, revealing the presence of a stereoselective dehalogenase that exclusively catalyzes an energy-conserving anti mechanistic dichloroelimination. Unlike any known dehalorespiring isolate, strain DCA 1 does not carry out reductive hydrogenolysis reactions but rather exclusively dichloroeliminates its substrates. This unique dehalorespiratory biochemistry has shown promising application possibilities for bioremediation purposes and fine-chemical synthesis...|$|R

So it is great significance to study the development of wall material under high temperature {{for the safety of}} flammable liquids tank farm. Taking 1, 2 - <b>dichloropropane</b> storage tank for example, based on the methods of heat transfer and {{numerical simulation}}, the mathematical model for thermal response of wall material 16 MnR steel is builded to analyse the mechanical response of 16 MnR steel under pool fire. When a pool fire of single tank took place in tank farm, the 1, 2 -dichloropropane was heated and gasitied that cause pressurizing, while the mechanical property of 16 MnR steel weakened.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Lipases form Candida rugosa and Candida antarctica were tested for their appli-cation in the enzymatic kinetic resolution of (R,S) -flurbiprofen by enantioselective esterifica-tion. Successful chromatographic separation with well-resolved peaks of (R) - and (S) -flurbiprofen and their esters was achieved in one run on chiral stationary phases by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC). In this study screening of enzymes was per-formed, and Novozym 435 was selected as an optimal catalyst for obtaining products with high enantiopurity. Additionally, the influence of organic solvents (dichloromethane, dichloroethane, <b>dichloropropane,</b> and methyl tert-butyl ether), primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol), reaction time, and temperature on the enantiomeric ratio and conversion was tested. The high values of enantiomeric ratio (E {{in the range of}} 51. 3 – 90. 5) of the esterification of (R,S) -flurbiprofen were obtained for all tested alcohols using Novozym 435, which have a great significance in the field of biotechnological synthesis of drugs. The optimal temperature range for the performed reactions was from 37 to 45 °C. As a result of the optimization, (R) -flurbiprofen methyl ester was obtained with a high optical purity, eep= 96. 3 %, after 96 h o...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that OH radical and Cl atom reactions are important removal mechanisms for water insoluble volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) in the troposphere. To determine the tropospheric fate of a haloalkane and hence the possible significance in stratospheric ozone depletion, we must first determine the rate of reaction of this species with both OH radicals and Cl atoms and thus the efficiency with which it {{is removed from the}} troposphere. To establish the ultimate atmospheric fate of one such haloalkane, halothane (CF 3 CHClBr), a widely used anaesthetic, tropospheric and stratospheric photooxidation reaction mechanisms were investigated for this species using two well established initiation steps. Results indicated that halothane will yield CF 3 CClBr radicals in the troposphere via hydroxyl radical attack: CF 3 CHClBr + OH* - CF 3 CClBr# + H 20 and CF 3 CHCI radicals in the stratosphere via photolysis: CF 3 CHClBr + hv - CF 3 CHC 1 * + Br* (X < 290 nm) under simulated atmospheric conditions. The stratospheric reaction mechanisms ultimately {{led to the formation of}} CF 3 COCl found to be a primary product, and CF 2 O and CO 2 both secondary products, from the oxidation of CF 3 CHC 1 radicals. A study of the quantum yields of formation of these species would confirm this result. Studies of the chlorine-sensitised photooxidation of halothane showed that the two major products were CF 3 CCl 2 Br and (CF 3 CClBr) 2, confirming that chlorine atom attack on halothane yielded CF 3 CClBr radicals. The effect of varying the [Cl 2]/[CF 3 CHClBr] ratio on the ratio of product concentrations showed that at all times, both products were formed, although the relative amounts of the two products varied. Further work initiated bv this study would allow us to assess quantitativelv the oxidation of CF 3 CHC 1 and CF 3 CClBr radicals. The kinetic data reported in this work is among the first dealing with the reaction of Cl atoms with a series of brominated and chlorinated alkanes. Their atmospheric lifetimes were established, with respect to reaction with Cl atoms using a relative rate smog chamber technique. The chlorine atoms were produced by the photolysis of chlorine gas We report the first measurements of rate constants for the reactions of the chlorine atom with 2 -chloropropane, 1, 3 <b>dichloropropane</b> 2 -chloro 2 methylpropane, bromoethane, 1 -bromopropane, 2 -bromopropane, 1 -bromobutane, 1 - bromopentane and 1 -bromohexane excepting K(Cl+l-chloropropane) previously reported Cl atom reactions were measured at 298 K and using a value of 2 0 x 1 0 ^ cm* 3 for [Cl], the lifetimes of the haloalkanes were calculated The atmospheric lifetimes with respect to Cl atoms are long, 1. 3 <b>dichloropropane</b> has the longest tropospheric lifetime of the compounds studied (1 5 years) and sufficiently long tropospheric lifetimes will allow transportation of these species to the stratosphere where they may release their chlorine atoms, ultimately resulting in ozone depletion...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater in the Netherlands {{has been}} {{investigated}} for residues of pesticides. Aim {{of this investigation was}} to get more information about the threat to groundwater quality as a consequence of application of pesticides, in order to consider possible measures for protection of groundwater quality in the future. A total of 59 groundwater samples have been taken in regions where pesticides are applied and where the soil is relatively vulnerable for leaching of pesticide residues to groundwater. In contract for two provinces (Zuid-Holland and Noord- Brabant) some extra samples have been taken. Most of the samples have been taken from a depth of 5 or 10 m below soil surface. From the results can be concluded that in 36 cases groundwater contained residues of pesticides at concentrations higher than the EC-guideline for drinking water, where a maximum concentration of 0. 1 mug/l is mentioned for one pesticide and 0. 5 mug/l for the total of several compounds. In 42 samples residues of pesticides have been found. In groundwater below potato cultured land residues of 1, 2 -dichloropropane, 1, 2, 3 -trichloropropane, MITC and aldicarbsulfon have been found. Below maize cultured land residues of atrazine, bentazone and metolachlor were present. In flower bulb culture ETU, 1, 2 - <b>dichloropropane,</b> 1, 3 -dichloropropane, aldicarbsulfon and chloroallylalcohol have been found in the groundwater samples; all the samples contained at least one pesticide. Furthermore residues of gamma-HCH, bromacil, metalaxyl and mecoprop have been found in one or more samples. As a consequence of these results monitoring of some selected pesticides in selected areas is suggested. Further investigation for the presence of residues of 1, 2 -dichloropropane is recommended in order to judge the extent of threat to quality of deeper groundwater and possible threats for drinking water supply. ...|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{objectives}} of the Mars Science Laboratory rover and the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite {{is to determine the}} inventory of organic and inorganic volatiles in the atmosphere and surface regolith and rocks to help assess the habitability potential of Gale Crater. The SAM instrument on the Curiosity rover can detect volatile organic compounds thermally evolved from solid samples using a combination of evolved gas analysis (EGA) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) (Mahaffy et al. 2012). The first solid samples analyzed by SAM, a scoop of windblown dust and sand at Rocknest, revealed several chloromethanes and a C 4 -chlorinated hydrocarbon derived primarily from reactions between a martian oxychlorine phase (e. g. perchlorate) and terrestrial carbon from N-methyl-N-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl) - trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) vapor present in the SAM instrument background (Glavin et al. 2013). After the analyses at Rocknest, Curiosity traveled to Yellowknife Bay and drilled two separate holes in a fluvio-lacustrine sediment (the Sheepbed unit) designated John Klein and Cumberland. Analyses of the drilled materials by both SAM and the CheMin X-Ray Diffraction instrument revealed a mudstone consisting of ~ 20 wt% smectite clays (Ming et al. 2013; Vaniman et al. 2013), which on Earth are known to aid the concentration and preservation of organic matter. Oxychlorine compounds were also detected in the Sheepbed mudstone during pyrolysis; however, in contrast to Rocknest, much higher levels of chloromethanes were released from the Sheepbed materials, suggesting an additional, possibly martian source of organic carbon (Ming et al. 2013). In addition, elevated abundances of chlorobenzene and a more diverse suite of chlorinated alkanes including <b>dichloropropane</b> and dichlorobutane detected in Cumberland compared to Rocknest suggest that martian or meteoritic organic carbon sources may be preserved in the mudstone (Freissinet et al. 2013). Chloromethane and dichloromethane were also identified after thermal volatilization of the surface soils by the GCMS instruments at the Viking landing sites, although no other chlorinated hydrocarbons were reported (Biemann et al. 1977). Here we focus on the origin of the chlorinated hydrocarbons detected in the Sheepbed mudstone by SAM and the implications for the preservation of organic matter in near-surface materials on Mars...|$|E
