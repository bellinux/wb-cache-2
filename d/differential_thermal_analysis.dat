50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis</b> (or DTA) is a thermoanalytic technique. Similar to {{differential}} scanning calorimetry. In DTA, {{the material}} under study and an inert reference {{are made to}} undergo identical thermal cycles, while recording any temperature difference between sample and reference. This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample.|$|E

5000|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} (MCC) is pure partially depolymerized cellulose synthesized from α-cellulose precursor. [...] The MCC can be synthesized {{by different}} {{processes such as}} reactive extrusion, enzyme mediated, steam explosion and acid hydrolysis. The later process can be done using mineral acids such as H2SO4, HCl and HBr as well as ionic liquids.

The MCC particles with size lower than 5 µm must not be more than 10%. The MCC is a valuable additive in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. Different properties of MCC are measured to qualify its suitability to such utilization, namely particle size, density, compressibility index, angle of repose, powder porosity, hydration swelling capacity, moisture sorption capacity, moisture content, crystallinity index, crystallite size and mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength.
