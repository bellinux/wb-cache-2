25|$|September 2: Ernest Miller, 22. Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer {{encountered}} {{outside a}} bookstore. According to Dahmer, {{he was especially}} attracted to Miller's physique. He was killed by having his carotid artery severed before being dismembered in the bathtub, with Dahmer storing his entire skeleton in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet and his heart, biceps, and portions of his legs in the <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> later consumption.|$|E
25|$|It {{will also}} contain three racks {{dedicated}} to science, FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) {{and the first}} Materials Science Research Rack (MSRR-1) {{to be placed in}} Destiny and MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory <b>Freezer</b> <b>for</b> ISS) to be placed in Kibo. The FIR will enable detailed study of how liquids behave in microgravity, a crucial detail for many chemical reactions. One experiment, for instance, will examine how mixtures known as colloids behave without being stirred by sedimentation and convection. Another using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will examine how an ideal heat pipe works without the distortions of gravity.|$|E

25|$|In March 2002, {{more than}} nine years after the murders, Anne Lockett came forward and implicated her former boyfriend, James Degorski, and his associate, Juan Luna, in the crime. Luna was a former {{employee}} of the restaurant. In April 2002, the Palatine Police Department matched a DNA sample from Luna {{to a sample of}} saliva from a piece of partially eaten chicken found in the garbage during the crime scene investigation. The chicken was kept in a <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> most of the time since the crime; testimony at trial indicated it was not frozen for several days after discovery, and was allowed to thaw several times for examination and testing, in the hope of an eventual match via increasingly sophisticated testing methods not available in 1993.|$|E
25|$|STS-126 {{included}} the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) on its fifth spaceflight. Leonardo held over 14,000 pounds of supplies and equipment.

2500|$|In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old {{acquaintance}} named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, {{rather than}} immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed {{the skeleton of}} Smith in his <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton would be acidified several months later. The skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode. (Dahmer himself was to later inform police he had felt [...] "rotten" [...] about Smith's murder {{as he had been}} unable to retain any parts of his body.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{methods are}} used for killing {{lobsters}}. [...] The most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water, sometimes after having been placed in a <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> a period of time. [...] Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in half lengthwise. Lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (pithing), {{in the belief that}} this will stop suffering. However, a lobster's brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death. The boiling method is illegal in some places, such as in Reggio Emilia, Italy, where offenders face fines up to €495. Lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking, with one device, the CrustaStun, applying a 110-volt, 2 to 5 amp electrical charge to the animal.|$|E
