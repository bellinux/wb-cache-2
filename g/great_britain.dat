5|$|Representative peers were {{introduced}} in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently {{the election of a}} small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland in January 1801.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of England—which after 1535 {{included}} Wales—ceased being {{a separate}} sovereign state on 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union {{put into effect}} the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> In 1801, <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Scotland {{emerged as}} an {{independent}} sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain.</b> The union also created a new Parliament of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain,</b> which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of <b>Great</b> <b>Britain</b> and Ireland.|$|E
