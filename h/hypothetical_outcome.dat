40|$|Abstract The use of {{supplemental}} oxygen by emergency nurses {{has important implications}} for patient outcomes, yet there is significant variability in oxygen administration practises.

A pre-test/post-test, quasi-experimental design was used. The intervention was a written, self-directed learning package. The major effects of the completion of the learning package included no change in the number or types of parameters used by nurses to assess oxygenation, a significant decrease in the selection of simple masks, {{a significant increase in the}} selection of air entrainment masks, fewer <b>hypothetical</b> <b>outcomes</b> of unresolved respiratory distress and more <b>hypothetical</b> <b>outcomes</b> of decreased respiratory distress.

The paper begins with an introduction to measures of causal effects within the potential-outcomes framework, focusing on underlying conceptual models, definitions and drawbacks of special relevance to policy formulation based on epidemiologic data. It is argued that, for policy purposes, one should analyze intervention effects within a multivariate-outcome framework to capture the impact of major sources of morbidity and mortality. This framework can clarify what is captured and missed by summary measures of population health, and shows that the concept of summary measure can and should be extended to multidimensional indices. </p...|$|E

For these purposes, the remedy of damages is normally intended to compensate for the claimant's loss of expectation (alternative rationales include restitution and reliance). The general rule is that while a loss of chance is compensable when the chance was something promised on a contract it is not generally so in the law of tort, where most cases thus far have been concerned with medical negligence in the public health system.|$|R

Bayesian analysis is a quantitative procedure in which the alternative <b>hypothetical</b> <b>outcomes</b> are postulated and their prior probabilities estimate.

40|$|We report {{two studies}} on the {{perceived}} responsibility of opponents competing for a goal that can be attained by only one of them.

There was also an effect of focal player, as Carlsen was given more responsibility both for losses and wins than Anand, by the present (Norwegian) pro-Carlsen samples.

40|$|What {{conception}} of causation {{is at work}} in the law? I argue that the law implicitly relies on a contrastive conception. In a liability case where the defendant’s breach of duty must be shown to have caused the plaintiff’s damages, {{it is not enough to}} consider what would have happened if the cause had not occurred—the law instructs us to look to a specific replacement for the cause, which in this case is the hypothetical scenario in which the defendant acted lawfully. And it is not enough to ask if the effect would still have occurred—the law requires us to look to a specific replacement for the effect, which in this case is the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>outcome</b> in which the plaintiff came off better. In place of “but for the defendant’s breach, the plaintiff’s damage would not have occurred, ” I suggest the more explicit “if the defendant had acted lawfully, the plaintiff would have met a better fate. ” An explicitly contrastive approach can thus potentially help the lawyer phrase her causal question in a more explicit way, while shedding light on our {{conception of}} causation.

40|$|Abstract. The modern Theory of the Firm {{uses the}} concept of rent and makes {{implicit}} assumptions about equilibrium. An Austrian (Market Process) Theory of the Firm should {{have something to say}} about each of these. Two strategic perspectives are analyzed, the neoclassical microeconomic perspective (using the Ricardo-Marshall approach to rent) and the Market Process perspective (using the Fetter approach to rent). In a neoclassical world, rents indicate “unsolved ” or unexploited “inefficiencies ” as every <b>hypothetical</b> <b>outcome</b> is viewed against the standard of perfect competition. By contrast, in the Market Process world there is no single ideal standard by which to measure any particular outcome. All action takes place in an open ended universe in which the future is continually being created, in which competition is a “discovery process. ” JEL classification: L 1.

Results from both studies supported the hypothesis. The findings are discussed with regard to their implications for a formal model of the outcome-satisfaction relationship and for a dynamic analysis of human behavior. The present research investigates the relation(s) between the desired outcome of an event and the satisfaction of the person who experiences the event.
