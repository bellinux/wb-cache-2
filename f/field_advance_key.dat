40|$|Transport {{planning}} {{is now a}} core subject in most undergraduate and postgraduate urban planning degrees in Asia and Australasia. But there is little guidance on what should be taught to urban planning students, or how learning is best achieved. This paper reports on research into best practice approaches, using a review of past research, a scoping of courses at Tongji University, China and at the University of Queensland and Griffith University in Australia, and the experiences of lecturers in these planning schools. Learning objectives for the <b>field</b> are <b>advanced.</b> <b>Key</b> concepts for transport and land use planning curricula are identified. Issues include better integrating planning theory, teaching a select set of key concepts, and imparting practical transport data skills. Innovative fieldwork exercises and assessment are introduced. Current guidance from education authorities and accreditation agencies in China and Australia {{are at odds with}} best practice, suggesting a need for reform.
