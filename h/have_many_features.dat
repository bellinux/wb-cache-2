5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of mitochondria: endosymbiotic and autogenous. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria were originally prokaryotic cells, capable of implementing oxidative mechanisms that were not possible for eukaryotic cells; they became endosymbionts living inside the eukaryote. In the autogenous hypothesis, mitochondria were born by splitting off a portion of DNA from the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell at the time of divergence with the prokaryotes; this DNA portion would have been enclosed by membranes, which could not be crossed by proteins. Since mitochondria <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> in common with bacteria, the endosymbiotic hypothesis is more widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|The valleys {{typically}} <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> that on Earth {{are commonly}} (though not exclusively) associated with groundwater sapping - for instance, amphitheater-like headwalls, constant valley width downstream, flat or U-shaped floors and steep walls. However, without some recharge {{mechanism for the}} putative aquifers producing this seepage, i.e., a hydrologic cycle of some kind, it is extremely unlikely that enough water could seep to cut all of the valleys formed in the Noachian. In spite of this, this basic model may remain useful in understanding the more limited valleys formed later in the Hesperian and Amazonian.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the artwork of the Gundestrup cauldron, provide {{comparative}} analyses of Celtic and Thracian traditions. Images on the cauldron <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> that are common to the Celtic and Thracian corpus of art while exotic animal motifs suggest an oriental influence. Although the design has features of Celtic belief and iconography, {{it appears to have}} been made by Thracian smiths in Dacia or Thrace, in the lower Danube region, according to their own traditions. The cauldron may have been commissioned by a member of Celtic community.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{contracts}} {{of insurance}} <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> {{in common with}} wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party {{has an interest in}} the [...] "bet-upon" [...] outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a [...] "bet" [...] with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather insurance — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial aspects of the [...] "bet" [...] (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered aleatory contracts under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.|$|E

6000|$|... § 3. The {{two methods}} {{which we have}} now stated <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> of resemblance, {{but there are also}} many distinctions between them. Both are methods of elimination. This term (employed in the theory of {{equations}} to denote the process by which one after another of the elements of a question is excluded, and the solution made to depend on the relation between the remaining elements only) is well suited to express the operation, analogous to this, which has been understood since the time of Bacon to be the foundation of experimental inquiry: namely, the successive exclusion of the various circumstances which are found to accompany a phenomenon in a given instance, in order to ascertain what are those among them which can be absent consistently with the existence of the phenomenon. The Method of Agreement stands on the ground that whatever can be eliminated, is not connected with the phenomenon by any law. The Method of Difference has for its foundation, that whatever can not be eliminated, is connected with the phenomenon by a law.|$|E
6000|$|Those kinds {{which include}} no other subdivisions than the sexes, or various breeds, are called, in {{technical}} language, species. The English lobster is a species, our cray fish is another, our prawn is another. In other countries, however, there are lobsters, cray fish, and prawns, very like ours, and yet presenting sufficient differences to deserve distinction. Naturalists, therefore, express this resemblance and this diversity by grouping them as distinct {{species of the}} same [...] "genus." [...] But the lobster and the cray fish, though belonging to distinct genera, <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>features</b> in common, and hence are grouped together in an assemblage which is called a family. More distant resemblances connect the lobster with the prawn and the crab, which are expressed by putting all these into the same order. Again, more remote, but still very definite, resemblances unite the lobster with the woodlouse, the king crab, the water flea, and the barnacle, and separate them from all other animals; whence they collectively constitute the larger group, or class, Crustacea. But the Crustacea exhibit many peculiar features in common with insects, spiders, and centipedes, so that these are grouped into the still larger assemblage or [...] "province" [...] Articulata; and, finally, the relations which these have to worms and other lower animals, are expressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into the sub-kingdom of Annulosa.|$|E
