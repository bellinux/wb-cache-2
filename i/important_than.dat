5|$|At the 1921 {{rally at}} the site, {{following}} a campaign by poet-politician Ventura Gassol, Pi Jove was inaugurated as {{the successor to}} the then-dead main tree. Speaking at the event, Gassol invited the landowner, who was present, to donate the tree to the Commonwealth of Catalonia (a semi-recognised autonomous government), but he declined, saying that practical effort is more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) {{is short}} {{compared to the}} physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E

Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time.

5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> a decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E

The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less <b>important</b> <b>than</b> barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, was a {{group of}} eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, a suburb of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E

5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less <b>important</b> <b>than</b> with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore less <b>important</b> <b>than</b> {{the risk of having}} an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some cases, such as the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> the competitive.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} {{set his sights}} on {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing {{of at least one}} million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital {{would have been}} viewed {{as an act of}} capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more <b>important</b> <b>than</b> preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
