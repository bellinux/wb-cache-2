40|$|Within massive {{structures}} hydration {{reactions of}} the cement present in the mixture promote an internal heat release. Due to the low thermal conductivity of concrete, the dissipation rate of this thermal energy {{is lower than the}} rate of production of hydration heat, so considerable temperature gradients occur. Therefore, thermal stresses arise as a consequence of differential thermal expansions or contractions. These self-induced stresses may be even higher in the scenario of additional external restraints (such as support conditions). If not adequately controlled, the self-induced tensile stresses may induce cracking of concrete at early ages. This paper <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of the concrete surrounding the spiral case of a hydroelectric turbine constructed in Brazil, with a comprehensive approach that includes: laboratory characterization of the concrete properties, numerical analyses to predict the temperature and stress fields, and the corresponding in-field monitoring. The consistency obtained between numerical results and in situ observations is discussed in detail. The thermally induced cracking risk is also evaluated.

The nucleotide evolution of gag and env-V 3 of the three strains followed a similar pattern: a very low substitution rate in the first 2 - 3 years of infection, with an increase in synonymous substitutions thereafter. Convergent evolution at the protein level was rare: only a single amino acid in a gag p 24 epitope showed convergence in the subtype B strains. Reversal of CTL-epitope mutations were also rare, and did not converge. Recombinant viruses were observed between the two subtype B strains. Luciferase-assays suggested that the CRF 01 _AE long terminal repeat (LTR) constituted the strongest promoter, but this was not reflected in the plasma viral load. Specific real-time PCR assays based upon the env gene showed that strain B 2 and CRF 01 _AE RNA was present in equal amounts, while levels of strain B 1 were 100 -fold lower. All three strains were detected in seminal plasma, suggesting that simultaneous transmission is possibl...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production of solid recovered fuel (SRF) from municipal solid waste using mechanical biological treatment (MBT) plants. It <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> first <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of a UK MBT plant and addresses the fundamental research question: are MBT plants and their unit operations optimised to produce high quality SRF in the UK? A critical review of the process science and engineering of MBT provides timely insights into the quality management and standardisation of SRF use in Europe. Quantitative fuel property data for European SRFs are collated and analysed statistically in a detailed examination of the fuel quality achievable from MBT-derived SRF. The experimental research herein applies statistical sampling, analytical characterisation and materials flow analysis to a new generation, fully operational SRF-producing MBT plant. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of this kind for a UK plant. Individual process flows from mechanically processed waste are characterised using a series of fuel properties in line with the European product standards for SRF, and confidence limits in these properties quantified. New data on SRF quality, including biogenic content, is provided. In seeking understand the variability in waste heterogeneity and its impact on SRF production in an MBT plant, material flow analysis is applied across the MBT flowsheet to compute transfer coefficients for individual unit operations. This provides a basis for critically evaluating the performance of this specific MBT {{and the extent to which}} is it optimised for SRF production. Cont/d...|$|R

METHODS: T-cell responses against HHV- 8 lytic and latent antigens were analyzed by ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot) and HHV- 8 viral load was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in sequential peripheral blood samples from a 55 -year-old woman who developed skin/mucosal and visceral KS, while receiving treatment with cyclosporine, methotrexate, and methylprednisolone for undifferentiated arthritis. RESULTS: KS may result from HHV- 8 infection in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for rheumatic diseases {{and this is the}} first case of IKS occurring in undifferentiated arthritis. A role for immune surveillance in the pathogenesis of IKS is supported by the observation of disease regression following discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. In a 4 -year follow-up, we showed that variations of the virus-specific immune responses but not of the viral load correlated well with the disease course, characterized by 2 remission and subsequent relapse phases, following changes of immunosuppressive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided evidence of a clear-cut correlation between changes in immunologic markers of HHV- 8 infection and the disease course of this viral associated tumor, concomitant with variations of immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, ex vivo enzyme-linked immunospot for HHV- 8 -specific T-cell responses represents a new tool for the clinical management of rheumatic patients with IKS...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{potential}} for infectious agents harbored by other species to become emerging human pathogens, {{little is known about}} why some agents establish successful cross-species transmission, while others do not. The simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), certain variants of which gave rise to the human HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 epidemics, have demonstrated tremendous success in infecting new host species, both simian and human. SIVsm from sooty mangabeys appears to have infected humans on several occasions, and was readily transmitted to nonnatural Asian macaque species, providing animal models of AIDS. Here we <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> first <b>in-depth</b> <b>analysis</b> of <b>the</b> tremendous SIVsm quasispecies sequence variation harbored by individual sooty mangabeys, and how this diverse quasispecies adapts to two different host species—new nonnatural rhesus macaque hosts and natural sooty mangabey hosts. Viral adaptation to rhesus macaques was associated with the immediate amplification of a phylogenetically related subset of envelope (env) variants. These variants contained a shorter variable region 1 loop and lacked two specific glycosylation sites, which may be selected for during acute infection. In contrast, transfer of SIVsm to its natural host did not subject the quasispecies to any significant selective pressures or bottleneck. After 100 d postinfection, variants more closely representative of the source inoculum reemerged in the macaques. This study describes an approach for elucidating how pathogens adapt to new host species, and highlights the particular importance of SIVsm env diversity in enabling cross-species transmission. The replicative advantage of a subset of SIVsm variants in macaques may b...|$|R
