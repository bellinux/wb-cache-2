The method mainly consists of two steps, one, evaluation of vibration induced stresses for the given central patch <b>impulse</b> <b>loading</b> using modal analysis, and two, fatigue analysis using S-N curve approach, residual strength approach as well as failure function approach. The stress state in the plate was evaluated using viscous damping model {{as a function of}} time. The stress-time history was converted into block loading consisting of many sub-blocks. In the present study, the block loading consisted of four sub-blocks and a total of 175 numbers of cycles. The block loading was repeated after every 5 s. Next, fatigue analysis was carried out based on the block loading condition evaluated. Number of loading blocks for fatigue failure initiation and the location of failure were obtained.

This paper divides dynamic <b>impulse</b> <b>loads</b> into engineering loads and blasting loads and then employs numerical calculation software FLAC 3 D to analyze the stability of an anchoring system perturbed by an <b>impulse</b> <b>load.</b> The evolution of the dynamic response of the axial force/shear stress in the anchoring system is thus obtained. It is revealed that the corners and middle of the anchoring system are strongly affected by the dynamic load, and the dynamic response of shear stress is distinctly stronger {{than that of the}} axial force in the anchoring system. Additionally, the perturbation of the <b>impulse</b> <b>load</b> reduces stress in the anchored rock mass and induces repeated tension and loosening of the rods in the anchoring system, thus reducing the stability of the anchoring system.

40|$|Success of {{electrohydraulic}} forming (EHF) process {{depends on}} coincidence of the needed pressure field {{with the field}} generated by discharge chamber at sequent stages of sheet blank deformation. <b>Impulse</b> <b>loading</b> at high-voltage discharge has a very complicated character and involves many phenomena: direct shock waves, hydraulic flows, quasi-static pressure of gas bubble, reflected shock waves, cavitation, secondary shock waves, etc. Also internal shapes of a discharge chamber, design and location of electrodes have a great influence on pressure distribution along blank surface. Because of these features, the simulation of EHF processes is very complicated task to be solved for chambers equipped with single electrode pair. And difficulties are increased greatly for simulation of multi-electrode discharge blocks (MDB). First of all, reliable data on pressure distribution at various discharge conditions are necessary to reveal and describe influence of each factor of <b>impulse</b> <b>loading.</b> Multi-point membrane pressure gauges (MPG) give an opportunity to obtain pressure maps with high resolution at relatively low cost. By design MPG typically consists of body plate with large number of small holes and sensitive element - metallic membrane. Deformation of membrane in each point (hole) can be measured and recalculated into pressure. Totality of many pressure points allows plotting a pressure map. MPGs are better suitable for measurement of shock-waves pressure. For this purpose the holes diameter and membrane thickness should be specified {{in such a manner}} that membrane is sensitive only to shock waves. Combination of MPG measurements with piezoelectric sensors can give full information about pressure map changing in time. These data could be a good basis for simulation of <b>impulse</b> <b>loading</b> with approximation formulas and also {{could be used as a}} check data for the simulation programs based on theoretical relationships. Initially the method based on MPG application was designed for investigations and improvements of discharge chambers with various forms of internal (reflecting) surfaces, electrodes position and their shapes, influence of design features on pressure distribution.
