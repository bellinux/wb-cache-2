Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb zircon analyses yielded consistent age 252. 5 ± 1. 0 Ma for one sample of the felsic rocks. The <b>granodiorites</b> were characterized by variational and high ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i, ranging from 0. 7223 to 0. 7236 and very low εNd (t) values from – 29. 1 to – 30. 4. In addition, these rocks are characterized by slight Eu negative anomalies, Nb, Ta, Ti and Sr negative anomalies on primitive mantle normalization spider. Geochemical and isotopic characteristics suggest that these rocks were derived from an enriched crust source. The <b>granodiorites</b> resulted from the fractionation of potassium feldspar, plagioclase and ilmenite or rutile. However, the <b>granodiorites</b> were unaffected by visible crustal contamination during ascent. As a result, the <b>granodiorites</b> may have been formed due to partial melting of crust-derived sedimentary rocks beneath southeastern Yunnan province, southern China...|$|R

40|$|Structural, mineralogical and {{chemical}} {{studies show that}} the rocks from the Dabakala area, previously reported as gneisses and migmatites, are in fact syntectonic granitoid bodies. Three chemical associations are distinguished: (i) trondhjemitic (Dabakala tonalites and <b>granodiorites),</b> calc-alkaline (Finéssigué <b>granodiorites</b> and undifferentiated biotite <b>granodiorites</b> and granites) and peraluminous (Sarala hololeucocratic granites and Kowara muscovite trondhjemites). Most granitoids display deformation patterns typical of an interference between pluton emplacement and transpressional tectonics induced by a NNW-SSE to NW-SE compression which led to three major NS sinistral shear zones (N'Zi, Katidougou, Ouango-Fitini). Geochronological data (U–Pb ID-TIMS and SIMS zircon ages) yielded 2312 ± 17 Ma for the zircon cores from the Dabakala tonalite, 2154 ± 1 Ma for the zircon rims of the same tonalite, 2162 ± 32 Ma for Sarala, 2118 ± 2 Ma for Kowara, and 2103 ± 1 Ma for Finéssigué.

40|$|Near Mesoraca (southern Sila, Calabria) a ductile {{shear zone}} transects syn-tectonic Late Hercynian granitoids and wall rocks. Granitoids are chiefly {{represented}} by foliated <b>granodiorites</b> and, {{to a minor}} extent, by foliated tonalites. Wall rocks are mainly represented by migmatitic paragneisses, which underwent peak metamorphism at 300 - 304 Ma. In {{the core of the}} shear zone mylonitic <b>granodiorites</b> show a clear grain size reduction and microstructures related to deformation at medium- to high-temperature conditions. Migmatitic paragneisses, foliated and mylonitic <b>granodiorites</b> mostly show concordant fabric elements. In addition, the preferred orientation of euhedral feldspars in granitoids indicates that fabric anisotropy started to develop in the magmatic state. These features strongly suggest that shear deformation was active during granitoids emplacement and protracted in subsolidus conditions. In mylonitic <b>granodiorites,</b> kinematic indicators and quartz axis analyses coherently suggest a top-to-W sense of shear, in the present geographic coordinates. Geobarometry indicates that deformation took place at middle crustal levels (P = 445 ± 138 MPa). Overprinting and crosscutting relations allowed to bracket timing of deformation. This outlasted peak metamorphism in wall rocks and was active during emplacement of the granitoids. On the other hand, late pegmatitic dykes were unaffected by significant deformation. Muscovite in pegmatite, dated by Rb-Sr method, provided an age of 265 ± 3 Ma. Therefore, shear deformation took place between 304 and 265 Ma...|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene.

Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and <b>granodiorite</b> intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E

40|$|The Torrabaai-Koigabmond Complex (southern Kaoko Belt, Namibia) {{consists}} of three main intrusive rock types including metaluminous hornblende- and titanite-bearing quartz diorites, metaluminous hornblende- and biotite-bearing <b>granodiorites</b> and peraluminous garnet- and muscovite-bearing leucogranites. Uranium-Pb zircon data obtained on the <b>granodiorites</b> and leucogranites indicate concordia upper intercept ages of 553 +/- 40 Ma although Pb- 207 /Pb- 206 ages of ca. 650 Ma in zircon from the <b>granodiorites</b> suggest some inheritance of older material. Uranium-Pb monazite data obtained on the leucogranites give concordant ages of 550 Ma +/- 3 Ma. These ages {{are similar to the}} Rb- 87 /Sr- 86 whole rock age of 584 +/- 35 Ma obtained on the <b>granodiorites</b> and leucogranites although the Rb-Sr age seems to be biased towards older ages due to limited assimilation of older material. In contrast to other plutonic complexes from the Kaoko Belt, the quartz diorites, <b>granodiorites</b> and granites show a restricted range in their initial Nd, Sr and O isotope compositions (quartz diorites: epsilon(Nd) ((init.)) : - 5. 4 to - 6. 7; delta O- 18 : 8. 3 - 9. 4 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7081 - 0. 7098; granodiorites: epsilon(Nd) ((init.)) : - 6. 1 to - 7. 7; delta O- 18 : 9. 9 - 10. 9 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7071 - 0. 7105; leucogranites: epsilon(Nd) ((init)) : - 4. 9 to - 8. 7; delta O- 18 : 9. 8 - 11. 3 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7060 - 0. 7125). Enclaves are found in the <b>granodiorites</b> and leucogranites but not in the quartz diorites. They have a granodioritic composition with quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar and hornblende and some have additional garnet. Relative to the country rock gneisses (the so called Nk Formation), enclaves are depleted in SiO 2, Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba and enriched in CaO, FeO(total), MgO, TiO 2, Sc, V, Cr, Ni, Rb and Y. Rare garnet-bearing enclaves are additionally depleted in LREE and enriched in HREE relative to the <b>granodiorites.</b> These features are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that these enclaves may represent moderately depleted melting residues of Nk Formation gneisses. In comparison with experimentally derived melts and based on low Al 2 O 3 / (FeO + MgO + TiO 2) ratios and high Al 2 O 3 + FeO + MgO + TiO 2 values it is suggested that the quartz diorites are generated by dehydration melting of a mafic, amphibole- and plagioclase-bearing lower crustal source of Pan-African age. The <b>granodiorites</b> likely represent fractionation products of the quartz diorites. However, {{it is also possible that}} the <b>granodiorites</b> represent partial melting products of a mafic to intermediate lower crustal source but experienced likely slightly lower degrees of melting probably at water present conditions. The leucogranites display higher Al 2 O 3 / (FeO + MgO + TiO 2) ratios but lower Al 2 O 3 + FeO + MgO + TiO 2 values and are most likely generated by biotite dehydration melting of felsic crustal sources. Major and trace element and isotope variations indicate that fractional crystallization with only limited crustal contamination was the major rock-forming mechanism. it is suggested that most of the isotope variation reflects pre-existing heterogeneities of the sources. Consequently, interpretation of geochemicaland isotope data from the complex suggests that the Pan-African igneous activity in this part of the Damara-Kaoko Belt was not a major crust-forming episode and all rock types represent reprocessed crustal material.

5|$|The stone, {{carved in}} black <b>granodiorite</b> during the Hellenistic period, is {{believed}} to have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at nearby Sais.

It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic language. Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars. Meanwhile, British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801, and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria and was transported to London.

5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, <b>granodiorite,</b> and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

These <b>granodiorites</b> (SiO 2 = 70. 5 %- 73. 5 %) are peraluminous, relatively depleted in Rb, U, Th, and Pb, and display a large variation in many geochemical and isotopic parameters. REE show fractionated, cross-cutting chondrite-normalized patterns with small but significant negative Eu anomalies. Initial (290 Ma) Sr and Nd, and present-day Pb isotope ratios are: (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86) 290 = 0. 7105 - 0. 7110; (Nd- 143 /Nd- 144) 290 = 0. 51 175 - 0. 51221; Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 = 18. 35 - 18. 50; Pb- 207 /Pb- 204 = 15. 64 - 15. 76; Pb- 208 /Pb- 204 = 38. 51 - 39. 03. Pb isotope ratios determined for separated feldspars show similar Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 and Pb- 208 /Pb- 204 and higher Pb- 207 /Pb- 204 ratios compared to the present-day values for the whole rock. The tonalites (SiO 2 = 57. 6 %- 67. 3 %) are typically calc-alkaline in composition {{and most of them are}} weakly peraluminous. They display large heterogeneities in trace-element abundances, REE patterns and Nd and Pb isotope ratios. both between and within individual intrusive units. Sr. Nd and Pb isotopic compositions display a range of values close to that of the associated <b>granodiorites</b> (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86) 290 = 0. 7099 - 0. 7111; (Nd- 143 /Nd- 144) 290 = 0. 51185 - 0. 51224; Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 = 18. 31 - 18. 56; Pb- 207 /Pb- 204 = 15. 65 - 15. 72, Pb- 208 /Pb- 204 = 38. 41 - 39. 59. The obtained data indicate that the tonalites and <b>granodiorites</b> share many compositional features which point to a genetic linkage. Likewise, many petrological, geochemical and field data exclude the possibility that all the <b>granodiorites</b> derive from intermediate magmas by any common evolutionary process, such as crystal-liquid fractionation or assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC), and point to a different genesis for the two rock types. An origin of the <b>granodiorites</b> by the mixing of two separate acidic melts, one of crustal anatectic origin and one probably derived from an intermediate magma by crystal/liquid fractionation or AFC, is suggested by the data presented. The tonalites appear to have been generated by interaction of a mafic magma with crustal end-member(s) with isotopic and geochemical signatures similar to those of the <b>granodiorites.</b> The large involvement of crustal material in the genesis of the Capo Vaticano granitoids is responsible for the many common compositional characteristics observed in the intermediate and acidic rocks. However, a contribution from mantle components is also indicated by petrological and geochemical data, as well as by the occurrence of mafic enclaves commonly present in the tonalites. Nevertheless, the geochemical and isotopic features of such a mantle component appear to be greatly diluted by a large quantity of crustal material involved in the genesis of the studied granitoids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The KaramadazÝ Granitoid (YahyalÝ-Kayseri) is {{a typical}} example of bimodal {{magmatism}} on the northern margin of the Eastern Tauride belt. The KaramadazÝ Granitoid intrudes the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic YahyalÝ metamorphic rocks and is unconformably overlain by Upper Maastrichtian clastics. It consists of granodiorite-quartz diorite as the main intrusive phase, and includes leucogranites and aplitic dykes in its marginal parts. Samples from the KaramadazÝ Granitoid are calc-alkaline and calcic in character. The <b>granodiorites</b> are mainly metaluminous, whereas leucogranites and aplites are weakly peraluminous in nature. Plots of major-element oxides against SiO 2 indicate a poor fractionation trend for the <b>granodiorites.</b> The leucogranites represent highly fractionated end-members. The KaramadazÝ Granitoid displays I-type characteristics based on geochemical and mineralogical compositions. LIL elements are enriched compared to the HFS elements and spider-diagram patterns {{are similar to those}} of upper continental crust rocks. The geochemical data also imply that the KaramadazÝ Granitoid is composed of two distinct magmas, derived from different sources that have undergone limited differentiation. Whatever the sources were, the magmas have interacted with the upper continental crust.
