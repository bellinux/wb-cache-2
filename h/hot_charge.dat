30|$|In conclusion, hot {{plasmonic}} holes {{were excited}} in Ag nanoparticles embedded into the DLC matrix. Therefore, negative photovoltaic effect was observed for DLC:Ag/p-Si heterostructures and conventional positive for DLC:Ag/n-Si ones. Some decrease of the DLC:Ag/Si heterostructures photovoltage and photocurrent with DLC:Ag film thickness {{was found in}} 10 – 150  nm range. It means that photocarriers excited in the Ag nanoparticles, which are located {{too far from the}} DLC:Ag/Si interface, are unable to reach silicon due to the recombination. The dependence of the TAS spectra of DLC:Ag films and photovoltaic properties of DLC:Ag/Si heterostructures on the excitation wavelength can be explained by trapping of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in DLC matrix. This process prevailed over plasmonic photogeneration of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers at lower excitation wavelengths, while energy of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier’s photoexcited by longer wavelength photons was lower than the energy of the trap states. Therefore, these lower energy carriers avoided trapping by DLC defects.|$|E

30|$|As it is {{well known}} to us that the solar {{spectrum}} and the bandgap energy of silicon semiconductor do not match each other, thus photons with energy lower than the bandgap could not be absorbed, while for photons with energy larger than the bandgap, the excess energy is lost by thermalization of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers [4]. Take these sources of energy loss into account for the solar spectrum; the maximum energy efficiency is 30 % only for a crystalline Si solar cell with a bandgap of 1.12 eV [3]. Considering this, if the conversion of one UV or visible photon into two NIR photons with energies about 1.12 eV is realized through QC in a silicon solar cell, the energy loss related to thermalization of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers can be reduced, and the solar cell efficiency will be enhanced greatly to satisfy the application requirement [5].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{progress}} of steel manufacturing technology, such as thin slab casting and <b>hot</b> <b>charging</b> {{has given rise}} to necessity of refinement of austenite grain size in as-cast steels. One of the benefits of such grain refinement could be the alleviation of hot cracking during steel production. In this work, improvement of hot ductility in the peritectic steel by means of deformation after solidification is studied. Tensile specimens were melted and solidified in situ and the hot ductility was examined at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100 °C, under two conditions: with and without a pre-deformation applied between 1400 - 1300 °C in during cooling. It was noticed that such pre-deformation improves the hot ductility significantly.

The essential fact of the new EAF steelmaking process was to <b>charge</b> <b>hot</b> metal in two portions or steps: firstly, 35 wt%- 40 wt% hot metal was pretreated by blowing oxygen in a specially designed reactor for decarburization and improving hot metal temperature and melting premelted slag; secondly, 30 wt% <b>hot</b> metal was <b>charged</b> into EAF with high basicity refining slags from ladle furnace (LF) -vacuum degassing furnace (VD) refining process. The results show that the <b>hot</b> metal <b>charging</b> ratio can reach to about 65 wt%- 70 wt% for the new EAF steelmaking process; meanwhile, the tap-to-tap time of a 50 1 EAF can shorten by 5 - 10 min, the electricity consumption can decrease by 35 - 50 kW-h/t, the lime consumption can reduce by 10. 5 kg/t of molten steel, and the content of harmful heavy metals in molten steel can be easily controlled to less than the upper limits of aimed steel specification or grade compared with the traditional EAF steelmaking process. In addition, the dephosphorization ability shows a slight strengthening, however, a small degree of lessening for desulphurization ability is observed for the new EAF steelmaking process, but the weakness of desulphurization ability cannot become an obstacle to its further application since a stronger desulphurization ability can be achieved during secondary refining of LF coupled with VD after EAF steelmaking process...|$|R

Direct detection of such reaction-induced hot electrons and holes is feasible using solid state barrier devices like Schottky diodes with ultrathin metal films. While exposing the diodes to reactive gases, a chemicurrent is {{observed in the}} diodes. The concept of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier detection by chemicurrent measurements and the dependence of the current strength on device properties are discussed in detail.

The current detection sensitivity is improved {{by a factor of}} 10 if the metal films are annealed to room temperature after low-temperature deposition. This annealing effect is related to a reduced scattering of hot electrons in the metal. Chemicurrents are attenuated exponentially with increasing metal film thickness. Attenuation lengths between 6 and 11 nm are observed. They are much smaller than attenuation lengths for photo- and internal photoemission currents. The results demonstrate that chemicurrents are due to <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier excitation and transport and are not attributed to surface chemiluminescence and photon reabsorption in the device...|$|E
30|$|The tendencies {{observed}} {{in this research}} {{can be explained by}} taking into account possible influence of the traps. The results reported in [49] should be mentioned as well. Negative photoconductivity was also observed for InAs nanowires [49]. Origin of the negative photoconductivity was attributed to the depletion of conduction channels by light-assisted hot-electron trapping [49]. Photoconductivity lowering was excitation wavelength dependent. Photocurrent decreased more when excitation wavelength was shorter (higher photon energy) [49]. In our case, we can suppose that at high excitation energies trapping of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in DLC matrix or at the Ag nanoparticle/DLC interface takes place. Thus, photoexcitation of the plasmonic charge carriers competes with the trapping process. It results in suppression of the bleaching in DLC:Ag transient spectra excited by higher energy photons as well as decreased photocurrent and photovoltage. Energy of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers excited by longer wavelength photons is below trap-related states. In such a case, photoexcited plasmonic charge carriers avoid trapping. It results in the increased sample’s photocurrent and photovoltage at higher excitation wavelengths. This fact correlates with the TAS measurements when in TAS spectra of DLC:Ag films excited at higher wavelengths of 627 and 736  nm strong negative signal was observed, too.|$|E
40|$|Understanding cooling of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> {{carriers}} in semiconductor {{quantum dots}} (QDs) is of fundamental interest and useful {{to enhance the}} performance of QDs in photovoltaics. We study electron and hole cooling dynamics in PbSe QDs up to high energies where carrier multiplication occurs. We characterize distinct cooling steps of hot electrons and holes and build up a broadband cooling spectrum for both charge carriers. Cooling of electrons is slower than of holes. At energies near the band gap we find cooling times between successive electronic energy levels {{in the order of}} 0. 5 ps. We argue that here the large spacing between successive electronic energy levels requires cooling to occur by energy transfer to vibrational modes of ligand molecules or phonon modes associated with the QD surface. At high excess energy the energy loss rate of electrons is 1 - 5 eV/ps and exceeds 8 eV/ps for holes. Here charge carrier cooling can be understood in terms of emission of LO phonons with a higher density-of-states in the valence band than the conduction band. The complete mapping of the broadband cooling spectrum for both charge carriers in PbSe QDs is a big step toward understanding and controlling the cooling of <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in colloidal QDs. </p...|$|E

30|$|Correlation {{between the}} optical {{absorbance}} spectra excited by different wavelength light and respective photovoltaic {{characteristics of the}} samples can be identified. Particularly, TAS spectra excited by 406 – 528  nm light are much more {{similar to the ones}} recorded for pure DLC matrix signal than to LSPR of Ag nanoparticles relaxation dynamics. Only {{in the case of the}} samples excited by 627 and 736  nm, the negative absorption signal, e.g., generation of the <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carriers can be seen. Such behavior was found despite that maximum of the plasmonic absorption peak was observed at ~ 500  nm. On the other hand, open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the samples clearly increased with the excitation wavelength. Such tendency was observed despite the decreased lifetime of the photoexcited charge carriers measured by TAS (see τ 1 in Table  1). Thus, according to Table  1, decrease of the photovoltaic parameters with the excitation wavelength should be expected, as higher photoexcited charge carrier lifetime results in the increased short circuit current. Yet, in our case, the reverse tendency is observed. It seems that at lower excitation, wavelength influence of the DLC matrix results in suppression of the surface plasmon resonance-related <b>hot</b> <b>charge</b> carrier photogeneration. Alternatively, one can suppose that insertion of Ag nanoclusters into the DLC matrix results in the rearrangement of the density of the states (DOE).

These PAH clusters are moderately charged and strongly heated in small impact parameter collisions with 22. 5 -keV He 2 + ions, after which they mostly decay in long monomer evaporation sequences with singly charged and comparatively cold monomers as dominating end products. We describe a simple cluster evaporation model and estimate the number of PAH molecules in the clusters {{that have to be}} hit by He 2 + projectiles for such complete cluster evaporations to occur.
