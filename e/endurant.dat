A quality can be defined as “any aspect of an entity (but not a part of it), which cannot exist without that entity” [72]. Spatial receptive field and temporal receptive window inhere in the observer, and are therefore physical qualities. Spatial receptive field and temporal receptive window are also examples of referential qualities, i.e., “qualities of an entity taken with reference to another entities” [73]. Both SRF and TRW are qualities of the observer taken with reference to the stimulus. Spatial resolution and temporal resolution inhere in the observation (i.e., a social object), and hence belong to DOLCE’s class abstract quality. Finally, DOLCE proposes a general distinction between agentive physical objects (i.e., <b>endurants</b> with unity to which we ascribe intentions, beliefs and desires), and non-agentive physical objects (which are <b>endurants</b> which constitute these agentive physical objects).

50|$|The {{reliance}} on cavalry {{as a means}} of warfare in general lies with the ancient inhabitants of the Central Asian steppes in early antiquity, who were one of the first peoples to domesticate the horse and pioneered the development of the chariot. Most of these nomadic tribes and wandering pastoralists circa 2000 BC were largely Bronze-Age, Iranian populations who migrated from the steppes of Central Asia into the Iranian Plateau and Greater Iran from around 1000 BC to 800 BC. Two of these tribes are attested based upon archaeological evidence: the Mitanni and the Kassites. Although evidence is scant, they are believed to have raised and bred horses for specific purposes, as is evidenced by the large archaeological record of their use of the chariot and several treatises on the training of chariot horses. The one founding prerequisite towards the development of cataphract cavalry in the Ancient Near East, apart from advanced metalworking techniques and the necessary grazing pastures for raising horses, was the evolution of selective breeding and animal husbandry. Cataphract cavalry needed immensely strong and <b>endurant</b> horses, and without selectively breeding horses for muscular strength and hardiness, they would have surely not been able to bear the immense loads of armor and a rider during the strain of battle. The Near East is generally believed to have been the focal point for where this first occurred.|$|E

In order to answer this question and see its consequences, one has to pay careful attention to the distinctions between: particulars and universals, persisting and instantaneous particulars, determinable and determinate universals. It is argued that robust top-level ontologies that classify particulars have to rely on other taxonomic principles than those who, like traditional science, classify universals. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{technical}} evolution of endografts for the interventional management of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has allowed a continuous expansion of indications. This study compares the established Talent endograft with its successor, the <b>Endurant</b> endograft, taking individual aortoiliac anatomy into account. Methods: From June 2007 to December 2010, 35 patients with AAA {{were treated with}} a Talent endograft (33 men) and 36 patients with an <b>Endurant</b> endograft (34 men). Aortoiliac anatomy was evaluated in detail using preinterventional computed tomography angiography. The 30 -day outcome of both groups were compared regarding technical and clinical success as well as complications including endoleaks. Results: The <b>Endurant</b> group included more patients with unfavorable anatomy (kinking of pelvic arteries, p = 0. 017; shorter proximal neck, p = 0. 084). Primary technical success was 91. 4 % in the Talent group and 100 % in the <b>Endurant</b> group (p = 0. 115).

MethodsAn intention-to-treat analysis was performed for all comers with AAAs who were implanted with an <b>Endurant</b> endograft between November 2007 and December 2010. Clinical and radiologic data were prospectively collected and analyzed. The primary end point was any AAA-related reintervention. Secondary end points were overall mortality, aneurysm shrinkage, all types of endoleak, and device-related complications. ResultsDuring the study period, 273 patients underwent implantation of the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft. The median follow-up time for the primary end point was 42  months (interquartile range, 30. 7 - 50. 7). AAA-related reinterventions were required in 26 patients (10 %), resulting in a reintervention-free probability of 93 %, 90 %, and 87 % at 3, 4, and 5  years, respectively. The leading cause for reintervention was iliac limb occlusion (n = 10). Only one AAA-related death (0. 3 %) was reported within an overall mortality of 29 % (n = 78).

METHODS Data from patients treated with the <b>Endurant</b> II stent-graft between December 2012 and March 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-four patients were included. Patients were assigned to group A if treated under instructions for use (n= 34, 53 %) and to group B if treated off-label (n= 30, 47 %). Outcome measures included perioperative mortality and morbidity, survival, freedom from reintervention, endoleak incidence, in-hospital length of stay, and mean stent-graft component used. Mean follow-up was 22. 61 ± 12 months (median, 21. 06 months; range, 0 – 43 months). RESULTS One perioperative mortality (1. 6 %) and one perioperative complication (1. 6 %) occurred in group B. At two months follow-up, one iliac limb occlusion (1. 6 %) occurred in group A. No type I/III endoleaks were recorded. A type II endoleak was identified in three cases (4. 7 %).

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of a challenging neck on mid-term results using the <b>Endurant</b> I stent-graft system in high risk patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on a prospectively compiled database of 72 elective patients with challenging neck treated with the <b>Endurant</b> I system (<b>Endurant</b> Stent Graft, Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). These patients were compared to a control group (65 patients) without significant neck problems. The endpoints were mid-term 2 -years technical, clinical success and the event free survival of all treated patients. Results: Mean age was 76. 12 years; 76. 6 % of patients were males. Risk factors and preoperative variables did not differ significantly between the two groups. Only 4 (5. 5 %) patients of the study group vs. 2 (3. 1 %) in the control group developed type I endoleak during the follow-up. Three (4. 1 %) study group patients developed type III endoleak vs. 2 (3. 1 %) in the control group. All these patients required an adjunct procedure of relining with a new endograft.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of stent grafting on aortoiliac tortuosity and to explore the role of the tortuosity index (TI) as a predictor of iliac limb complications after EVAR. MethodsA retrospective case-control study was performed comparing an iliac limb complication group with a control group. Reconstructed computed tomography angiography images were analyzed to calculate TI of the aortoiliac segments. ResultsThis study included 153 patients, 120 in the control groups (40 Zenith flex [Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind], 40 <b>Endurant</b> II [Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn], and 40 Excluder [W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz] stent grafts) and 33 in the complications group (13 Zenith flex, 14 <b>Endurant</b> II, 4 Excluder, and 2 Aorfix [Lombard Medical, Oxfordshire, UK] stent grafts). There was a significant reduction in aortic and iliac TI after EVAR. This was greatest with the Zenith Flex compared with <b>Endurant,</b> with the least change in TI seen after Gore Excluder implantation. Iliac limb complications included 10 type Ib endoleaks, one iliac limb modular dislocation, two limbs with insufficient engagement, four occlusions, and 16 iliac limb kinks. There was no significant difference in complication rates between the three stent grafts (Zenith flex, 1. 4 %; <b>Endurant,</b> 2. 9 %; Excluder, 1. 9 %; P =. 115). The median time to iliac complication was 14 months (range, 1 - 90 months).

40|$|BackgroundThis study {{evaluated}} {{the early and}} intermediate results of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) using the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft (Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients treated according to device-specific instructions for use (IFU) for the proximal aortic neck compared with those obtained in patients treated in an off-label (OL) situation. MethodsBetween November 2007 and March 2010, 177 consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) were treated with the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft at our centers. The IFU for the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft included a proximal neck of 15 mm in length and 80 years in the OL group (37. 5 % vs 19 %, P =. 008), and they also had larger aneurysms (59 ± 10. 6 vs 55. 9 ± 10. 8 mm, P =. 05) and required a longer procedure time (69. 3 ± 27. 2 vs 60. 8 ± 20. 4 minutes, P =. 02). At 30 days, the risk of type I endoleak was higher in the OL group (2 patients, 3. 6 % vs 0 in IFU), but this did not reach statistical significance (P =. 09). The two groups were similar in rates of perioperative mortality, major morbidity, technical success, clinical success, complications, and reinterventions. At 1 year, {{there were no differences}} between the two groups in survival, freedom from any device-related reinterventions, and freedom from graft thrombosis. Estimated 1 -year freedom from type I endoleak was 100 % in the IFU group vs 93. 3 % in the OL group (P =. 01). ConclusionsIn patients with both normal and complex anatomy of the proximal aortic neck, the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft obtained acceptable results, with no difference in survival, morbidity, or reinterventions. However, there was a greater risk of type I endoleak when OL indications were applied.

Clinical data, AAA characteristics, presence of endoleaks, graft migration, and other EVAR-related complications were noted. All values are stated as mean ± SD (range). ResultsThis study included 100 patients with AAAs (88 men) {{with a mean age}} of 73 ± 8 years (47 to 87 years), an AAA size of 61 ± 10 mm (31 to 93 mm), an AAA volume of 210 ± 122 mL (69 to 934 mL), a proximal neck length of 33 ± 14 mm (9 to 82 mm), and an infrarenal angulation of 44 ± 25 ° (0 °- 108 °). Nineteen of the 100 included patients had at least one anatomic characteristic that was considered a violation of the instructions for use (IFU) of the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft. A primary technical success was achieved in 98 % of the patients (one additional stent placement in renal artery was required; one unplanned aorto-uni-iliac device placed), with no primary type I or III endoleaks or conversions. A secondary technical success was achieved in all cases. The 30 -day mortality was 2 % and the first postoperative CTA documented 16 endoleaks (16 %; 16 type II). One-year follow-up showed three iliac limb occlusions (3 %), one infected stent graft (causing a type Ia endoleak), and five endovascular reinterventions (5 %; three to treat iliac limb occlusions, one proximal extension cuff; and one stent in the renal artery). The 1 -year all-cause mortality rate was 12 % (12 patients) and the AAA-related mortality was 3 %. The mean AAA size was significantly smaller after 1 year (diameter, 54 ± 11. 8 [32 - 80] mm; P 5 mm and 13 endoleaks were noted (12 type II, 1 type I [neck dilatation]). ConclusionThe treatment of patients with AAAs with the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft seems to be successful and durable during the first year after EVAR. Despite the wider inclusion criteria for the <b>Endurant,</b> and with 19 % of our patients treated outside the IFU, the AAA-related mortality, number of type I or III endoleaks, and reintervention rates are comparable to the results of other stent grafts...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} endovascular aneurysm repair is disputable in aneurysms with a short, angulated, wide, conical, or thrombus-lined neck making a reliable seal difficult to achieve. The influence of a challenging neck on early results using the <b>Endurant</b> stent-graft system in high risk patients was investigated. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study conducted on a prospectively compiled database of 72 elective patients with challenging neck treated with the <b>Endurant</b> system (<b>Endurant</b> Stent Graft, Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). These patients were compared to a control group (n = 65) without significant neck problems. Endpoints were early technical and clinical success, deployment accuracy and differences in operative details at one month follow-up. Data are reported as {{mean and standard deviation}} or as absolute frequency and percentage (%). Normality distribution and homogeneity of variances were tested by Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests, respectively. Inter-group comparisons for each variable were made by t-test or χ 2 -test or Fisher exact test. A p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Mean age was 76. 12 years; 76. 6 % were males. Risk factors and pre-operative variables did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mean neck length was 10. 56 mm in patients with challenging anatomies and 22. 85 mm in controls. Patients with a challenging neck differed significantly (p < 0. 001) from controls in terms of mean infrarenal (37. 67 ° vs. 20. 12 °) and suprarenal angle (19. 63 ° vs. 15. 57 °); 82 % of patients with a challenging neck were ASA III/IV (vs. 86 %). Technical success was 100 %, with four unplanned proximal extension in challenging group. No type I endoleaks or aneurysm-related deaths occurred in either group; major complications were 1. 54 % vs. 1. 39 % (p = 0. 942). Operative details were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the <b>Endurant</b> stent-graft is technically feasible and safe, yielding satisfactory results even in challenging anatomies. Medium- and long-term data are needed to verify durability, but early results are promising...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} and compared the midterm results of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with the <b>Endurant</b> (Medtronic Inc, Santa Rosa, Calif) stent graft system in off-label use {{in patients with}} short (< 10  mm) proximal aortic necks and in patients treated according to device-specific instructions for use. MethodsThis was a case-control (2 : 1) single-center retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data performed between September 2008 and December 2012. Analysis identified 19 elective patients with short (< 10  mm) proximal necks and mild angulations (≤ 45 °) treated with the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft and 38 patients matched for age, sex, and aneurysm diameter with proximal aortic necks ≥ 10  mm in length who met the instructions for use. End points included technical and clinical success and freedom from any secondary intervention, any type of endoleak, and aneurysm-related death. ResultsThe short-neck group was a mean ± standard deviation age of 71. 7  ± 8. 9  years, 84 % were men, and their mean infrarenal aortic neck length was 6. 1  ± 1. 2  mm. Mean suprarenal and infrarenal angles were 110 ° ± 10. 4 ° and 170 ° ± 15. 4 °, respectively. Aortic neck diameters were similar between the groups (26. 6  ± 3. 8 vs 25. 7  ± 3. 7  mm; P =. 36). Primary technical success was achieved in all cases. Off-label patients {{were more likely to}} require additional proximal cuff deployment to successfully obtain a seal (21 % vs 3 %; P =. 04). The two patient groups were similar in rates of perioperative mortality, morbidity, and complications. Mean follow-up of 24  ± 12  months revealed no differences in clinical success, freedom from reintervention, and aneurysm-related death. No type I endoleaks were observed in either group during the follow-up period. ConclusionsThe <b>Endurant</b> stent graft system applied off-label in patients with very short aneurysm necks (< 10  mm) with mild angulation showed acceptable treatment results. These midterm results might suggest its use in carefully selected patients with very short neck anatomy. Long-term data are needed to verify the observed durability of the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe ENGAGE {{registry}} {{was undertaken}} {{to examine the}} real-world outcome after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR) with the <b>Endurant</b> Stent Graft in a large, contemporary, global series of patients. MethodsFrom March 2009 to April 2011, 1262 AAA patients (89. 6 % men; mean age 73. 1 years, range 43 – 93 years) were enrolled from 79 sites in 30 countries and treated with <b>Endurant.</b> Results are described following the reporting standards for EVAR. Follow-up data were tabulated for all 1262 patients at a 30 -day follow-up {{and for the first}} 500 patients at a 1 -year follow-up. ResultsIntra-operative technical success was achieved in 99. 0 % of cases. Within 30 days, adverse events were reported in 3. 9 % of patients, including a 1. 3 % mortality rate. Type-I or –III endoleaks were identified in 1. 5 % of cases. Estimated overall survival, aneurysm-related survival and freedom from secondary interventions at 1 year were 91. 6 %, 98. 6 % and 95. 1 %, respectively. At 1 year, aneurysm size increased ≥ 5  mm in 2. 8 % and decreased ≥ 5  mm in 41. 3 % of cases. ConclusionEarly results from this real world, global experience are promising and indicate that endovascular AAA repair with the <b>Endurant</b> Stent Graft is safe and effective across different geographies and standards of practice. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to assess durability of these results...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} 30 -day {{outcome and}} quality of life after elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in octogenarians. MethodsFrom March 2009 to May 2011, 1200 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft were included in the <b>Endurant</b> Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Postmarket Registry (ENGAGE) registry. Among these, 926 (77 %) were aged 99 % for both cohorts. Octogenarians were more often operated on under general anesthesia (P =. 028), had a longer procedure duration (P =. 001), and an increased length of hospitalization; both total (P <. 001) and postprocedure (P <. 001). All-cause mortality and major adverse event rates were similar in the two groups (P =. 835 and P =. 186, respectively). There was no difference in the number of secondary endovascular procedures or aneurysm rupture at 30 days. At discharge, both groups had reduced health status dimensions, except anxiety/depression, when compared with baseline. At 30 days, the octogenarian group had a lower composite EuroQoL 5 -Dimensions Questionnaire index compared with the younger group, indicating a slower recovery (0. 83 ± 0. 20 vs 0. 87 ± 0. 16; P =. 003). ConclusionsOctogenarians can be safely treated using the <b>Endurant</b> stent graft with a high technical rate of success, low perioperative mortality, and no reduction in quality of life. Octogenarians did, however, appear to recover more slowly than younger patients with respect to certain quality of life components. Long-term data are needed to confirm these results...|$|E
