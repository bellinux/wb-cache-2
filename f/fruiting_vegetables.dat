There is either positive or negative relationship present in inorganic phosphate and speciated arsenic among the vegetables. Significant negative relationship between inorganic phosphate and inorganic arsenic is observed in different types of <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables</b> e. g., bitter ground, tomato, between inorganic phosphate and DMA in bitter gourd, and between inorganic phosphate and total arsenic in bitter gourd, lady's finger, and tomato. The <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables</b> contain low level of arsenic, which might have some relationship with higher level of inorganic phosphate. In root and tuber vegetables, significant relationship was present in arum. But in case of arum loti significant positive relationship is observed between inorganic phosphate and DMA.

The aim of our {{study was to determine}} behavioral and environmental factors that influence <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy consumption among Serbian schoolchildren. MethodsWe used 24 -hour recall to measure <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy intake of schoolchildren (N = 212) aged 8 to 11 years from 2 elementary schools in a local community in Serbia. We evaluated potential determinants of intake by using a 48 -item questionnaire that asked about children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s behaviors, perceptions of others 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 expectations and behaviors, reinforcement of children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s behaviors, and availability of <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and dairy at home and school. Children completed written questionnaires during 1 school class under teacher supervision. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze determinants of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy intake. ResultsNegative predictors of fruit intake were expectations from teacher and parents (P <. 001) to eat fruit and availability of <b>fruit</b> in school. <b>Vegetable</b> intake was positively related to paternal modeling behavior (P <. 001) and availability of vegetables at home (P =. 04).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the impacts on natural enemies and competitor thrips species of insecticides used for control of western flower thrips in <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Trials with tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and with pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) were conducted to evaluate insecticide treatment effects on western flower thrips and natural enemies at the North Florida in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. A number of insecticides from different classes showed moderate to high efficacy against western flower thrips. The broad-spectrum insecticides acetamiprid, methomyl, and tolfenpyrad demonstrated activity against the pest, while also reducing populations of the key predator of thrips in pepper, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). Insecticides that showed little impact on populations of O. insidiosus were cyantraniliprole, flonicamid, spirotetramat, and terpenes. Although only moderately active against the western flower thrips, they would be valuable additions to existing management programs for pepper. Insecticides with activity against western flower thrips also showed activity against Frankliniella tritici (Fitch). This non-damaging congener species is a beneficial because it out-competes the western flower thrips, especially in tomato where O. insidiosus is not a major factor in western flower thrips management. Numerous insecticides were identified with activity against the western flower thrips that are suitable for use in integrated pest management programs of <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables...</b>|$|E

30|$|Due to {{multiple}} reasons {{relating to the}} necessity of incorporating {{a wide spectrum of}} vegetable types as well as inclusion of the entire geographical expanse of the country, replicates could not have been accommodated in this study, hence, the study being semi-quantitative in nature. The reason behind choosing five vegetables was not merely for increasing the sample diversity; rather to impart a type of diversity that would provide self-sufficiency to the assessment. As the five vegetables cover a broad spectrum of tuber, brassica, leafy, root, and <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables,</b> this enables testing samples {{from a wide variety of}} plant organs to deduce contamination scenario through the soil–water–air continuum in the biogeochemical cycle. Besides, the vegetables selected from these five categories (one vegetable from each category) are widely consumed as well as grown throughout the country. As there are particular contamination routes throughout the country with regard to Pb and Cr, therefore, it is also necessary to incorporate the entire geographical expanse of the country in order to reveal the ecotoxicological fate of recent extensive ambient atmospheric Pb pollution in the country, as well as the impact of the Cr contamination phenomenon through wide dissemination of protein-concentrates produced from chrome-tanned skin cut solid waste for farming practice. It is the inclusion of such wide spectrum of vegetable types as well as the entire expanse of the country into the research design that provides the true significance of the study. Due to these necessities, the study has been conducted in semi-quantitative nature, with an already extensive sample base.|$|E

This results in a collection of 292 samples. Due to the necessity of incorporating a wide spectrum of vegetable types (e.g. tuber, brassica, leafy, root, and <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables)</b> as well as the need for including the geographic expanse of the whole country, replicates were not accommodated in the study, hence, the study being semi-quantitative in nature.

40|$|Sustainability is {{becoming}} more and more important in the competitive battle between the greenhouse-grown <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables</b> produced in Spain and the Netherlands. A monitoring system has been developed. Sustainability is a broad concept regarding primary producers and other links in the chain. However, the greatest impact on the environment comes from the primary production. The first phase of the research is aimed at energy use and crop protection at the production level. Primary knowledge and experience of real experts of suppliers of horticultural inputs is used as a source of facts and developments. Physical production is lower in Spain and greenhouses are usually unheated. Primary fuel consumption per kg of tomatoes, sweet peppers and cucumbers is estimated to be 13, 14 - 17 and 9 times greater respectively in the Netherlands. Due to the lower prices in spring no widespread heating of greenhouses is expected in Spain in the near future. Innovation is therefore a slow process in Spanish greenhouse horticulture. It is estimated that 19, 16 and 24 times more active ingredients are applied per kg of tomatoes, sweet peppers and cucumbers respectively in Almeria than in the Netherlands. Biological disease control is common in the Netherlands and in Spain on less than 5 % of the acreage. Biological disease control is used on 60 % of acreage of sweet peppers in Murcia. This is related to the start of cultivation in winter and the low risk of virus infection by insects during that period. Heating is used on about 20 % at the acreage of this crop and is beneficial for the reduction of the use of fungicides. This combination makes the picture of sweet peppers in Murcia more rosy...|$|E
40|$|The BfR {{has been}} {{provided}} with non-representative findings from official food surveillance {{as well as from}} industry quality control activities regarding perchlorate drawing on four independent data sources. Perchlorate residues above 0. 01 milligrams per kilogram were found in 33 % of tested food samples, while residues of over 0. 05 milligrams per kilogram were also detected in 17 % of samples. The BfR has assessed the health risks resulting from these findings and discussed the possible pathways by which perchlorate enters foods. Levels were measured in one or more samples of citrus fruit, exotic fruit, root vegetables, <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetables,</b> brassica vegetables and leaf vegetables which could potentially lead to undesirable effects if large portions are consumed on a one-time basis. This concerns in particular the inhibition of iodide uptake in the thyroid gland […]. There are many possible routes via which perchlorate can enter foods. It can, for example migrate from fertilisers to plants and therefore also to plant-based foods. Migration from contaminated overhead irrigation or standard irrigation water is also possible. Perchlorate might, for example, enter the water together with industrial waste water or occur as a by-product of the chlorination of drinking water. Chlorination of drinking water and irrigation using drinking water are not customary in Germany, however. […] Against this backdrop, the BfR recommends that efforts be undertaken to reduce the entry of perchlorate into the food chain and therefore to minimise the burden for consumers. As the illegal use of perchlorate for purposes such as the disinfection of foods cannot be ruled out, this potential entry pathway should be investigated on both national and European level and, if necessary, suitable measures taken to prevent this happening. Consumers should not make any major changes to their normal diets, as the health benefits of fruit and vegetables remain undisputed...|$|E
