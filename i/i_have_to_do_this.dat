Viennese composer Ernst Krenek described meeting the writer in 1932: [...] "At {{a time when people}} were generally decrying the Japanese bombardment of Shanghai, I met Karl Kraus struggling over one of his famous comma problems. He said something like: 'I know that everything is futile when the house is burning. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> {{as long as it is}} at all possible; for if those who were supposed to look after commas had always made sure they were in the right place, Shanghai would not be burning'." ...|$|E

They'll all have to go abroad,--that'll be the end of it. There's been such a scene between the earl and George. George lost his temper and told the earl that Porlock's marriage was his fault. It has ended in George with his wife being turned out." ...|$|E

I suffer; she shall suffer more; I know you a fiend, she shall find a whole hell with you; she is purer and better than I have ever been; soon you shall make her worse than I have dreamt of being. Her purity shall be dishonoured, her love betrayed, her life reduced to such chaos that she shall cease to believe even in her God, and in return for these things I will give her--you. Your new plaything shall pass through my mill, George Caresfoot, before ever she comes to yours; and on her I will repay with interest all that I have suffered at your hands;" [...] and, exhausted with the fierceness of her own invective and the violence of conflicting passions, she sank back into her chair.|$|E

I know you are not very well pleased with me, and I don't know that I can ever put myself in a better light with you--the true light. It seems {{that there are some}} things we must not do even for the truth's sake. But that's neither here nor there. What I am most anxious for is not to take a shadow of advantage of this child's--of Imogene's inexperience, and her remoteness from her family. I feel that I must in some sort protect her from herself. Yes--that is my idea. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in so many ways that I hardly know how to begin. I should be very willing, if you thought best, to go away and stay away till she has heard from her people, and let her have that time to think it all over again. She is very young--so much younger than I! Or, if you thought it better, I would stay, and let her remain free while I held myself bound to any decision of hers. I am anxious to do what is right. At the same time"--he smiled ruefully--"there {{is such a thing as}} being so disinterested that one may seem uninterested. I may leave her so very free that she may begin to suspect that I want a little freedom myself. What shall I do? I wish to act with your approval." ...|$|E

Speaking of Roden, Quatro said: [...] "She's a sound healer and {{she asked me to}} do some workshops with her, which I did, and it was quite an interesting experience." [...] When asked if she found the exercise helpful in her own life, Quatro said: [...] "Definitely, I think that, whenever you do something like that, you realize that most people really {{have the same kind of}} problems.", adding [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> I have to give something back".

50|$|The western zone on {{the other}} hand, being {{contiguous}} to North Bengal, could not remain unaffected from the Bengali influence. For example, Bengali words such as matha (head), pakhi (birds) and Assamese words such as duar (door), chuli (hair), bihan (morning), which were used in early Assamese, are used {{by the people of}} Goalpara. There are some peculiarities in the dialect of Goalpara. For example, uyak aisa khaibe (he has to come), mok ei kamta or kajta kara khai (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> work). Again, sometimes “L” becomes “N” in western dialect, such as lage becomes nage and lal becomes nal (red), infusing another difference in the dialect. In the Goalpariya dialect, expressions such as pet peta (rotten), tiktika (deep) are very common. It is worth noting that the Maithili word angcha (garment), and Hindi words such as kawari (door) and damad (bridegroom) have directly entered into the Goalpariya dialect and are still found in the same form and carrying the same meaning.|$|E

She had [...] "creative control" [...] over J.Lo, even more than On the 6, explaining [...] "I really felt like this time it was even more mine." [...] During the album's release, Lopez began to transition into a sex symbol. Previously, she had been vocal in living her life while acknowledging her responsibility as a role model to youth. The entertainer stated, [...] "I mean, I feel like you can't take on the responsibility of the world, you know? I think it's destructive ...

5000|$|On 19 August Mecca's Angel {{attempted}} {{to become the}} first horse to win back-to-back runnings of the Nunthorpe Stakes at York since Sharpo recorded his third consecutive success in 1982 (Borderlescott had won the race in 2008 and 2009 but the first of his victories came when the race was run at Newmarket). In a nineteen-runner field she started second favourite behind Limato, a four-year-old gelding who had won the July Cup on his previous start. The other runners included Profitable, Sole Power, Goldream, Brando, Pearl Secret, Take Cover (King George Stakes) and Danzeno (Chipchase Stakes). Mecca's Angel was among the leaders from the start before taking the lead in the last quarter mile. She kept on strongly in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Limato with Take Cover another two lengths back in third. After the race Mulrennan admitted [...] "I’d love to say she’s complicated and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> and that, but I just have to point her.

40|$|That’s silly! ” “I’m bored! ” “I like that! ” “Why do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> ” “What is this for? ” These are all {{important}} responses and questions {{that come from}} children. As our design partners in developing new technologies, children can offer bluntly honest views of their world. They have their own likes, dislikes, and needs that {{are not the same}} as adults ’ (Druin, Stewart, Proft, Bederson, & Hollan, 1997). As the development of new technologies for children becomes commonplace in industry and university research labs, children’s input into the design and development process is critical. We need to establish new development methodologies that enable us to stop and listen, and learn to collaborate with children of all ages. In the chapter that follows, a discussion of new research methodologies will be presented...|$|E
3000|$|In {{discussing}} obstacles {{related to}} student participation in laboratory sciences, one HINU faculty member commented, “Based {{on my own}} observations and knowledge of many, certainly not all, but many traditions there would be issues that could very clearly preclude or pose obstacles to students wanting to participate in lab sciences.” One obstacle is objections to dissecting animals that might serve as clan totems or have significant importance in story-telling traditions as teachers. “This is {{something that would be}} taboo because of that individual’s relationship with that animal.” Even though Western scientists might note that the physical aspect of the animal is dead, and the physical aspect is all there is, for many Native people, the metaphysical aspect, the spiritual presence, of the animal is real and still very much present. “So I think there are Native people who would be very put off by that kind of activity, it could cause them tremendous stress, anxiety, because in their traditions {{this is not something that}} one would ordinarily engage in.” This faculty member shared the story of a Native American student who was attending a non-tribal college and was very enthusiastic about studying science, “but as they got into it and then began to ask if they could be excused from certain kinds of activities because of their own cultural values and traditions…at that particular school people were unwilling to be accommodating,” which caused the student to pursue another major. “They were led to believe that you can’t be a scientist unless you do these kinds of things, which I think is one of those challenges that scientists need to be very aware of…That’s one story, maybe among dozens, hundreds, where students because they were told they had to do this basically said ‘well, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> then I’m not going to be a scientist.’” [...]...|$|E
40|$|Orin Martin {{manages the}} Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz, {{where he is}} widely admired for his skills as a master orchardist, horticulturalist, and teacher. Martin grew up an {{athletic}} and outdoors-oriented child in Massachusetts, Florida, New York State, and Ohio—without any interest in gardening, which struck him as “an onerous chore, and kind of sissy stuff, actually. ” While he was in Washington, D. C. in the late 1960 s, {{as a student at}} American University, he “got politicized” by current events: some 100, 000 citizens marched on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam war; Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. In 1969, exhausted and alienated after a lonely struggle to avoid the military draft, Martin followed some friends to Santa Cruz, where he heard about “this place called ‘The Garden’”—the one being cultivated by Alan Chadwick and his protégés on the UCSC campus. “I wandered up there one morning,” said Martin in this interview, “and I was just bowled over, {{and fell in love with}} it, and felt, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this.</b> ” Martin had no training as a gardener. His unfinished undergraduate studies were in English; his interests leaned toward writing and literature. Suddenly infatuated with the Chadwick garden nonetheless, he attended public lectures given by Alan Chadwick on the campus and in town. In 1972, shortly after Chadwick had left Santa Cruz and the UCSC Farm had been launched, Martin began volunteering several days a week at the Farm and Garden. When the apprenticeship program there became formalized under Chadwick successor Stephen Kaffka, Martin applied; after completing the apprenticeship in 1975, he received a grant to start a community gardening program in various locations around Santa Cruz County. In 1977, UCSC hired Martin and a colleague named “Big” Jim Nelson (not to be confused with the Jim Nelson interviewed in this series) to oversee the Farm and Garden. More than thirty years later, countless productive garden beds, fruit trees, and former apprentices bear vital testimony to the effectiveness of Martin’s ministrations. In this interview—conducted on July 11 th and August 29 th, 2008, at UCSC’s Science and Engineering Library—Orin Martin spoke with Sarah Rabkin about his work with the Farm and Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, his cultivation of an organic rose collection and orchards of citrus and deciduous fruit tree varieties especially suited to the local climate, and his mentorship of Farm and Garden apprentices...|$|E
