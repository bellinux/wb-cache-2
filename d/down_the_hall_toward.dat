25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms {{had no way to}} know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small number of exits. As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E
60|$|Anderson {{said all}} this rapidly and low while they walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> the end room {{which had not}} been used since Mrs. Anderson's death. The door was ajar. Lenore smelled strong, pungent odors of antiseptics.|$|E
60|$|The negro waiter {{tried to}} seat him near the door, but he pushed on <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> a little group {{near one of}} the sunny windows, which he took to be the sick girl and her father, and so it proved.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{inform you}} of {{any change in}} the odds showing." [...] Reinhart strode past her, out of <b>the</b> office and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> He headed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> SRB room, an intense thalamic {{excitement}} rising up inside him.|$|R
60|$|He ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> deserted <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> red lamp {{which he}} knew {{indicated}} {{the place of}} a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it was open. In the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a pile of clothing. He ran to the window, could not get it up, but smashed it with a chair, and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape; below him was a crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed in a ruddy light. Must he go down in his spectral night dress? No--this side of the house was not yet on fire except at the further end; he would snatch on those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough, though a trifle loosely, and they were just a shade loud as to pattern. Also as to hat--which was of a new breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having been to England yet. One side of the coat went on, but the other side refused; one of its sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder. He started down without waiting to get it loose, made the trip successfully, and was promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the police.|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2014, {{members of}} the House of Commons {{protection}} services and the RCMP were instrumental in stopping an armed man who had stormed the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. Constable Son was stationed at the front entrance when he spotted the man entering with a concealed rifle. The constable lunged {{to gain control of}} the firearm, but it discharged and struck him in the leg. Drawn to the Rotunda by the noise, Corporal Malo and Constable Thom took cover and exchanged several rounds with the gunman after he entered the building. Constable Létourneau tracked <b>the</b> gunman <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Honour <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Library of Parliament and fired at him several times. RCMP Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett, Bergeron, Bubelis, Célestin, Fraser, Marcoux, Palmer, Ruest and Waye, who had assembled outside the Peace Tower, entered the Centre Block. Supported by their colleagues, Sergeant Rozon, Corporal Daigle and constables Barrett and Fraser assumed a tactical formation (IARD) as they charged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Honour. With the shooter now cornered in an alcove leading to the Library, Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, after being advised of the shooter’s location, dove to {{the floor in front of}} him and fired his weapon. RCMP Constable Barrett walked directly toward the gunman while also firing his weapon. The collective actions of these 16 individuals brought the incident to an end in less than three minutes, and avoided further tragedy.|$|R
60|$|I ventured <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> the stern, {{and found}} it opened into {{the stern of the}} Elsinore, forming a single large {{apartment}} at least thirty- five feet from side to side and fifteen to eighteen feet in depth, curved, of course, to the lines of the ship's stern. This seemed a store- room. I noted wash-tubs, bolts of canvas, many lockers, hams and bacon hanging, a step-ladder that led up through a small hatch to the poop, and, in the floor, another hatch.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned the}} lights off and passed out and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> the morning room. At the {{entrance}} she paused and listened. From farther on had come, not a noise, but an impression of movement. She could have sworn she had not heard anything, yet something had been different. The atmosphere of night quietude had been disturbed. She wondered what servant could be prowling about. Not the butler, who was notorious for retiring early save on special occasion. Nor could it be her maid, whom she had permitted to go that evening.|$|E

60|$|They ran quickly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> last {{flight of}} stairs, and across <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> servants' quarters. Their {{chattering}} was heard faintly echoing through the baize doors. Then nothing more.|$|R

40|$|As Bill Jasper {{left his}} office and walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> his classroom, he {{found it hard to}} believe that only a few months earlier he had begun {{teaching}} his first class at University College. A wistful smile played at the comers of his mouth as he thought back to that enlightening, but somewhat unsettling, experience. 2 ̆ 2 I was greener than a spring apple, 2 ̆ 2 he muttered. 2 ̆ 2 I wish I had known then what I know now. 2 ̆ 2 Reflection on the Use of 2 ̆ 2 The Return of Bill Jasper, 2 ̆ 2 by The Editor...|$|E
60|$|It {{was almost}} {{time to go}} in for the morning session when several of the cadets noticed a figure, huddled up in a slouch hat and a heavy overcoat, coming up from behind <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>toward</b> a side door.|$|R
60|$|The little {{procession}} {{made its}} way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> girl was still clinging to her uncle.|$|R
50|$|Since the altercation {{took place}} halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>the</b> {{only thing the}} {{security}} cameras at the checkpoint could have captured is McKinney walking past the metal detector and turning left <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and off <b>the</b> camera, and the subsequent pursuit by Officer McKenna. U.S. Capitol Police clarified that the altercation was not captured on security camera.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> Four In Line: Two couples join {{hands so}} that they form a line of four, and walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> or away from the music. Sometimes the {{two people in the}} center twirl those on the side, but this is optional.|$|R
60|$|Alora passed out, {{scarcely}} {{aware that}} Janet had pretended to lock <b>the</b> door. Halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>the</b> woman {{handed her the}} key.|$|R
60|$|Madame Cerise {{laid down}} her book, placed her {{pince-nez}} in the case, and slowly proceeded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> door shook with another powerful impact, a voice cried out demanding admittance.|$|R
60|$|Pothinus {{appears in}} the loggia, and comes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> very haughtily to Caesar's left hand.|$|R
60|$|He dashed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{and stood}} shyly {{scratching}} at the straw of his newest hat.|$|R
60|$|Then Eric ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and, {{putting out}} his strength, tore the Baresark from them.|$|R

60|$|The cowboy seemed {{galvanized}} into action. He leaped over Hardman's body, huddled and lax, and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> {{pulling his}} guns.|$|R
60|$|Reinhart got {{quickly to}} his feet and left the office. He hurried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and out of the Council building.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ulster <b>Hall</b> {{features}} one of {{the oldest}} examples of a functioning classic English pipe organ. The Mulholland Grand Organ is named in honour of former Mayor of Belfast, Andrew Mulholland, who donated £3000 to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>toward</b> its cost in the 1860s. It was built by William Hill & Son and donated after <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> was officially opened. In the late 1970s, the organ was extensively restored to Hill's own original design. Mullholland's great-great-grandson, Henry Mulholland, 4th Baron Dunleath, oversaw the restoration.|$|R
60|$|CAESAR (anticipating him). Yes: I know. (Rufio and Britannus come <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> from <b>the</b> loggia at {{opposite}} sides, past Caesar, who {{waits for a}} moment near the step {{to say to the}} soldier.) Comrade: give the word to turn out on the beach and stand by the boats. Get your wound attended to. Go. (The soldier hurries out. Caesar comes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> between Rufio and Britannus) Rufio: we have some ships in the west harbor. Burn them.|$|R
