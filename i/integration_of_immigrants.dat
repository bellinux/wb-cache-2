Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants,</b> exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.|$|E

40|$|European {{society has}} always been and still is diverse in many aspects, {{including}} language, ethnicity, culture, religion and economics. We may thus speak of diversity both within individual countries and among countries – and also within school classrooms. Immigrant children who enrol in the Slovenian school system come to Slovenia {{primarily because of the}} family reunion. This paper sets out four examples of good practices (two urban and two rural schools), where various support systems were developed for the successful <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children. The <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children has been a success at those schools that are familiar with the possibilities under the law and European guidelines for <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children, that seek a variety of ways to cooperate with parents, those schools where teachers take regular and additional training, develop their own intercultural competence and collaborate on a variety of projects. The results are even better if the school has support on the local level, and if intercultural competence is developed among all inhabitants...|$|R

25|$|There {{is a small}} {{community}} of Swedish-speaking immigrants in Finland. Many of them come from Sweden, or have resided there (about 8,500 Swedish citizens live in Finland and around 30,000 residents in Finland were born in Sweden), while others have opted for Swedish {{because it is the}} main language in the city in which they live, or because their partners are Swedish-speaking. About one quarter of immigrants in the Helsinki area would choose to integrate in Swedish if they had the option. According to a report by Finland's Swedish think tank, Magma, there is a widespread perception among immigrants that they are more easily integrated in the Swedish-speaking community than in the majority society. However, some immigrants also question whether they ever will be fully accepted as Finland Swedes. Swedish-speaking immigrants also have their own association, Ifisk and in the capital region there is a publicly financed project named Delaktig aimed at facilitating <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> who know or wish to learn Swedish. Most if not all immigrants also wish to be fluent in Finnish {{due to the fact that}} it is the dominant language in Finnish society.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study investigates {{economic}} <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs {{by comparing}} {{them with their}} native-born counterparts, and examines whether and how entrepreneurs’ socio-cultural integration affects their economic integration. Research Design & Methods: This study is based on data of the Social Surveys conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics in 2008, 2010 and 2012. The sample included 1133 native-born and 576 immigrant entrepreneurs. Findings: :Socio-cultural integration is not necessarily associated with economic integration and a high income. Immigrants can earn the same and even more than native-born entrepreneurs do, {{even if they have}} a low level <b>of</b> socio-cultural <b>integration.</b> The impact <b>of</b> socio-cultural <b>integration</b> on <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs’ income varies by their origin. Implications & Recommendations: Understanding <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs and the factors affecting their income will help policy-makers to facilitate their economic advancement. Contribution & Value Added: Based on Berry’s concept, I propose a model <b>of</b> entrepreneurs’ <b>integration.</b> The model stresses interrelations between socio-cultural and economic integration...|$|R

40|$|After gaining {{independence}} in 1991, Slovenia experienced {{new forms of}} immigration, a trend which was accelerated by the country's 2004 acceptance into the European Union, which made Slovenia attractive to a variety <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> groups, including families with children. However, initial integration efforts were limited, with Slovenia's relevant institutions only having made a serious effort to integrate immigrant children into Slovene society over the last decade. Through these efforts, Slovenia was fulfilling its duty as a signatory of the Convention of Children's Rights, which obliges countries to ensure that immigrant children have the same right to an education as children of Slovenian citizens and requires countries to integrate such children into their education systems. In practice however, despite this established theoretical foundation, there is a discrepancy between the needs <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children and what is being offered {{to them by the}} Slovenian education system. In particular, this research has focused on specific support programmes devised and offered by schools to facilitate the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children, including compensation, support, additional activities, and other forms of help. It also gives an overview of this issue within the Slovenian education system, including how many schools carry out specific integration programmes, what type of support each school is offering, and which factors affect the creation and implementation of such programmes. Moreover, this research also takes into account demographic factors related to each school, including its size, the number <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children at a school, the professional profile of its staff, and the socio-economic background of the surrounding area. It also follows children's experiences throughout this process, investigating how the implementation of such programmes affects the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children into both the school environment and wider society. However, {{it should be noted that}} this study does not encompass the additional Slovenian language lessons financed by the Slovenian Ministry for Education, Science and Sport to which all immigrant children are entitled in their first two years following their arrival in the country. Unfortunately, the results of this research paint a dispiriting picture of the provision <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> programmes in the Slovene education system, with the key finding being that immigrant children are not given the attention required to fully integrate them into the school environment, with the result being that the Slovenian education system fails to fully exploit immigrant children's cognitive potential. Language acquisition is a particular problem, resulting in immigrant children that not only struggle in a formal educational environment, but also face difficulties integrating socially and interacting with their peer group. Ultimately, many of the schools which took part in this research felt that they have to find their own way when it comes to the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children, and therefore offer specific programmes that help to integrate immigrant children, with staff at these schools believing that these programmes are effective and facilitate immigrant children and their parents becoming part of the school and local community, leading to immigrant children that are better socialised, have improved self-esteem and feel accepted, all traits which allow them to adapt successfully to their new environment. In order to successfully integrate immigrant children into the Slovenian education system, the state needs to adopt an active role in this process; including the creation of a well thought out integration policy, specialised training for teachers who work with immigrant children that enables them to develop the skills required, a truly multi-/intercultural curriculum and the provision of sufficient funding to effectively implement this process. It is only this systemic, wide ranging approach that will ensure all immigrant children have an equal role in all areas of society, as well as producing motivated staff that will create and carry out specific learning programmes that will enable the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> these children. With the model <b>of</b> successful <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children, we have built on the findings of the research discussed above, we want to contribute to more holistic view on the issue <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children. Moreover, applicable and orientational value of this model can be implemented in some changes <b>of</b> more efficient <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> children into Slovenian education system. The use of various research methods in this study, such as questionnaires and structured interviews, has enabled us to adopt a more comprehensive approach to analysing the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> first generation <b>immigrant</b> children into Slovenian primary schools. ...|$|R
