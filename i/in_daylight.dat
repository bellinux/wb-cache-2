5|$|Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} the probable route. He expected the Germans to make an attempt anytime after the 10 February. Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans would use the darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would leave <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b> The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally unprepared to strike <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> hours on 12 February.|$|E
5|$|British {{researchers}} {{had found that}} the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> was prohibitive; and that externally mounted light projectors (following the Canadian approach) unacceptably disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E

5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{plans were}} {{in place for the}} Allied forces {{to break out of the}} ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> meant that by the end of the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{was held}} on 13–14 June, with two two-hour {{sessions}} each night; one run at dusk, the other in darkness. New drivers were again required to run a set number of laps to learn the circuit and be allowed to race: three <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> and three at night. The best overall time from all four sessions determined the starting grid.|$|E

5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> {{with the naked eye}} under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|The first combat <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> began {{just after}} 08:00. A He 111 from Aufklärungsgruppe 51 (Long-range Reconnaissance Group 51), based near Paris, was intercepted and {{shot down over}} the Channel by Hurricanes from No. 87 Squadron RAF. A Heinkel He 59 air-sea rescue {{aircraft}} was dispatched, but found {{no trace of the}} Heinkel or its five crew.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hours later}} 156 Para had covered about , and as {{darkness}} fell {{they came up}} against a strong German defensive position which {{they were unable to}} outflank in the dark. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel des Voeux, out of contact with brigade headquarters, decided to stay where they were for the night and continue the advance <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E
50|$|On August 29, 2013, 20-year-old Dante Alexander and an {{unidentified}} individual, shot 26-year-old Brandon Nance to death <b>in</b> broad <b>daylight</b> <b>in</b> front of Italian People's Bakery.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for {{the renewed}} {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>daylighting</b> include {{the high cost}} of fossil fuels and the realization that sources of electricity have a finite life. Less tangible aspects of daylighting relate more to the human spirit and quality of life.|$|R
5000|$|A 1988 book, <b>In</b> Broad <b>Daylight,</b> by Harry N.

5|$|Unlike Gregory, Braham was unperturbed by {{the events}} of 12 May 1944. Braham {{believed}} that while the war continued a trained combat pilot must engage the enemy at all costs. His experience allowed him a greater chance to survive the odds than a new pilot but he acknowledged his fortune could not last forever. Braham continued to fly operations deep into enemy airspace over Denmark, alone, and <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E
5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b> Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|HMS Delight was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Delight was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her duty station where she remained until mid-1939. Delight was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before the Second World War began in September 1939. She served with the Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign. The ship was sunk by German dive-bombers on 29 July 1940 while attempting to transit the English Channel <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} for incorporating the non-image-forming effects of light into <b>daylighting</b> design <b>in</b> the built environment. The framework includes human performance indicators to measure {{the magnitude of the}} non-image-forming effects of light as well as light factors to quantify these effects. <b>In</b> addition, architectural (<b>daylighting)</b> design parameters are included to control the magnitude of the light factors reaching indoor environment. To assess the magnitude of the non-image-forming effects of light <b>in</b> <b>daylighting</b> design process, threshold values for every light factor are discussed. A distinction is made between luminous and temporal characteristics of every light factor and the application of their thresholds <b>in</b> <b>daylighting</b> design process. The proposed framework enables stakeholders in the field of daylighting to incorporate the non-image-forming light requirements in design and to evaluate the potential of indoor spaces with regard to these requirements...|$|R

5|$|On 7June, {{the battery}} was {{assaulted}} again by two troops of commandos from No. 3 Commando, {{part of the}} 1st Special Service Brigade. The attack <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> was repulsed with heavy losses to the commandos. As they withdrew, they were engaged by the battery's guns firing over open sights. The British never succeeded in completely destroying the battery, and it remained under German control until 17August, when the German Army started to withdraw from France.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|The 51st Transport Regiment had {{constructed}} an airstrip on Lorengau and commenced another, known as Momote Airstrip, at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau {{was used as}} a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes. By February, both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{second to}} fifth {{scenes of the}} Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime {{minister}} and baby's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga, celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls (mochi) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene as bright as <b>in</b> <b>daylight.</b> There is one illustration following this scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} hunts almost entirely at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt <b>in</b> <b>daylight</b> when it has young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up {{to the size of a}} young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake have been killed and eaten.|$|E
5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were <b>in</b> <b>daylight,</b> leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air gunner Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It {{was identified as a}} Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E
