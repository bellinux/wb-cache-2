The role {{of social support}} (SS) as a protective factor against ED among IPV-exposed women is not firmly established. Objective: The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the distribution of risk of EDs among women exposed to IPV and to examine the impact of SS on risk of ED among IPV-exposed women. Methods: Women (aged 18 – 64 years) exposed to IPV during their lifetimes (defined by the Humiliation–Afraid–Rape–Kick instrument) were recruited from primary care and domestic violence service agencies and surveyed on demographics, mood/anxiety disorders, psychosocial/community factors, and strategies used in response to IPV. The Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care assessed the risk of ED. A modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey assessed overall functional support (scale range: 0 – 32; categorized into quartiles). Ordinal logistic regression examined the risk of ED based on SS, controlling for prespecified demographics (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, near-poverty level), and health-related factors significant in bivariate analyses (risky alcohol use). Results: Among 302 women with lifetime IPV, 41 (14 %) were at high risk, 127 (42 %) were at moderate risk, and 134 (44 %) were at low risk of an ED. In bivariate analyses, high risk of an ED was significantly more frequent among women with a low SS score (< 19, 24 %) versus a <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> (≥ 30, 12 %) (P= 0. 03). High risk of an ED was significantly associated with risky alcohol use (18 %) versus non-risky alcohol use (13 %; P= 0. 008). In multivariable analysis, a 5 -unit increase in overall SS was significantly associated with decreased odds of ED risk (P= 0. 007). Conclusion: Among IPV-exposed women, low SS is associated with an increased risk of ED. SS may protect against ED by reducing anxiety and promoting positive actions, but further study is needed to confirm this.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relation between SS and plaque characteristics and poststent vascular response using optical coherence tomography in coronary artery tree and left anterior descending artery (LAD) in patients with stable angina. A total of 179 lesions among 165 patients, including 100 lesions in LAD, were analyzed. Patients were stratified into tertiles. In pre–percutaneous coronary intervention analysis of whole coronary tree and LAD, lesions of the third tertile had the highest prevalence of lipid-rich plaque. Compared with the first tertile, the third tertile had greater lipid index, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma. In poststent optical coherence tomography, the incidence of stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion was higher in the third tertile compared with the first tertile in coronary tree analysis. In LAD analysis, the prevalence of irregular protrusion was the highest in the third tertile. In conclusion, <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> may reflect <b>higher</b> plaque vulnerability. Stent edge dissection and irregular protrusion were more frequent in patients with <b>higher</b> <b>SS,</b> indicating poor vascular response to stenting.

40|$|BackgroundCurrent {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) recommend the GRACE score for risk stratification with assessment of admission variables. The syntax <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> is a comprehensive angiographic scoring system that is derived entirely from the coronary anatomy and lesion characteristics. We investigated the relationship between severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed with SYNTAX <b>Score</b> (<b>SS)</b> and GRACE <b>Score</b> (GS) in patients with AMI. Patients and MethodsFrom the obseRvatoire des Infarctus de Côte d’Or (RICO) survey, 614 consecutive patients hospitalized for an AMI from 1 st march 2011 to 30 august 2012 and who underwent coronary angiography were included. Patients were analyzed into 3 tertiles of risk based on GS. ResultsThe tertiles of risk were defined as low (n= 205) (GS 165). Age and co-morbidities increase gradually with increased GS risk. Also, the number of diseased vessels on coronary angiography increased across the tertiles (p< 0. 001). In-hospital mortality increased from the low to the highest tertile (0. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 11. 8 %, p< 0. 001). Patients at high risk had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>SS</b> values compared with the intermediate and low GS risk (median (IQR) SS: 13 (6 – 20) vs 9 (4 – 15) vs 7 (3 – 12), respectively, p< 0. 001). Moreover, SS was strongly correlated with GS (r=+ 0. 254, p< 0. 001), and remained significant in patients with multivessel disease. By logistic regression analysis, both GS and <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> are significant correlate of hospital mortality (OR(95 %CI) 1. 04 (1. 02 – 1. 05), p< 0. 001 and OR(95 %CI) 1. 11 (1. 07 – 1. 15)).

40|$|IntroductionThe syntax <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> was {{developed}} in 2005 by the team of the Rotterdam Thorax Center to characterize {{the complexity of the}} coronary network by taking into account: 1 /the number of lesions and their impact on function, 2 /the location of the lesions, and 3 /theircomplexity. However, patients in this study had multivessel disease and stable angina. In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we aim to study thecharacteristics of the SS in diabetic patients and todetermine the predictive value of the SS as compared with the GRACE score for inhospital death. Materials and methodsOur study analysed 1107 consecutive patients, including 873 non-diabetic patients and 234 diabetic patients, hospitalized for AMI in the intensive coronary care unit ofDijon from September 2011 to December 2012 and whohad undergone coronary angiography. The SYNTAX and GRACE scores were both calculated for each patient. ResultsMedian <b>SS</b> was significantly <b>higher</b> in diabetic patients (11 (4 – 15) vs. 8 (4 – 15), p< 0. 001) than in non-diabetic patients. In multivariable analysis, three predictive factors for a <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> were found: female (OR= 0. 62; 95 % CI=[0. 45 – 0. 89], (p= 0. 005)); age (OR= 1. 03; 95 % CI=[1. 02 – 1. 04], (p< 0. 001)) and HDL-C (OR= 0. 28; 95 %CI= [0. 11 – 0. 72], (p= 0. 008)). In-hospital mortality increased significantly with increasing <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> quartiles (Q 1 : 2. 9 %, Q 2 : 2. 2 %, Q 3 : 4. 0 %, and Q 4 : 9. 7 %, p< 0. 001). SSscore was associated with inhospital mortality, even after adjustment for confounding factors (GRACE scoreand left ventricular ejection fraction). ConclusionIn acute MI, the <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> is a reliable tool as it provides objective information on the coronary network and is aprognostic factor in the short term. Nonetheless, furtherstudies are needed to understand the influence of risk factors such as diabetes or hyperglycemia on the initialand residual SS, and {{to assess the impact of}} SS onpharmacological and other revascularization strategies...|$|R

30|$|Because of {{the lack}} of better {{objective}} indicators for evaluating the coronary complexities, previous studies about the correlations between risk factors such as the hypertension and the severity and complexity of coronary arterial lesions (CAL) were few. The SYNTAX <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> is a lesion-based angiographic scoring system that was developed to quantify the number, complexity, and location of lesions in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). <b>Higher</b> <b>SS</b> are related to more-complex diseases. Therefore, patients undergoing PCI with <b>high</b> <b>SSs</b> are likely to have worse prognosis. The SS is based on anatomical features of CAL and can be used to quantitatively evaluate the complexity of CAL according to anatomical features such as lesion location, severity, bifurcation, and calcification. Although its clinical applications have some limitations such as its inability to determine the characteristics of plaques and coronary flow reserve, a large number of studies have confirmed that the SS has strong clinical practicality when used as a risk assessment tool for coronary revascularization (Farooq et al. 2014; Head et al. 2014; Mohr et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} an {{angiographic}} score {{was introduced in}} clinical practice to stratified different levels of risk after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug eluting stents. The SYNTAX <b>score</b> (<b>SS)</b> classified patients in three different risk levels and was included in revascularization guidelines that patients allocated with low SS could be equally treated with either PCI or CABG, whereas those with intermediate or <b>high</b> <b>SS</b> were better off with CABG. However, using original SS each coronary lesion with a diameter stenosis ≥ 50 % in vessels ≥ 1. 5 mm was scored. In ERACI IV registry we used a revascularization strategy during PCI where operators were advised to only treat lesions≥than 70 % in a≥ 2. 0 mm reference vessel; therefore, no intermediate lesions should be treated, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm was discouraged as well. If we recalculated SS using the above-mentioned operators' advices all intermediate lesions were not scored, and severe stenosis in vessels< 2. 0 mm were excluded for the analysis, including bifurcations, trifurcations and chronic total occlusions; after this new <b>scoring,</b> the original <b>SS</b> dropped significantly which is {{in accordance with the}} goal of complete functional revascularization strategy of the ERACI IV study and the low one year adverse events of such study. In conclusion, if we performed an <b>SS</b> <b>scoring,</b> only severe stenosis in vessels with a reference diameter ≥ 2. 0 mm would allow a more rational assessment of coronary anatomy, and the use of a more conservative PCI strategy...|$|R
40|$|Postsurgical gastroparesis {{syndrome}} (PGS) is {{a complex}} disorder characterized by postprandial nausea, vomiting, and gastric atony without evidence of mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. These symptoms can be disabling and are frequently unresponsive to drug therapy. Fifteen patients with documented PGS, including 13 women and two men, were recently treated by completion gastrectomy (CG) over a 5 -year period. Gastric emptying study (GES) was markedly prolonged in 12 of the patients studied, and improved partially in only one patient (8 %) with the administration of metoclopramide alone or combined with other gastrokinetic drugs. Patients were evaluated {{both before and after}} surgery, using a modified Visick rating system and a severity of symptoms (<b>SS)</b> <b>score</b> based on seven gastrointestinal (G. I.) and five systemic variables. All 15 patients underwent CG and reconstruction with a 50 cm Roux-en-Y limb. There were no operative deaths or complications related to the esophagojejunal anastomosis. Mean postoperative follow-up was 13. 9 months, with a range of 2 - 65 months. After CG, the Visick rating and overall <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> improved significantly. The improvement in <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> was primarily due to a significant decrease in G.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} patient-reported health-related quality of life following proton therapy for prostate cancer in men 60 years old. METHODS: Between August 2006 and January 2010, 262 hormone-naive men 60 years old were treated with definitive proton therapy for prostate cancer. Before treatment and every 6 months after treatment, patients filled out the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires. Potency was defined as successful sexual intercourse in the prior month or an EPIC sexual summary (<b>SS)</b> <b>score</b> 60. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 24 months; 90 % of men completed follow-up EPIC forms within the last year. For EPIC urinary, bowel, and hormone subscales, the average decline from baseline to 2 years was 5 points, except for bowel function (5. 2 points). <b>SS</b> <b>scores</b> declined 12. 6 points after 2 years. Potency rates declined by 11 % from baseline at 2 years, but 94 % of men were potent with a baseline IIEF> 21, body mass index < 30, and no history of diabetes. At 2 years after treatment, only 1. 8 % of men required a pad for urge incontinence. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with a significant decline in <b>SS</b> <b>score</b> were mean penile bulb dose 40 cobalt Gy equivalents (P. 012) and radiation dose 80 cobalt Gy equivalents (P. 017); only diabetes {{was significantly associated with}} impotence (P. 015).

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is associated with}} risk {{of congestive heart failure}} (CHF), cognitive dysfunction and depression. CHF itself is linked both to poor cognition and depression. The ventricular N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a marker of CHF, suggesting potential as a marker for cognitive impairment and/or depression. This was tested in the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study (ET 2 DS). Cross-sectional analysis of 1066 men and women aged 60 - 75 with type 2 diabetes. Results from seven neuropsychological tests were combined in a standardised general cognitive ability factor, 'g'. A vocabulary-based test estimated pre-morbid cognitive ability. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed possible depression. After adjustment for age and sex, raised plasma NT-proBNP was weakly associated with lower 'g' and <b>higher</b> depression <b>scores</b> (<b>ß</b> - 0. 09, 95 % CI - 0. 13 to - 0. 03, p =  0. 004 and ß 0. 08, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 12, p 0. 05 for 'g'; β 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 02 to 0. 07, p> 0. 05 for depression scores).
