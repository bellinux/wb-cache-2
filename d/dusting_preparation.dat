40|$|Metarhizium anisopliae conidia were {{formulated}} {{with three}} granular carriers and nine dust diluents and stored over an 8 - to 12 -month period at 4 ° or 20 °C. The virulence of formulations, {{with the exception}} of two <b>dust</b> <b>preparations,</b> was reduced significantly compared to unformulated conidia against Culex pipiens pipiens larvae. The formulation components most detrimental to conidial virulence were corn cob granules, diatomaceous earth, and two Kaolinite diluents. This was exampled by a decline in virulence from ca. 100 % for unformulated conidia to 36 % or below for these formulations. LT 50 values also increased from 2. 4 – 2. 6 days for unformulated conidia to above 6 days. In contrast, a diluent derived from dried castor oil (Thixcin R) significantly enhanced conidial virulence at several doses above that of unformulated conidia against C. pipiens larvae. Enhancement occurred whether conidia were formulated prior to storage or stored separate from the diluent and mixed prior to application. The Thixcin R formulation was more effective against Anopheles stephensi larvae, but virulence was reduced against Aedes aegypti larvae. A bentonite formulation (Bentone- 38) also maintained conidial virulence effectively, but Thixcin R was a superior diluent. It was shown that conidial virulence of formulations was not correlated with differences in conidial viability. The preparations that were applied dry by a surface method were more virulent than when an aqueous suspension containing a surfactant was used. The results demonstrate the need to assess efficacy of mycoinsecticidal formulations in a virulence bioassay prior to field testing...|$|R

Notion of new materials as substitute for the conventional materials have supported these efforts to a large extent. In the present investigation,marble dust obtained after processing of marble waste {{has been used as}} a filler material i. e. as replacement of fine aggregate. This study investigates the optimum partial replacement of cement in concrete with marble dust in conjunction with super-plasticizers. This investigation proved the feasibility of marble dust as an economic and eco-friendly replacement of cement. The slump and compressive strength of the concrete was improved when 5 %, 10 % & 15 % of weight of cement was replaced with marble <b>dust</b> in <b>preparation</b> of M 20 concrete. This paper provides the scope for more research that if the marble dust is used as a replacement of cement in conjunction with super-plasticizers,the problem of sustainable, economical and environment friendly concrete can be resolved...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{accepted}} that fibre dimensions {{are the most important}} factor in the development of asbestos related disease with long fibres being more dangerous than short for all types of asbestos. This information has been derived from in vitro experiments and injection or implantation experiments since the kilogramme quantities of specially prepared dusts that are necessary for long term inhalation have not been available. The present study has taken advantage of the availability of a sample of amosite produced so that almost all fibres were less than 5 micron in length. The effects of this dust were compared to dust prepared from raw amosite that contained a very high proportion of long fibres. Previous data from studies with UICC amosite, which was intermediate in length, were also available for comparison. At the end of 12 months of dust inhalation, significantly more short fibre amosite was present in the lung tissue compared to the long but while the long fibre dust caused the development of widespread pulmonary fibrosis, no fibrosis at all was found in animals treated with short fibre. One third of animals treated with long fibre dust developed pulmonary tumours or mesotheliomas but no pulmonary neoplasms were found in animals treated with short fibre dust. Following intraperitoneal injection, the long fibre amosite produced mesotheliomas in 95 % of animals with a mean induction period of approximately 500 days. With short fibre dust, only a single mesothelioma developed after 837 days. In previous inhalation studies with UICC amosite, relatively little pulmonary fibrosis had developed and only two benign pulmonary tumours. This would suggest that to produce a significant carcinogenic response in rat lung tissue amosite fibres must be longer than those in the UICC preparation. Following the injection of UICC amosite, however, mesotheliomas developed in the same proportion of animals and with the same mean induction period as with long fibre dust. From this it would appear that while very short fibres exhibit little carcinogenicity to either lung or mesothelial tissues, mesotheliomas can be produced by <b>dust</b> <b>preparations</b> consisting of shorter fibres than are needed to produce tumours...|$|R

The study demonstrated that contact sensitization to mites occurred in an appreciable% of AD cases(20. 8 %). Using commonly available assay products.

Non‐atopic patients rarely showed positive reactions to Dp (0. 75 %), when strict criteria for readings were applied and if 2 readings were performed, Patients with positive patch tests did not necessarily show positive immediate skin tests. It would be useful to carry out tests systematically in atopic patients, even if it is not yet known what modern treatment would be best for the patient.

40|$|Organic {{matter is}} one of the major {{components}} of the fine particles in Houston. In the present study, fine particulate samples collected at three sites (plus one temporary site) in Houston have been investigated to determine the molecular composition and seasonal variation patterns of individual organic compounds, including n-alkanes, PAH compounds, petroleum biomarkers, alkanoic and alkenoic acids, dicarboxylic acids and levoglucosan. Next, chemical mass balance (CMB) model has been applied to calculate quantitative contributions from major primary emission sources to ambient PM 2. 5 levels. These emission sources include diesel engine trucks, gasoline powered vehicles, wood combustion, paved road <b>dust,</b> food <b>preparation</b> process, vegetative detritus and natural gas combustion. Source profiles suitable for the present CMB model have been developed based on source test results published in literature and our road dust resuspension experiment. Source apportionment shows diesel and gasoline vehicle exhaust to be the major primary contributors to ambient PM 2. 5 collected in Houston. Moreover, 52 % of annual average PM 2. 5 mass measured in the present study can be attributed to secondary formation in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} admitted that for each filtration process using pleated filters, {{at least three}} steps can be distinguished: depth and surface filtration, which are common to flat filters, and surface reduction. This step is caused by inefficient filling of the pleat due to the filter geometry. For combustion aerosol, it has been proved that this third step strongly depends on the filtration velocity resulting in an increase of the resistance when air flow decreases. This observation leads one to think that Brownian diffusion, higher for low velocities, could influence the clogging dynamic of a pleated filter. In this article, a protocol derived from the <b>dust</b> cake <b>preparation</b> method published by Schmidt is developed. The {{aim of this study}} is to measure the aerosol penetration inside a filter media as well as in a pleat using a scanning electronic microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elementary detection. This method has also been extended to the study of pleated filters to measure the particle distribution inside the pleat. Filters were loaded with nanoparticles in order to evaluate the specificity of the diffusional regime on the clogging of pleated HEPA filters. For pleated filters, two filtration velocities were investigated: 2. 5 and 0. 2 cm/s...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparison}} to mid latitude cloud cover, knowledge of polar cirrus and other cloud cover is limited. The interpretations of satellite-based cloud imaging and retrievals in polar regions have major problems due to {{factors such as}} darkness and extreme low temperatures. Beginning in 2002 a NASA orbiting lidar instrument, GLAS, (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) will unambiguously define cloud type and fraction with good coverage of polar regions. Active laser sensing gives the spatial and temporal distribution of clouds and diamond <b>dust.</b> In <b>preparation</b> for, and supplementing the GLAS measurements are ground based MP (micro pulse) lidar experiments providing continuous profiling. MP lidar installations have been operating at the South Pole since December 1999 and at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program arctic site since 1996. Both at the ARM Barrow, Alaska site and at the South Pole station, Fourier-transform interferometers also observe clouds in the wavelength intervals between approximately 5 and 18 microns. Spectral instruments can yield cloud microphysical properties with additional information from lidar about the vertical extent of clouds being modeled. We examine the simultaneous lidar and spectral data from both Barrow and South Pole, to obtain cloud properties (optical depth, particle size) {{by the use of}} both instruments. The results have applications to interpretation of current satellite data, and GLAS measurements when available...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the a-quartz {{contents}} {{measured by}} different analytical techniques (X-ray dif-fraction, direct method; and infrared spectrophotometry, {{direct and indirect}} methods) were compared. The analyses were carried out on filters sampled in an industrial setting {{by means of a}} Dorr-Oliver cyclone. To verify the methodology used, filters loaded with pure a-quartz were also analysed. By and large, the agreement between the two direct methods was close on average, but {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the individual results, considerable differences exist. In absolute value, the mean relative deviation between the two techniques was < 25 % in only 47. 8 % of the cases. The results obtained by the indirect method (infrared) were on average 13 % lower than the results obtained by the two direct methods with a more important differ-ence (23 %) for samples where calcite was identified by X-ray diffraction in comparison with those where it was not (8 %). This underestimation, which was not owing to <b>dust</b> losses during <b>preparation,</b> is probably explained by the elimination of organic compounds during dust cal-cinations or by the transformation of mineral compounds. The indirect method introduces additional sample handling operations with more risk of material loss. When the quantity of calcined material was < 0. 4 mg, the weighing operations necessary to correct any losses of material resulted in considerable variability. In terms of overall uncertainty, it would be better in this case not to carry out correction and to employ an operating mode favouring the recovery of a maximum of material while accepting a bias of about 5 – 7 %...|$|R
40|$|The Eco-design {{directive}} {{published by}} the European Union aims at 34 TWh of annual savings with industrial fans by the year 2020. This is about 10 % of the total saving aim of 366 TWh. Electric motors are still responsible for over 40 % of the planned savings with 135 TWh of annual savings by 2020. These aims are translated into European directives to guide the market towards more energy efficient systems. An evolution within those regulations {{is the fact that}} directives are not only focusing on one particular part in the drive system (e. g. the induction motor), but consider the entire system with all its parts to rise the overall system energy efficiency. Examples of this total system approach are the latest EU directives on circulator pumps [1] [2], air conditioning systems [3], domestic comfort fans [3] and industrial fans [4]. This system approach demands a thorough analysis of all the different parts of the drive system {{in order to make a}} sound technical and economical choice on which part to invest to rise the overall system efficiency. This paper describes a practical case study carried out on an industrial <b>dust</b> extractor in <b>preparation</b> of a new research project proposal in which o. a. the EU-directive 327 / 2011 [4] will be investigated. The different drive parts were analyzed based on their efficiency and replaced if technically and economically feasible. Research and test bench results of previous and on-going research projects on energy efficiency were used to predict the potential savings. At each step energy consumption measurements were carried out before and after to validate the estimated savings...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin- 33 (IL- 33) {{activates}} group 2 innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILC 2), resulting in T-helper- 2 inflammation in bronchial asthma. Airway epithelial cells {{were reported as}} sources of IL- 33 during apoptosis and necrosis. However, IL- 33 {{is known to be}} from sources other than airway epithelial cells such as leukocytes, and the mechanisms of IL- 33 production and release are not fully understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify the role of IL- 33 production by monocytes in airway inflammation. BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with a house <b>dust</b> mite (HDM) <b>preparation.</b> Airway inflammation was assessed by quantifying inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and IL- 25, IL- 33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) levels in lung. Immunohistochemistry for IL- 33 in lung sections was also performed. Ly 6 c, CD 11 b, and CD 11 c expression was examined by flow cytometry. Clodronate liposomes were used in the HDM-airway inflammation model to deplete circulating monocytes. The IL- 33, but not IL- 25 or TSLP, level in lung homogenates was markedly increased in HDM mice compared to control mice. IL- 33 -positive cells in the lungs were identified using immunohistochemistry and were increased in areas surrounding bronchi and vasculature. Furthermore, IL- 33 levels were increased in mononuclear cells derived from lungs of HDM mice compared to controls. The expression of Ly 6 c in mononuclear cells was significantly higher in HDM mice than in controls. Treatment with clodronate liposomes led to inhibition of not only inflammatory cells in BAL fluid, airway hyper reactivity and Th 2 cytokines in lung, but also IL- 33 in lung. IL- 33 from monocytes recruited to the lung may contribute to the pathogenesis of HDM-induced airway inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Laboratories measure lead {{concentrations}} in either clinical samples such as blood and urine or in environmental samples such as paint and dust. It {{is important to}} distinguish between the clinical and environmental lead laboratories and the issues that they face. Often, laboratories are separated according to the types of samples they analyze even though the technologies used to measure lead levels may be similar. Several reasons exist for separating laboratories along sample lines. For example, clinical and environmental laboratories operate under different federal or state regulations. Sample handling and reporting requirements of state and federal agencies differ, as do requirements for quality control. The reportable concentration range for lead in paint or in <b>dust,</b> and the <b>preparation</b> of the sample requires different procedures. Further, the higher concentrations of lead typically found in lead-based paint (> 0. 5 % by weight) and in lead contaminated dust (> 1 mg/g) present the potential for contaminating the laboratory environment. If environmental and clinical laboratory functions are carried out in the same laboratory room, determination of the much lower concentrations of lead found in blood is jeopardized. For all clinical laboratories in the United States, the Health Care Financing Agency (HCFA), operating under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), regulates all aspects of laboratory operation including determining the qualifications of a laboratory director and establishing protocols for quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) activities, method validation, specimen collection, storage, analysis and reporting of results (42 CFR Part 493). For blood lead laboratories specifically, successful participation in an approved proficiency testing (PT) program is required. In addition, many states regulate the operation of clinical laboratories under their jurisdiction although the requirements vary greatly from state to state. Laboratorie...|$|R
40|$|Dust is {{a source}} of {{contamination}} of land, water and the atmosphere, and is of special concern owing to its trace metal content. There is a significant body of literature describing the use of deposited dusts as indicators of environmental pollution, particularly by trace metals. While several authors have identified the need for standardized guidelines on sampling techniques and on analytical procedures, few have addressed the problems in sufficient depth to produce such guidelines. Since some of the early papers on this topic, more is known about the chemical nature of dusts and the association of certain metals with components of the matrix. This information provides useful guidance on analytical techniques and methods for dissolution of samples. In the analysis of trace elements in dusts, a prerequisite is to prepare a solution for analysis. A variety of methods have been used to digest dust samples for determination of trace metals, and this can make it difficult to compare the results from different studies. Whether total or available metal content is determined is just one uncertainty needing resolution. Time requirements range from 15 min to 24 h, and this is another variability that may make results incomparable, while the great amounts of acids and long digestion times may result in contamination. For over 20 years, microwave ovens have found increasing use and have been used to digest various kinds of samples, such as rocks, sediments, ores, soils, coal, fly ash, water, sludge and biological and botanical samples. This article describes the efficiency of various acids for the digestion of dust, both by traditional methods and using amicrowave oven. The latter technique offers an advantageous route for the digestion of <b>dust</b> samples in <b>preparation</b> for trace metal analysis. Speed and good recovery coupled with less risk of contamination through the limited amounts of reagents required combine to make this an excellent choice in the suite of techniques for environmental analysis. General reviews of analytical methods demonstrate the dominance of atomic absorption methods for the analysis of trace metals such as lead and cadmium in a variety of samples. This pattern is generally found for work on metals in dusts, with flame atomic absorption predominating for Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni and Cu. Other techniques have included neutron activation (NA) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES). Polarography in the form of differential-pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) is suitable for the simultaneous determination of trace quantities of Pb and Cd in dust. The method gives good reproducibility and has the added advantages of being relatively cheap, quick and simple. Interferences and means for overcoming their effects will be outlined. The aim of analysis of dusts is to represent environmental quality. This necessitates appropriate presentation of the data from the analysis, and some issues relating to this will be outlined. Dusts will always present a potential route of contamination by trace metals and organic substances and the need for future work in this area will not diminish. Only by the application of good quality control, the use of reference materials and reliable techniques and an understanding of the significance of the results can confidence be placed in a useful approach to environmental quality assessment...|$|R
