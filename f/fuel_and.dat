5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oxygen rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E

5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save <b>fuel,</b> <b>and</b> there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 7:40pm, the 727 {{took off}} with only Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson aboard. Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> turning back near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study interfuel {{substitution}} in various sectors of the Greek economy. An econometric model, utilizing the translog cost function, is estimated for three major sectors of the economy - agriculture, industry (disaggregated, also, into three branches) <b>and</b> transport. <b>Fuels</b> are aggregated into three categories: solid <b>fuels,</b> liquid <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> electricity. The model is estimated using time-series data over the period 1960 - 1980. The results indicate substitutability between liquid <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> electricity, mainly complementarity between liquid <b>and</b> solid <b>fuels,</b> <b>and</b> substitutability between electricity <b>and</b> solid <b>fuels.</b> © 1986...|$|R
