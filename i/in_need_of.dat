5|$|A. macrodactylum is {{a member}} of the Ambystomatidae, also known as the mole salamanders.

The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the salamanders capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, distributed in eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> further testing.|$|E
