5|$|The Daily Express ran {{the story}} on 1 October 1994. They {{reported}} that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E

40|$|Is {{desire to}} <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> {{response}} to positive emotions an 'obese' eating style: a style {{more prevalent in}} people with obesity? In other words: Is Kummerspeck (German: sorrow-fat) for some people a misnomer? This question was addressed in three studies on women. Study 1 (n = 188) tested the moderator effect of subjective well-being on the association of BMI with the scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions (DEBQ-E). Study 2 tested in women (n = 832) whether items on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions loaded on the same factor as those in response to negative emotions and body mass. Study 3 assessed in the total sample (n = 203) and an overweight subsample (n = 40) a) whether self-reported desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions predicted actual food intake and b) whether this also held true over and above self-reported desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions. Study 1 showed only for women with low positive affect a significant positive association of BMI with DEBQ-E. In Study 2, only items on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions loaded on the same factor as BMI. Study 3 : In the total sample, the significant effect on food intake of the scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to positive emotions disappeared when a scale on desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions {{was added to the}} model. In the overweight-subsample there was only an effect on food intake for desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions. It is concluded that only desire to <b>eat</b> <b>in</b> response to negative emotions is an 'obese' eating style, suggesting that Kummerspeck is not a misnomer...|$|R
50|$|The body of Christ is given, taken, and <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> the Supper, {{only after}} a heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of Christ is {{received}} and <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> the Supper is faith.|$|R
5|$|Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before old ones have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable <b>eating.</b> <b>In</b> severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.|$|E
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|During the narration, Rihanna and {{her lover}} are {{depicted}} in both love and hate scenarios. Before the song begins to play, lightning bolts are projected onto {{a wall in}} which Rihanna stands in front of. She and her lover are depicted as enamored with each other, and enjoying activities such as fairground rides and <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> fast food restaurants. During the chorus, images of drugs, pills, and dilated pupils are shown, while brief scenes of Rihanna and her boyfriend preparing to have sex are shown.|$|E

5|$|Lately, Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> the fight and it falls to the ground below.|$|E
50|$|Pork {{brains are}} {{considered}} a delicacy and are <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> the deep fried quesadilla de sesos. Beef and pork liver are regularly eaten pan-fried with onion or breaded and deep-fried. The pork ears, feet and snout are pickled and <b>eaten</b> <b>in</b> tostadas.|$|R

In North Africa, Uromastyx species are considered dhaab or 'fish of the desert' and eaten by nomadic tribes.|$|R
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> {{the first two years of}} her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished <b>eating.</b> <b>In</b> some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

25|$|According to Rabbi Isaac Klein, a Conservative Jew {{ought to}} cover his head when in the synagogue, at prayer or sacred study, when {{engaging}} in a ritual act, and when <b>eating.</b> <b>In</b> the mid-19th century, Reformers led by Isaac Wise completely rejected the kippot after an altercation in which Rabbi Wise's kippah was knocked off his head.|$|E
25|$|Research {{in applied}} {{psychology}} has investigated practices of meat <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> relation to morality, emotions, cognition, and personality characteristics. Psychological research suggests meat eating is correlated with masculinity, support for social hierarchy, and reduced openness to experience. Research into the consumer psychology of meat is relevant both to meat industry marketing and to advocates of reduced meat consumption.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} Hindu {{groups that have}} {{continued}} to abide by a strict vegetarian diet in modern times. Some adhere to a diet that is devoid of meat, eggs, and seafood. Food affects body, mind and spirit in Hindu beliefs. Hindu texts such as Śāṇḍilya Upanishad and Svātmārāma recommend Mitahara (<b>eating</b> <b>in</b> moderation) {{as one of the}} Yamas (virtuous self restraints). The Bhagavad Gita links body and mind to food one consumes in verses 17.8 through 17.10.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{segregation}} is {{the separation}} of humans into socially-constructed racial groups in daily life. It may apply to activities such as <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home. Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even {{when there is no}} strong individual preference for it, as suggested by Thomas Schelling's models of segregation and subsequent work.|$|E
25|$|Travelling {{south in}} the summer, she met Charles at Kineton, near Edgehill, before {{travelling}} on to the royal capital in Oxford. The journey through the contested Midlands {{was not an easy}} one, and Prince Rupert was sent to Stratford-upon-Avon to escort her. Despite the difficulties of the journey, Henrietta Maria greatly enjoyed herself, <b>eating</b> <b>in</b> the open air with her soldiers and meeting friends along the way. She arrived in Oxford bringing fresh supplies to great acclaim; poems were written in her honour, and Jermyn, her chamberlain, was given a peerage by the King at her request.|$|E
