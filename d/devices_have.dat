They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been designed to act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope {{can also be used}} as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E

50|$|The RM52XX {{series was}} the first product line sold {{directly}} by QED. The first of the series was a cost-reduced version of the R5000 with smaller caches and a different pin-out.

The RM523X <b>devices</b> <b>had</b> 32-bit system buses while RM526X had 64-bit system buses. This product line was very successful in the laser printer market, winning many accounts at printer companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark, Ricoh, Samsung.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s mobile <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> become more widely available, {{advancing}} beyond simple communication devices, {{and have been}} found to be rich forms of information, even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics. Despite this, digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media, largely due to problems over the proprietary nature of devices.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigation is}} {{not restricted to}} retrieve data merely from the computer, as laws are breached by the criminals and small digital devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, flash drives) are now extensively used. Some of these <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> volatile memory while some have non-volatile memory. Sufficient methodologies are available to retrieve data from volatile memory, however, there is lack of detailed methodology or a framework for data retrieval from non-volatile memory sources. Depending {{on the type of}} devices, media or artifacts, digital forensics investigation is branched into various types.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E

5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. High-tech <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some {{can be used as}} environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} emerges from {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been found to be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E

5|$|The {{prominent}} markings that criss-cross {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of the markings, reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, but scientists cannot confirm that, because no data collection <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB <b>devices</b> <b>have</b> some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
