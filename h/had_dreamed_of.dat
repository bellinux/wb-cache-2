5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. Now their son Waters was a retired millionaire, and {{interested only in}} preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E

5|$|Ramachandran <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> {{making his}} own film {{ever since he}} {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi Mannan. The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E
25|$|Originally the {{engineer}} planned {{and built a}} third reservoir, the Naurouze, but it was abandoned in 1680 due to its excessive silting.

A floodway was quickly dug to drain the Naurouze basin from the south.|$|E

Shortly after she got out, her husband filed for divorce.|$|E

25|$|On 25 November 2006, Ronaldinho scored his 50th career league goal against Villarreal, {{then later}} scored {{a second time}} with an {{overhead}} bicycle kick. He later said to reporters that the latter was a goal he <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> scoring {{since he was a}} boy. He scored once and set up two others in Barcelona's 4–0 Club World Cup win over Mexico's Club América on 14 December, but Barcelona were defeated 1–0 by Brazilian club Internacional in the final. Ronaldinho was the recipient of the Bronze Ball Award for the competition.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on 1 February 1817, Montgelas {{had been}} dismissed; and Bavaria had entered {{on a new}} era of {{constitutional}} reform. This implied no breach with the European policy of the fallen minister. In the new German confederation Bavaria had assumed the role of defender of the smaller states against the ambitions of Austria and Prussia. Montgelas <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a Bavarian hegemony in South Germany similar to that of Prussia in the north. It was to obtain popular support for this policy and for the Bavarian claims on Baden that the crown prince pressed for a liberal constitution, the reluctance of Montgelas to concede it being the cause of his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|From her childhood, Thérèse <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> {{the desert}} to which God would some day lead her. Now she had entered that desert. Though she was now reunited with Marie and Pauline, {{from the first day}} she began her {{struggle}} to win and keep her distance from her sisters. Right at the start Marie de Gonzague, the prioress, had turned the postulant Thérèse over to her eldest sister Marie, who was to teach her to follow the Divine Office. Later she appointed Thérèse assistant to Pauline in the refectory. And when her cousin Marie Guerin also entered, she employed the two together in the sacristy.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the colonial}} era, South Carolina's {{politicians}} <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> an inland waterway {{system that would}} not only aid commerce, but also control flooding. By the 1930s, Byrnes took up the cause for a massive dam-building project, Santee Cooper, that would not only accomplish those tasks but also electrify the entire state with hydroelectric power. With South Carolina financially strapped by the Great Depression, Senator Byrnes {{managed to get the}} federal government to authorize a loan for the entire project, which was completed and put into operation in February 1942. The loan was later paid back to the federal government with full interest and at no cost to South Carolina taxpayers. Santee Cooper has continued to be a model for public-owned electrical utilities worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Helena Lopata {{argued that}} a Polish {{nationalism}} grew in Polish Americans during World War I, but fell sharply afterward. Polish immigrants to the United States did not know much about Poland aside from their local villages. In preparation for World War I, the Polish government asked for donations using appeals {{on behalf of the}} safety of their loved ones back home, as well as promises of a good high status back in Poland when they returned home. Lopata found that after World War I, many Polish Americans continued to receive requests for aid in Poland, and feelings of anger for all the years they had delayed bettering their own situation were common. Return immigrants who <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> using their American savings to buy status symbols in Poland (farmlands, houses, etc.) were still treated as peasants in Poland, creating resentment towards the motherland.|$|E
25|$|Zamenhof {{would later}} {{say that he}} <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a world {{language}} {{since he was a}} child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled Швейцарская (švejtsarskaja, a porter's lodge – from швейцар švejtsar, a porter) and Кондитерская (konditerskaja, a confectioner's shop – from кондитер konditer, a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.|$|E

500|$|Berkman and Goldman {{spent much}} of 1920 {{traveling}} through Russia collecting material for a proposed Museum of the Revolution.

500|$|The {{historical}} {{borders of}} the Holy Empire were also used as grounds for territorial revisionism by the NSDAP, laying claim to modern territories and states that were once part of it. Even before the war, Hitler <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> reversing the Peace of Westphalia, which had given the territories of the Empire almost complete sovereignty. On November 17, 1939, Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that the [...] "total liquidation" [...] of this historic treaty was the [...] "great goal" [...] of the Nazi regime, and that since it had been signed in Münster, {{it would also be}} officially repealed in the same city.|$|E
