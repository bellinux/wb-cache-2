He also published it in other cities as well: in Washington, D.C., between 1853 and 1857 (during his tenure as Head of the U.S. Census), continuing until 1860, then in Charleston, SC, 1861-1862.

The magazine's publication was disrupted during the American Civil War after August 1864 but resumed publication again in January 1866. After 1880, it underwent {{a number of}} name revisions, and in 1884, it was either renamed to or absorbed by the Agricultural Review and Industrial Monthly of New York.

500|$|Southern {{interest}} in railroads in general, and the Pacific railroad in particular, accelerated after {{the conclusion of}} the Mexican–American War in 1848. During that war, topographical officers William H. Emory and James W. Abert had conducted surveys that demonstrated the feasibility of a railroad's originating in El Paso or western Arkansas and ending in San Diego. [...] J. D.

2500|$|The South {{reacted with}} an {{elaborate}} intellectual defense of slavery. J. D. B. <b>DeBow</b> of New Orleans established De Bow's Review in 1846, which quickly grew {{to become the}} leading Southern magazine, warning {{about the dangers of}} depending on the North economically. De Bow's Review also emerged as the leading voice for secession. The magazine emphasized the South's economic inequality, relating it to the concentration of manufacturing, shipping, banking and international trade in the North. Searching for Biblical passages endorsing slavery and forming economic, sociological, historical and scientific arguments, slavery went from being a [...] "necessary evil" [...] to a [...] "positive good". Dr. John H. Van Evrie's book Negroes and Negro slavery: The First an Inferior Race: The Latter Its Normal Condition—setting out the arguments the title would suggest—was an attempt to apply scientific support to the Southern arguments in favor of race-based slavery.|$|E
