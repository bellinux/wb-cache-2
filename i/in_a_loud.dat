5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E

5|$|Sarumpaet {{was born}} on 16 July 1949 in Tarutung, North Tapanuli Regency, North Sumatra. She was the fifth of ten {{children}} born to Saladin Sarumpaet, Minister of Defence in the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebel government, and Julia Hutabarat, a women's rights activist. Both were also prominent in the Christian community. Three of her siblings– Mutiara Sani, Riris Sarumpaet and Sam Sarumpaet– {{are members of the}} Indonesian art community. As a teenager she moved to Jakarta to study there, finishing her high school studies at PSKD Menteng. In his biography, her classmate Chrisye recalled that Sarumpaet was very confident; he noted that she enjoyed writing poetry and then reading it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice while other students were engaging in other activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often ending <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> high-pitched crescendo, {{which is}} given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E

25|$|The Dirac {{communicator}} provides instantaneous faster-than-light communication across space. Ursula K. Le Guin's ansible {{is often}} compared to it. It {{first appeared in}} his classic short story Beep (1955), which tells of its most remarkable property: every Dirac transmission ever made is repeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> beep of noise {{at the beginning of}} every signal. Analysis of the beep reveals these messages from past, present and future.|$|E
25|$|That morning, Colonel Israel Angell's 2nd Rhode Island Regiment was ferried {{across the}} Delaware from Fort Mifflin to assist Greene's 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Altogether, Greene {{commanded}} about 500 defenders. Soon afterward, a Hessian drummer beat a parley and Major Charles Stuart, {{accompanied by a}} Hessian officer, came forward to demand the fort's surrender. Greene sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeremiah Olney to meet the British major. Though Stuart threatened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice that no quarter would {{be given to the}} defenders, Olney refused. Du Plessis later related to François-Jean de Chastellux that Stuart's overbearing tone inspired the defenders to greater resistance.|$|E
25|$|The hymn is {{of great}} antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event {{assigned}} by the Greek Menology as connected to its origin. The tradition recounts that {{during the reign of}} Theodosius II (408-450), Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the emperor and the Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople (434-446) were praying for heavenly assistance, a child was suddenly lifted into midair, to whom all cried out Kyrie eleison ('Lord, have mercy'). The child was then seen to descend again to the earth, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice he exhorted the people to pray : 'Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal'. After giving this exhortation, the child died.|$|E

25|$|There were testimonies of {{sightings}} of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews {{stayed in the}} smoking room for some time, then continued assisting with the evacuation. At around 2:00a.m., he was seen back on the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but there were still women reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and {{to draw attention to}} himself, Andrews waved his arms and announced to them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to cling to in the water, though he may have been mistaken for chief baker Charles Joughin, who survived the sinking and reported doing the same thing. He then headed towards the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship in its final moments. His body was never recovered.|$|E

500|$|Orledge {{writes that}} the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better {{integrated}} than the first two; they contain [...] "more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before." [...] There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses-caprices are, in Orledge's words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> and spectacular manner.|$|E

500|$|Swift desired for Caillat to sing {{background}} vocals but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> manner, {{enough for}} audiences to recognize who sang backup. Originally Swift and Caillat were only to harmonize in the chorus, but as Caillat recorded, Swift decided to include her voice more throughout the track {{because of how}} impressed she was. Swift first recorded the entire song, and Caillat then recorded background vocals separately. Swift was {{very pleased with the}} finished product: [...] "I think she sounds beautiful on it. I'm so excited to have her voice on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|The call {{is a low}} drumming, {{accompanied}} by a tuk, tuk, tuk made with the wings. The nature of the vocalisation led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet. Gerd Heinrich noted the local name [...] "soisa", meaning drum, and described the call as being a subdued drumming purre – purre – purre – purre – purre which sometimes ends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> shrill scream. The bird also produced a dull hum similar {{to the voice of}} the banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus) and reminiscent of the call of the snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni). Calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening, and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird. A quieter version of the call is given at the nest.|$|E

500|$|In a July 1951 {{profile in}} Book of the Month Club News, Salinger's friend and New Yorker editor William Maxwell asked Salinger about his {{literary}} influences. Salinger responded: [...] "A writer, when he's asked {{to discuss his}} craft, ought {{to get up and}} call out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice just the names of the writers he loves. I love Kafka, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Proust, O'Casey, Rilke, Lorca, Keats, Rimbaud, Burns, E. Brontë, Jane Austen, Henry James, Blake, Coleridge. I won't name any living writers. I don't think it's right" [...] (although O'Casey was in fact living at the time). In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently deceased, writers: Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as [...] "Fitzgerald's successor". Salinger's [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" [...] has an ending similar to that of Fitzgerald's earlier published short story [...] "May Day".|$|E
500|$|..... I seem {{still to}} hear the brave d'Hautpoul saying to His Majesty, {{just as he was}} {{galloping}} off to charge the enemy: [...] "Sire, I am going to show you my big heels; they will go into the enemies' squares as if they were made of butter!" [...] An hour later he was dead. One of his regiments while fighting in an interval of the Russian army, was shot down and cut to pieces by the Cossacks; only eighteen of them escaped. General d'Hautpoul, three times forced to recoil with his division, thrice rallied them to the charge; the third time, he again rushed on the enemy, crying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice: [...] "Cuirassiers, forward, in the name of God! forward, my brave cuirassiers!" [...] But grapeshot had mowed down too many of these heroes. Very few of them were in condition to follow their leader, who fell, covered with wounds, {{in the middle of a}} Russian square into which he had flung himself almost alone.|$|E
500|$|Attendance grew {{annually}} {{throughout the}} 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but {{the onset of}} the Great Depression resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick. [...] Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event. [...] The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely. One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties. Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal. [...] His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees. [...] Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.|$|E
