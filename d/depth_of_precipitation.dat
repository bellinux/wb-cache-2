30|$|Among {{parameters}} affecting asphaltene precipitation, production rate, tubing and choke sizes {{have the}} most impact on precipitation process. As production rate increases from 4000 to 7000 STB/day, the length of tubing covered by asphaltene deposition enhances about 40 %; however, a decrease in the production rate to reduce this interval is not desirable. Tubing size has an inverse effect on precipitation length. As a matter of fact, in this case, as the tubing diameter increases from 3 to 7 inches, the precipitation interval reduces about 2500 ft. In addition, a greater increase in the tubing size results in more <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> initiation. The choke size results in the same effect on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> initiation as the production rate does because generally, an increase in choke size is directly proportional to the production rate.|$|E

To assess the possibility of shallow landslides at different precipitation levels, a method to draw slope units and steepest slope profiles based on ARCtools and a new method for calculating slope stability are proposed. The methods were implemented in a case study conducted in Yan’an, north-west China. High resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model) images, soil parameters from in-situ laboratory measurements and maximum <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> infiltration were used as input parameters in the method. Next, DEM and reverse DEM were employed to map 2146 slope units in the study area, based on which the steepest profiles of the slope units were constructed. Combining analysis of the water content of loess, strength of the sliding surface, its response to precipitation and the infinite slope stability equation, a new equation to calculate infinite slope stability is proposed to assess shallow landslide stability. The slope unit stability was calculated using the equation at 10 -, 20 -, 50 - and 100 -year return periods <b>of</b> antecedent effective <b>precipitation.</b> The number <b>of</b> slope units experiencing failure increased in response to increasing effective antecedent rainfall.

40|$|Abstract Israel is a {{small country}} which {{experiences}} wide variations in magnitudes of extreme discharges. A consistent model has been constructed for prediction of such discharges throughout the country. Extreme flow characteristics, geographical proximity, lithology, soils, and rainfall properties are the major factors in the delineation of relatively homogeneous regions within the country. For each region, discharge-area relationships are formulated in association with low exceedance probabilities. These relationships follow at-site predictions which have been prepared by fitting the log Pearson type III distribution to annual maxima series of peak discharges. For catchments larger than 100 km 2 in area, {{the differences between the}} regional and the at-site predictions are small. Relatively high extreme discharges are found for the arid area where rainfall depth is low, for an area of steep slopes, for areas of low permeable lithology and soils, and for areas where the fraction of intense rainfall in the total <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> is high. For large arid catchments, the discharge- area relationships exhibit a negative trend. The model is simply applicable and appears suitable for other semiarid and arid areas...|$|E

40|$|Abundant {{and various}} diagenetic carbonates were {{recovered}} from a 1084 -m-thick, Quaternary to lower Miocene section at ODP Site 799 in the Japan Sea. Petrographic, XRD, SEM, EDS-chemical, and isotopic analyses revealed wide variations in occurrence and textural relations and complex mineralogy and chemistry. Diagenetic carbonates include calcite, calcium-rich rhodochrosite, iron- and manganese-rich magnesite, iron- and manganese-rich dolomite and ankerite, and iron- and manganeserich lansfordite (hydrous Mg-carbonate). Rhodochrosite commonly occurs as small, solid nodules and semi-indurated, thin layers in bioturbated, mottled sediments of Units I and II (late Miocene to Quaternary). Lansfordite occurs as unindurated nodules and layers in Unit II (late Miocene and Pliocene), whereas magnesite forms indurated beds a few centimeters thick in slightly bioturbated-to-faintly laminated sediments of Unit III (middle and late Miocene). Some rhodochrosite nodules have dark-colored, pyritic cores, and some pyrite-rhodochrosite nodules are overgrown by and included within magnesite beds. Dolomite and ankerite tend to form thick beds (> 10 cm) in bedded to laminated sediments of Units III, IV, and V (early to late Miocene). Calcite occurs sporadically throughout the Site 799 sediments. The d 18 O values of carbonates and the interstitial waters, and the measured geothermal gradient indicate {{that almost all of}} the Site 799 carbonates are not in isotopic equilibrium with the ambient waters, but were precipitated in the past when the sediments were at shallower <b>depths.</b> <b>Depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> obtained from the d 18 O of carbonates span from 310 to 510 mbsf for magnesite and from 60 to 580 mbsf for dolomite-ankerite. Rhodochrosite and calcite are estimated to have formed within sediments at depths shallower than 80 mbsf. Diagenetic history in the Site 799 sediments have been determined primarily by the environment of deposition; in particular, by the oxidation-reduction state of the bottom waters and the alkalinity level of the interstitial waters. Under the well-oxygenated bottom-water conditions in the late Miocene and Pliocene, manganese initially accumulated on the seafloor as hydrogenous oxides and subsequently was mobilized and reprecipitated as rhodochrosite within the shallow sulfate-reduction, sub-oxic zone. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>of</b> lansfordite occurred in the near-surface sediments with abundant organic carbon and an extremely high alkalinity during the latest Miocene and Pliocene.

Two common parameters calculated for extreme precipitation purposes are probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF).

IDF calculations are used in a variety of precipitation-related tasks, including PMP. The primary agency responsible for establishing standards for PMP and IDF has been the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) – see, for example, U. S. Department of Commerce(1994). Specific regional and local analyses have generally been performed by local agencies or private contractors.

The PMP represents the greatest <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> for a given duration that is meteorologically possible for a watershed or an area {{at a particular time}} of year, with no allowance made for long-term climatic trends. Various methods are in use for estimation of PMP over a target location corresponding to different durations. Moisture maximization method and Hershfield method are two widely used methods. The former method maximizes the observed storms assuming that the atmospheric moisture would rise up to a very high value estimated based on the maximum daily dew point temperature. On the other hand, the latter method is a statistical method based on a general frequency equation given by Chow. The present study provides one-day PMP estimates and PMP maps for Mahanadi river basin based on the aforementioned methods. There is a need for such estimates and maps, as the river basin is prone to frequent floods. Utility of the constructed PMP maps in computing PMP for various catchments in the river basin is demonstrated.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the version- 5 precipitation radar (PR; algorithm 2 A 25) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI; algorithm 2 A 12) rainfall products is performed across the Tropics in two ways: 1) by comparing long-term TRMM rainfall products with Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) global rain gauge analyses and 2) by comparing the rainfall estimates from the PR and TMI on a rainfall feature-by-feature basis within the narrow swath of the PR using a 1 -yr database of classified precipitation features (PFs). The former is done to evaluate the overall biases of the TMI and PR relative to ‘‘ground truth’’ to examine regional differences in the estimates; the latter allows a direct comparison of the estimates with the same sampling area, also identifying relative biases {{as a function of}} storm type. This study finds that the TMI overestimates rainfall in most of the deep Tropics and midlatitude warm seasons over land with respect to both the GPCC gauge analysis and the PR (which agrees well with the GPCC gauges in the deep Tropics globally), in agreement with past results. The PR is generally higher than the TMI in midlatitude cold seasons over land areas with gauges. The analysis by feature type reveals that the TMI overestimates relative to the PR are due to overestimates in mesoscale convective systems and in most features with 85 -GHz polarization-corrected temperature of less than 250 K (i. e., with a significant optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> ice).

Occurrence of rain continues into {{the flow of}} the discharge in the river with a huge energy potential that can be exploited {{for the life of the}} surrounding community.

The amount of runoff produced by the same <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> in a watershed will result a different magnitude with another watershed because it is influenced by land use in the watershed.

40|$|Flash floods are {{an ongoing}} threat {{to life and}} {{property}} in the Northeast US and are generally studied as natural phenomena resulting from extreme weather. This dissertation approaches flash floods from a different perspective, in which I explore not only landscape and atmospheric variables, but also the role of people and the built environment. In the first part, I use a spatial model to predict flash flood reports {{as a function of}} landscape variables and human population. I find that flash flood reports are correlated with spatially varying slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (k sat), and impervious area. The model improves when population is included, indicating a reporting bias toward populated areas. In the second part I assess natural and anthropogenic landscape variables of 180 watersheds affected by flash floods. I create a runoff type classification system based on precipitation rate and the amount (<b>depth)</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> resulting from a storm combined with soil properties of k sat and soil moisture deficit in the watershed. This analysis demonstrates that saturation excess runoff, infiltration excess runoff, and poor drainage all contribute to flash floods in the Northeast US. In the third part, I assess one aspect of built infrastructure by calculating the suitability of road culverts to convey runoff from a 5 -year design storm. Suitability varies by study watershed and by road ownership with roads owned by New York State being more likely to have suitable culverts than roads owned by county and local governments. I find no significant relationships between culvert suitability and slope, impervious area, or k sat at the watershed scale. At the town level, population is positively correlated with culvert suitability, but median income is not significantly correlated. This work demonstrates that the presence of people and their alterations to the landscape contribute to the incidence of flash floods in the Northeast US. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E

Une période sèche se définit comme une série de jours avec pluies quotidiennes inférieures à un seuil donné.

One form of drought is the interruption of {{the rainy season}} by a sa called dry spell. Dry spell {{can be defined as}} a sequence of dry days including days with less than a threshold value of rainfall. A dry spell, defined a on daily scale, becomes untraceable by statistics using longer than one-day-long equidistant time intervals. If the daily discretization of the rainy season is te be avoided, an intermediate technique is needed. Event-based analysis of the rainfall and dry spell provides This approach. The method is demonstrated with data from the Dodoma Region, situated in the semiarid highlands of Tanzania. The climate is characterized by one rainy tesson from the and of November until the end of April. The occurrence of rainfall is erratic. The average seasonal precipitation is about 600 mm with variations between 450 and over 800 mm. Rainy seasons are separated by an almosl 7 month long dry season. During the rainy season convective type storms prevail. Single storms lasi a few hours, but their occurrence is clearly grouped within the timespan of a few days, separated by the dry spells which are usually much longer. Conventional statistics of dry spells are summarized in tables 1 and 2 using 1. 0 mm daily precipitation as the threshold. It is shown that dry spells occur randomly during the rainy season. For the event-based analysis dry spell is detined as a dry event. Dry events are considered as a sequence of dry days separated by rainfall events from each other. Thus the rainy season is detined as a series of rainfall and subsequent dry events. Rainfall events are defined as the uninterupted sequence of rainy days, when at least on one day more than a threshold amount of rainfall has been observed- Rainy days with less Man the threshold <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> are accounted for the rainfall event if they occur in an uninterrupted sequence. Only isolated subthreshold rainfall will be discarded, and considered as part of a dry event (fig. 2). ln this analysis the threshold value of 5. 0 mm/day was seiected. The comparison of tables 1 and 4 shows that the length of the mean maximum dry spell doubles by replacing the 1. 0 mm/day threshold by 5. 0 mm/day. The sequence of rainfall and dry events is characterized by Dn, m, duration of the mth rainfall of the nth rainy season, and by the inter-event time Zn, m (duration of the dry event) between the end at the preceding and the start of the succeeding rainfall event. In case of convective type storms the series of the subsequent events (either dry or rainfall) could be considered independent, thus their number/season should follow the Poisson distribution. In case of independence of subsequent events, the waiting lime for a new event must follow the exponential pdf. By measuring the waiting time in days the discrets equivalent of the exponential pdf can be used. Since the sequences of convective type storms de not contain purely independent events, the waiting time t follows instead the discrete counterpart of the 2 parameter gamma pdf, the negative binomial pdf. This modified Poisson-modal, Poisson pdf for the number of rainfall events and the negative binomial pdf for the length of the inter-event lime has been applied to describe the rainy season. Table 3 summanzes the parameters r and p for different rein gauges. By focusing on the dry spell event, the duration of the rainfall events Dn, m will in fact be identified as inter-event time. This change of rotes fils the original Poisson model better. Since rainfall events are shorter, their duration follows the geometrical pdf, as theoretically required. The Poisson pdf seems to fit slightly better the number of dry events than the rainfall ones (fig. 5). If has to be pointed out that the event-based definition of the rainy season dues not exactly fit the theoretical precondition, i. e. to have a certain fixed period. Rainy seasons have variable longths, as they are a stochastic fonction of the events themselves. For "modal fitting" the consideration of the core of the rainy season, from January to April would be a better choice. However it would truncate the physical phenomenon wilh the potentiel omission of extrema long dry events. Therefore, in spite of mediocre fitting, the Poisson modal will be used ln analysis. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the statistical characteristics of the dry events for the selected rain gouges for bath the whole, and for the core of the rainy season. Dry events accurring in the core of the rainy season were identified as those ending within the timespan of January -April. The mean lengths of the longest dry spells in the core are less than the corresponding value for the whole season. However, at two stations, Kondoa and Gwandi, in more han 70 % of the season the longest dry spell did occur during the core. This coincidence was only 40 % for the Farkwa rain gauge. For planning purposes, the longest dry spells associated with the varions statistical recurrence periods are derived {{on the basis of the}} fitted Pearson III type probability distribution functions (fig. 6, table 6). The event-based analysis, relying on the expected number ot events/season and the negative binomial pdf for the length of the dry events, can also be used to approximate the distribution of the extreme long dry spells. Contrary to the Pearson III distribution fitted to the seasonal extreme values, the negative binomial pdf f (n) determines the probability that a random dry event would last n days. Consequently, the exceedence probability Pe (N), that an extreme long dry event would occur at least once within a given statistical recurrence period of T years must be equal to the reciprocal value of the product λ•T, where λ denotes the expected number of dry eventslyear (season). λ•T specifies the expected number of "trials" needed to observe at least once the extreme duration of N days associated with the return period of T years. The length of this extreme dry spell can then be obtained from the cumulative negative binomial pdf (table 6). The deviations observed for low number of "trials" between the event-based and the extreme seasonal value approach are due to the conceptual difference. Table 7 displays the simultaneous occurrence of dry events at several rain gauges. By using Farkwa as the reference station, table 7 does not account for dry events that might have occurred simultaneously at Gwandi and Kandoa without having been recorded at Farkwa. Except for the very short (1 or 2 days) and the very long dry events (over 30 days), the overwhelming majority of the dry events occurred at least at two stations simultaneously. Furthermore, excluding the 1, 2 or more than 30 day - long events, more than 63 % of the dry events have been observed at all three stations. Two (or three) dry events were only classified as simultaneous if more than hall of the duration of the reference event at Fartwa was overlapped by an uninterrupted dry event at the other station (s). Event-based analysis, even if it is carried out on the bases of a few years of observation, can rely on large number of data points (table 3). While the expected number of events/season is still derived from very few data, this estimate is more reliable than the approximative expected length of the longest seasonal dry spell, since the variability of the former is usually less than that of the latter, for the same data sets (table 8) ...|$|E

Using a stochastic model of soil-moisture dynamics along with a carbon cost-benefit analysis, a water-optimal root depth is determined as a function of climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics. Changes to precipitation intensity, frequency, and amount affect this depth and the partitioning of soil moisture among evaporation, transpiration, and recharge fluxes. For a given climate – fixed average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration – the optimal root depth and recharge flux both decrease with increasing precipitation frequency (and decreasing intensity). Evaporation increases as the frequency <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> increases, and the transpiration flux often displays a maximum for intermediate values <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> frequenc...|$|R
40|$|Glauconites and {{phosphates}} {{have been}} detected in almost all investigated samples at Sites 798 (uppermost Miocene or lower Pliocene to Pleistocene) and 799 (early middle Miocene to Pleistocene). Autochthonous occurrences appear in very minor quantities (generally below 0. 2 %) throughout the drilled sequences, whereas allochthonous accumulations are limited to the lower Pliocene or uppermost Miocene sequence at Site 798 (glauconites) and to the upper and middle Miocene sequence at Site 799 (upper and middle Miocene: glauconites; middle Miocene: phosphates). X-ray fluorescence, microprobe, and bulk chemical analyses indicate high variabilities in cations and anions and generally low oxide totals. This is probably related to the substitution of phosphate and fluoride aniors by hydroxide and carbonate anions in phosphates and to the depletion of iron, aluminum, and potassium cations and the enrichment in hydroxide and crystal water in glauconites. Gradients in pore-water contents of dissolved phosphate and fluoride at Sites 798 and 799 suggest a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> phosphate <b>precipitation</b> between 30 and 50 mbsf, with fluoride as the limiting element for phosphate precipitation at Site 798. Phosphate and fluoride appear to be balanced at Site 799. Crude extrapolations indicate that the Japan-Sea sediments may have taken up approximately 7. 2 * 10 ** 10 g P total/yr during the Neogene and Pleistocene. This amount corresponds to approximately 0. 3 % of the estimated present-day global transfer of phosphorus into the sediments and suggests that the Japan Sea constitutes an average sink for this element. The two main carriers of phosphorus into the present Japan Sea are the Tshushima and the Liman currents, importing approximately 6. 6 * 10 ** 10 g P and 5. 7 * 10 ** 10 g P per year, respectively. Bulk chemical analyses suggest that at least 36 % of P total in the sediments is organically bound phosphorus. This rather high value, which corresponds to the measured Japan-Sea deep-water P organic/P total ratios, probably reflects rapid transport of organic phosphorus into the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the Japan Sea...|$|R
