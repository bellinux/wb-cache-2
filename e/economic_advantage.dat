5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1895, the University of Montana {{has had a}} major impact on the {{development}} of Missoula's economy. In addition to the <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> from accommodating the student body, it gave the city an educated workforce not available in most of the state. The university has a close relationship with the city as Missoula's largest employer and with the millions of dollars the school brings into the city through visitors of school-sponsored sporting and cultural events. The university also houses Missoula's only business incubator, the Montana Technology Enterprise Center (MonTEC), and several start-up businesses.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{independent}} Apple resellers filed {{a lawsuit}} against Apple alleging the company used misleading advertising practices by using unfair business practices that harmed the resellers' sales while boosting Apple-owned outlets, in effect by favoring its own outlets over those of its resellers. The lawsuit claimed that Apple favored company-owned stores by providing significant discounts unavailable to independent dealers. The complaint alleged Apple's acts in favoring its own stores constituted breach of contract, false advertising, fraud, trade libel, defamation, and intentional interference with prospective <b>economic</b> <b>advantage.</b> , Apple reached settlements with all of the plaintiffs, including the bankruptcy trustee for one reseller that failed, while the former principal of that company appealed the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Texas {{separated}} from Mexico in 1836; Tyler, {{a firm believer}} in manifest destiny, saw its annexation as providing an <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> to the United States, and worked diligently to make it happen. He initially sought election to a full term as president, but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats, he withdrew in support of Democrat James K. Polk, who favored annexation. Polk won the election, and Tyler signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. Under Polk, the process was completed. After the American Civil War began in 1861, Tyler won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death. Although some have praised Tyler's political resolve, his presidency is generally held in low regard by historians. He is considered an obscure president, with little presence in American cultural memory.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and horizontal welding positions, requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{comprehensive}} research project on the economics of pair programming. The purpose of the overall research is to thoroughly examine the <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> pair programming could gain over solo programming, identify situations where pair programming does not have <b>economic</b> <b>advantages,</b> and scenarios where solo programming is more cost effective than pair programming. This paper, due to space limitation, only reports results from one of the several studies we conducted. This paper focuses on one major previous publication, thoroughly examines its methodology and findings, and provides extensions we believe to be more robust and comprehensive. Our analysis results demonstrate pair programming and solo programming both have their own <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> and those advantages are dependent of a variety of factors...|$|R

25|$|Though {{the colonial}} {{boundaries}} sometimes caused internal strife and hardship, some present day leaders {{benefit from the}} desirable borders their former colonial overlords drew. For example, Nigeria's inheritance of an outlet to the sea — and the trading opportunities a port affords — gives the nation a distinct <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> over its neighbor, Niger. Effectively, the early carving of colonial space turned naturally occurring factor endowments into state controlled assets.|$|E
25|$|Construction of Soviet Union-era dams often {{involved}} enforced resettlement of {{huge numbers}} of people, as well as destruction of their historical heritage. For instance, the town of Mologa was flooded {{for the purpose of}} constructing the Rybinsk Reservoir (then the largest artificial lake in the world). The construction of the Uglich Reservoir caused the flooding of several monasteries with buildings dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. In such cases the ecological and cultural damage often outbalanced any <b>economic</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E

Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.|$|E

The technique, still unproven technically, uses a ''green-field'' or build-up approach. Other more mature processes were considered to obtain some baseline assumptions. Based on this analysis, TMI has shown that multi-pass printing can offer substantial <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> over many existing fabrication processes and can reduce costs. By impacting overall production costs, the time is compressed to penetrate early low volume niche markets and more mature high-volume market applications...|$|R

Bell's promised PCC tram began operation in 1950, but remained a one-off, with more W-class trams being built instead, the last entering service in 1956. Risson's reopening of Bourke St trams, with the justification of <b>economic</b> <b>advantage,</b> and is lauded as his greatest achievement. Risson also made use of migration agreements to bolster low employee numbers, even purchasing dwellings to house new arrivals.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{reciprocity}} {{may have been}} utilized by {{one member of the}} community to gain control over others. For instance, if an individual farmer might have had an overly abundant crop one season, that farmer {{might have been able to}} use the excess food to hold a community feast, in which he may have been able to persuade others subconsciously, using the theory of reciprocity, to obtain from them labor or goods that the farmer than may have been able to use to slowly gain an <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> over his peers.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, a {{majority}} of the population spoke German (26,957 or 55.4%) as their first language. French was the second most common (13,695 or 28.1%) and Italian was third (2,925 or 6.0%). There were 37 people who spoke Romansh. The city is officially bilingual (the biggest bilingual city in Switzerland). In addition some 150 nationalities are represented in Biel. In recent years the city has used its linguistic assets as an <b>economic</b> <b>advantage,</b> becoming the Swiss City of Communication. Several call centres have been created in or around Biel, in addition to the traditional businesses established in the city and surrounding area, which have always exported most of their production worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the German {{practice}} of sliding block breeches {{that required a}} metallic cartridge case to seal the gun's chamber against combustion gases, Škoda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel cartridge case when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a monobloc auto-frettaged barrel. This was {{a single piece of}} steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.|$|E
25|$|Proponents, {{such as the}} Minister without Portfolio Moshe Arens, {{advocated}} {{that the}} Lavi was a high prestige program, asserting Israeli technological capabilities and would work to the nation's <b>economic</b> <b>advantage.</b> A failure {{to proceed with the}} development could lead to significant job losses and possibly contribute to emigration; the Israeli State Comptroller argued the resulting unemployment was negligible. Arens was keen to promote potential partnerships and technology exchanges in regards to the Lavi. Perhaps optimistically, IAI had projected export sales of the Lavi to be as many as 407 units to customers including South Africa, Chile, Taiwan, and Argentina; there were reports of significant South African interest and involvement during the early development of the Lavi. In later development, however, Israel had given the U.S. explicit guarantees that the Lavi would not be made available to export.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the {{production}} of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than {{the production}} of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas. When evaluating costs, fossil fuels are generally used as the reference. The energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort and so has no cost assigned to it. Only the extraction, refining, transportation and production costs are considered. On the other hand, the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured, and so has a significant cost, on top of all the costs of refining, transportation, and distribution. Systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly, for example in trolleybuses, or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> because there are fewer conversion processes required between primary energy source and point of use.|$|E
