The Great Elephant Census team is flying over 20 countries to survey the African savannah elephants with hopes that the accurate and up-to-date <b>data</b> <b>will</b> spur immediate protective actions and long-term conservation management plans.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic <b>data</b> <b>will</b> be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational <b>data</b> <b>will</b> be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

The problem is how mm space distance and how breaking velocity will be producting maximum secondary voltage ? In this research used 6 independent variables distance space (0. 1 - 0. 6 mm wth 0. 1 mm interval) and 6 breaking velocity variables (1000 to 6000 rpm with 1000 interval).

5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards <b>Data</b> <b>will</b> deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the <b>data</b> <b>will</b> enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

30|$|The <b>data</b> logger <b>will</b> send {{a command}} to the bio-sensor to set its {{transceiver}} {{at the first}} channel and the <b>data</b> logger <b>will</b> also set its transceiver to the first channel. Then the <b>data</b> logger <b>will</b> send some data-packets to the bio-sensor and log the number of retry required for that channel. This step will be done for all the available channels (in Nordic transceiver, a total of 126 channels starting from 2.4 to 2.526 GHz are available).|$|R

At the i'th data point, the analytical concentrations of the reactants, TA(i), TB(i) etc. will be experimentally known quantities {{and there will be}} one or more measured quantities, yi, that depend in some way on the analytical concentrations and equilibrium constants. A general computational procedure has three main components.|$|E

50|$|Lazy {{evaluation}} is particularly interesting in a purely functional language because {{the order of}} the evaluation never changes the result of a function. Therefore, lazy evaluation naturally becomes {{an important part of the}} construction of purely functional data structures. It allows computation to be done only when its result is actually required. Therefore, the code of a purely functional data structure can, without loss of efficiency, consider similar <b>data</b> which <b>will</b> effectively be used and <b>data</b> which <b>will</b> be ignored. The only computation required is for the first kind of <b>data</b> that <b>will</b> actually be performed.|$|R

25|$|The {{symbolic}} {{closing of}} the gap was celebrated on 9 September 2016. High-speed runs were due to begin on 17 October 2016.

25|$|Optimizing {{the speed}} and {{accuracy}} of these steps for use in large-scale automated structure prediction is {{a key component of}} structural genomics initiatives, partly because the resulting volume of <b>data</b> <b>will</b> be too large to process manually and partly because the goal of structural genomics requires providing models of reasonable quality to researchers who are not themselves structure prediction experts.|$|E

25|$|In many {{situations}} the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and <b>data</b> <b>will</b> {{have to be}} weighted to correctly represent the population. Thus for example, a simple random sample of individuals in the United Kingdom might include some in remote Scottish islands who would be inordinately expensive to sample. A cheaper method would be to use a stratified sample with urban and rural strata. The rural sample could be under-represented in the sample, but weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate.|$|E
25|$|Numerical {{stability}} {{is an important}} notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called numerically stable if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation.
