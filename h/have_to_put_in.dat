500|$|Zubir {{took a year}} {{to finish}} {{composing}} the music and lyrics for the song. In a 1984 oral history interview, he recalled the process: [...] "he difficulty is {{in such a short}} melody, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> all the words.... t must be very simple, understandable for all the races in Singapore....

The singer has described the song as [...] "actually very innocent [...] a little aggressive maybe:" [...] "All I'm saying is don't come around if you're {{not going to live}} up to all your talk and as you know, some guys are just full of talk," [...] Rowland said in a 2008 interview with Popjustice. [...] "It's just a woman saying you can't catch me easy and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the work. It's about putting in work – that's it, of course." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No more, Sir Robert. We {{are paying}} The Cynic thirty guineas to insert this article, {{and the point}} is that they say that if they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the 'national and imperial' {{business}} they must have twenty more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why don't {{they have}} {{the back of the}} wedge wider still? and then it would force the wood open farther; and then you would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a wooden wedge afterwards,--so," [...] he added, making a sign with his fingers. He put {{the tips of his fingers}} together, and then {{separated}} his hands, so as to represent a very blunt-shaped wedge.|$|E
60|$|It {{is not all}} holiday {{here with}} Susie and Clara this time. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> some little time every day on their studies.

6000|$|Wheeler {{filled his}} pipe. [...] "Now," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "anybody {{can apply for}} timber rights, and bid for them at public auction, but the man who secures them must cut up so many {{thousand}} feet every month. Since that's the case, it's quite evident that nobody is likely to bid for timber rights round the valley, except the Charters people, who have a little mill on the Klatchquot Inlet, and they'd probably get the timber rights 'most for nothing, though they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a new saw or two with the object of satisfying the Legislature." ...|$|E

That current is ridiculously under-estimated, and it sets west at this season of the year, remember. Their boats never come south of this, see? So it's no good looking out for them." [...] And {{so on and so}} forth, while Judson lay at length on the locker by the three-pounder, and smoked and absorbed it all.|$|E

Volunteers are exempt, but most men not otherwise accounted for are bagged by the Militia. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a minimum three weeks' camp every other year, and they get fifteen bob a week and their keep when they're at it, and {{some sort of a}} yearly fee, I've forgotten how much. 'Tisn't a showy service, but it's very useful. It keeps the mass of the men between twenty-five, say, and thirty-five moderately fit, and gives the Armity an excuse for having more equipment ready--in case of emergencies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a queer chap, you know," [...] Richard went on. [...] "You {{always seem}} to have {{something}} on but I'm hanged if I can see how you pass your time here in Monte Carlo. This political business, {{even if you do}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a bit of time at it now and then, can't be going on all the while. Monte Carlo, too! So far as the women are concerned, they might as well be {{off the face of the}} earth, and I don't think I've ever seen you make a bet at the tables. How did your wife do last night? I thought she seemed to be dropping it rather." ...|$|E

When he comes to know that, you can always {{put your hands on}} him any time and control him. He's good-natured at heart, and he's the gratefullest mule I've ever seen in the business. He's just got to love you, and hate the other three. And one warning: if he goes real bad and starts biting, you'll have to pull out his teeth and feed him soft mashes and crushed grain that's steamed.

6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose the}} {{authorities}} {{will want to}} keep the prisoners, but of course you will report them on your arrival; and can give them one of the boats, to land across the bay, if they are not wanted. If the governor wants to buy the cargo for the garrison, let him have it, at once. Don't stand out for exorbitant terms, but take a fair price. It is just as well to be on good terms with the authorities. We might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> to refit, and want spars, etc., from the naval yard. If the governor doesn't want the cargo, don't sell it to anyone else till we return. There is no fear of prices going down. The longer we keep it, the more we shall get for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt {{some of the}} {{passengers}} would know that we got on board at Durban, but if any questions were asked we could account for that {{by saying that the}} ship we came over in, was going on to Australia, and therefore we had been obliged to land and take another on to Lorenzo Marques. Once landed, we should of course take a train for Komati-poort, and slip off it after dark at some station a few miles from there. Then, you know, we could first reconnoitre the bridge, and when we had settled on the best place for the dynamite, we could put it there the next night. I know a good deal about the use of dynamite. It is not like gunpowder, that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a hole and fasten up tightly, you only have to lay it upon an iron girder or arch, and light your fuse and leave it to do its work." ...|$|E

He’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> an appearance at some place of worship on Sunday morning, and he can come to us immediately afterwards and have a thorough respite from everything connected with politics. I won’t let him even think of them. I’ve had the picture of Cromwell dissolving the Long Parliament taken down from the staircase, and even the portrait of Lord Rosebery’s ‘Ladas’ removed from the smoking-room. And Vera,” added Mrs. Durmot, turning to her sixteen-year-old niece, “be careful what colour ribbon you wear in your hair; not blue or yellow on any account; those are the rival party colours, and emerald green or orange would be almost as bad, with this Home Rule business to the fore.” ...|$|E
