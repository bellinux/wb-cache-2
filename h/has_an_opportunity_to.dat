5|$|In March 2010, the NFL amended {{its rules}} for postseason overtime, with the rule being {{extended}} into {{the regular season}} in March 2012. If a team scores a touchdown, or if the defense scores a safety on its first possession, it is declared the winner. If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then kicks off to the opposing team, which <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win.|$|E
5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|In many congregations it is {{customary}} to {{call all}} eligible {{members of the}} congregation for an aliyah to the Torah on Simhat Torah. To accommodate this the first five aliyot are reread so that everyone <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> recite the blessing. To save time, some congregations call people up in groups. Others hold a series of separate minyanim for the Torah reading. In a minority of Orthodox congregations women receive aliyot in single-gender tefillah groups (prayer groups consisting only of women, who pray together), and only men are called to the Torah {{in front of the whole}} congregation.|$|E

Above all these is the Partnership Council, to which the Partners elect at least 80 per cent of the 82 representatives, while the chairman appoints the remaining. The councils have the power to discuss ‘any matter whatsoever’, and are responsible for the non-commercial aspects of the business: the development of the social activities within the Partnership and its charitable actions.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{reaches a}} climax when Miao Renfeng challenges Hu Fei to a duel thinking mistakenly that Hu has intentionally molested his daughter, Miao Ruolan. They fight for several rounds but neither emerges the victor. They are stranded on a cliff about to collapse under their weight when the novel ends. Hu Fei <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> attack Miao Renfeng and knock {{him off the}} cliff, but he hesitates because Miao might become his future father-in-law. However, {{if he does not}} attack, either they will fall to their deaths or Miao will kill him. The novel ends on a deliberate cliffhanger and leaves the conclusion to the reader's imagination.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} of osteoclasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) {{is one of}} the best studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors. The role of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but less well understood. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis.|$|E

25|$|The SRP RNA is an {{integral}} part of the small and the large domain of the SRP. The function of the small domain is to delay protein translation until the ribosome-bound SRP <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> associate with the membrane-resident SRP receptor (SR). Within the large domain, the SRP RNA of the signal peptide-charged SRP promotes the hydrolysis of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules. This reaction releases the SRP from the SRP receptor and the ribosome, allowing translation to continue and the protein to enter the translocon. The protein transverses the membrane co-translationally (during translation) and enters into another cellular compartment or the extracellular space. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Archaea, SRP delivers proteins to the plasma membrane. In the bacteria, SRP primarily incorporates proteins into the inner membrane.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
25|$|Established {{inside the}} United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the Panel is tasked with {{evaluating}} {{the conclusion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The Panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the Chief Judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates. If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if they do not concur, the Secretary <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> amend and refile his or her petition. In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the United States Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.|$|E

[...] Charney characterizes {{the problem of the}} book and its subject matter as a [...] "kind of with-it diffuseness which disallows any intelligent understanding on principle". In a review of the book for The New York Times Book Review, Zane Berzins was critical of the work, commenting: [...] "There isn't much to be said for the book except that it exudes a kind of repellent fascination." [...] A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review characterizes it as, [...] "Not a book, really. A verbatim transcription of one of Werner Erhard's weekend sessions in $250 doublethink." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticizes the author for not engaging in any judgmental analysis of the est training methodology. The review concludes, [...] "at least the reader finally <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> see what an estian seminar is, with vomit bags, circuitous logic, pathetic interplay between overbearing trainer and angst-ridden trainee, and all." ...|$|E
500|$|Ties {{have since}} become {{uncommon}} after {{the rules were}} changed in 1974 that added one sudden death overtime period (15 minutes) to regular-season and preseason games if they were tied after regulation. Under the original overtime rules, any score by either team in overtime would win the game, which was proved to grant a substantial advantage to the team that won the coin toss. The rules were then modified in 2012 so that the teams [...] "have the opportunity to possess the ball {{at least once in}} the extra period unless the team that receives the [...] overtime kickoff scores a touchdown on its first possession." [...] The game can also automatically end on a safety or a defensive touchdown. If the team that received the opening kickoff instead scores a field goal, the other team <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> tie or surpass that score; if they are able to tie the score, the next team to score any points wins. The overtime rules were further modified in 2017, shortening the extra period from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games.|$|E
500|$|In the game, {{the player}} uses the {{directional}} pad to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. The {{buttons on the}} controller are used to attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon). Wonder Boy has a life meter shown {{on the top of}} the gameplay area by a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends, but if he has a life potion ("medicine vial" [...] in Dragon's Curse) remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a [...] "continue screen"; there the player <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town. Players can visit the town's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the current player's form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock. Dragon's Curse has a [...] "file cabinet" [...] which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.|$|E

2500|$|The catcher {{can help}} his pitcher get more strike {{calls from the}} umpire by using a {{technique}} called [...] "framing". This practice {{is a matter of}} a catcher keeping his mitt inside the strike zone, or making the pitch appear as close to the strikezone, when receiving the pitch, thereby giving the plate umpire the impression that the pitch is in the strike zone, even if it is not. When framing, a catcher will also hold his mitt still for a second or two so that the umpire <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> thoroughly consider his call (and, hopefully, let his innate biases influence his decision in a direction favorable to the catcher's team).|$|E
