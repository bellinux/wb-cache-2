40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of a currency board, inflation targeting, and dollarization in a small, open developing economy with a liberalized capital account. We focus on the transmission of shocks to currency and country risk premia and on the role of fluctuations in premia in the propagation of other shocks. We calibrate our model on Argentina. The framework matches the second moments of key variables well. Welfare analysis suggests that dollarization is preferable to alternative regimes because it removes currency premium volatility. However, a currency board can match dollarization on welfare grounds if the central bank holds a sufficiently large stock of foreign reserves.

40|$|The {{previous}} currency law of Nov. 22, 1983 imposed many {{restrictions on}} currency transactions, {{making it impossible}} to implement market mechanisms into that sphere of economic activity. Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act. It means that the Act introduces freedom of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transactions in relations indifferent {{from the point of view}} of economic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> interests of the State. Besides, the new law provides for statutory guaranties of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> property rights. However, it also imposes on economic units the duty to resell to the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> banks part of those units' revenues in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The Act introduces also <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> auctions, open for all economic units. The auction price of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> is to be shaped by supply/demand rules. The Act, in an attempt to protect Polish currency, introduces the duty to obtain <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> permit for payments for goods, services and labour if these payments are to be effected in Poland between so-called domestic persons. The permit is necessary also in case of taking Polish currency and Polish securities abroad. A new solution is the provision allowing the retired persons who receive their pensions from foreign insurance companies to collect part of their allowances in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The new Law, although not free from defects, is a step in the right direction.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} effect on firm value of {{different}} <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (FC) financial hedging strategies identified by type of exposure (short or long term) and type of instrument (forwards, options, swaps and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt).

Short term instruments such as FC forwards and/or options are used to hedge short term exposure generated from export activity while FC debt and FC swaps into <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> (but not into domestic currency) are used to hedge long term exposure arising from assets located in foreign locations. Our results relating to the value effects of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> hedging indicate that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives use increases firm value but there is no hedging premium associated with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt hedging, except when combined with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> derivatives.

40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} {{of the currency}} denomination of small business loans. We first model the choice of loan currency in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds come at a lower interest rate, all <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans. When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans, as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> income and assets are more likely to borrow in a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R

The external value of the local currency is counter-cyclical, so that <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> debt requires larger repayments than local currency debt in bad states of nature. The level of foreign currency-denominated debts, therefore, affects the volatility of aggregate demand and by extension of the exchange rate.

Finally, this risk premium is {{a major factor in the}} choice of local versus <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> for emerging market borrowers.
