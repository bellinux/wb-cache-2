5|$|On {{the second}} afternoon, Bradman delayed {{the taking of}} the second new ball until after tea so that Lindwall and Johnston could have an extra period of {{recuperation}} before a new attack. This proved dividends as the bowlers took a wicket apiece within three overs of the new ball being taken, leaving England at 6/134. England were bowled out for 215 on the third morning, as Lindwall took 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that <b>he</b> <b>pretended</b> not to notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall was {{subjected}} to a thorough fitness test {{on the morning of}} the Second Test at Lord's two weeks later, the home of cricket. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Lindwall contributed 15 to Australia's total of 350. He then took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. He had Washbrook caught behind in his fourth over and then clean bowled Edrich and Tom Dollery in the space of three balls. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control. He later returned to bowl English captain Norman Yardley after an 87 run stand with Compton, before finishing with 5/70 as Australia took a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall then contributed 25 as Australia declared at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world-record 596 for victory. Lindwall removed Hutton with the new ball and later returned to remove Dollery and Jim Laker without the addition of a single run to take 3/61 as Australia took a 409 run victory. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that <b>he</b> <b>pretended</b> not to notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser inside-edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that <b>he</b> <b>pretended</b> {{not to notice}} Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax. The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings. Barnes survived a missed stumping {{opportunity}} when he was 18 and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122. Morris was then bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket. Barnes started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Once he reached his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, included two successive blows over the boundary for six. He was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary from Yardley. He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296/2 after 277 minutes when he departed. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's hat-trick ball. Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich at slip. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 and Australia reached stumps at 343, without further loss, with Miller having struck one six into the grandstand.|$|E

25|$|In 1623, Abbas {{decided to}} take back Mesopotamia, which had been lost by his {{grandfather}} Tahmasp through the Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555). Profiting from the confusion surrounding the accession of the new Ottoman sultan Murad IV, <b>he</b> <b>pretended</b> {{to be making a}} pilgrimage to the Shi'ite shrines of Kerbala and Najaf, but used his army to seize Baghdad. However, Abbas was then distracted by a rebellion in Georgia in 1624 led by Giorgi Saakadze thus allowing an Ottoman force to besiege Baghdad, but the Shah came to its relief the next year and crushed the Turkish army decisively. In 1638, however, after Abbas' death, the Ottomans retook Baghdad and the Iranian–Ottoman border was finalised to be roughly the same as the current Iran - Turkey and Iran - Iraq borders.|$|E
25|$|Pan Jun, {{having heard}} of Lü Yi's abuses of power, sought {{permission}} {{to leave his}} position {{and return to the}} imperial capital, Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), for an audience with the emperor Sun Quan. Upon returning to Jianye, he learnt that Sun Deng, the Crown Prince, had already spoken up numerous times about Lü Yi's behaviour, but Sun Quan refused to listen to him. Many other officials, fearing that they would offend Lü Yi by speaking up, remained silent. Pan Jun decided to take matters into his own hands. <b>He</b> <b>pretended</b> to host a banquet, invited all his colleagues to attend, and hoped to use the opportunity to assassinate Lü Yi. However, Lü Yi secretly found out that Pan Jun wanted to kill him, so he lied that he was sick and did not show up.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{held the}} hills {{to the west}} of Carthage and the only bridge across the Bagradas river leading to Utica.

Hamilcar aimed to attack the small rebel band holding the bridge, but Spendius led the rebel force besieging Utica to confront Hamilcar. The Carthaginian army was caught in a pincer movement, <b>he</b> <b>pretended</b> to retreat, and when the rebel formation became disordered, Hamilcar, by brilliant maneuvering, heavily defeated their forces, killing 8,000 mercenaries and capturing 2,000 men. Hamilcar occupied the bridge, then established control over the surrounding region while part of the surviving rebels fled towards Utica and others, after being driven from their camp near the bridge, fled to Tunis.|$|E
