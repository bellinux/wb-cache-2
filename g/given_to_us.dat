5|$|The {{original}} foundation {{ancestors of}} the Colorado Ranger were two stallions brought to the United States and <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> president Ulysses S. Grant by the Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1878. The first horse was a gray Barb named Linden Tree, foaled in 1874. The second was a desertbred Arabian, also gray, named Leopard, foaled in 1873. The two stallions reached Virginia in 1879, after their voyage from Turkey. Upon reaching Virginia, they spent 14 years in the breeding herds of Randolph Huntington, a noted breeder of trotting and roadster horses. In 1896, Randolph leased Leopard and Linden Tree {{to a friend of}} Grant's, named General Colby, who used to stallions to breed a number of mares on his ranch in Nebraska. These breedings were successful at producing high-quality ranch horses, and a few years later several ranches in Colorado collaborated to buy a group of horses, including one stallion, from the Colby Ranch. All of the mares were sired by one of the two imported sires, and the stallion, a few-spot leopard Appaloosa, was a grandson of Leopard on both sides of his pedigree. The influence of Linden Tree and Leopard on American horse breeding was such that they are now listed in the studbooks for the Arabian Horse Association and the Jockey Club (which registers Thoroughbreds), both major breed associations in the United States.|$|E

25|$|War on Terror: Although R's {{contribution}} to the War on Terror is highly classified, the organisation gained some attention in the Western media after claims that it was assisting the United States by providing intelligence on Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban's whereabouts. Maps and photographs of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan along with other evidence implicating Osama bin Laden in terrorist attacks were <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> intelligence officials. RAW's role in the War on Terror may increase as US intelligence has indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence. It has further come to light that a timely tip-off by RAW helped foil a third assassination plot against Pakistan's former President, General Pervez Musharraf.|$|E

When it comes to obtaining the solutions of these equations, there are many various techniques in the literature. Some of these <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> approximate solutions; others <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> analytical solutions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{consideration}} of the N-body gravitational problem equations can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> some class of boundary-value problems defined on the ”beem’s” construction. One can considere it as weak or so-called finite element method’s approximation with the linear function’s basis. So there are time and coordinate dependent beems as distances between points and unknown coordinate functions which are defined on the beems. The possible sample from this class is simple Lalplas equation where potential energy are maximal. Some computer simulations can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> symmetries on spherical coordinates (similar for well known mathematical structures- configurations like Pascal or Desargus configurations). But in other hand, the {{consideration of}} the natural mass distribution can <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> evidence of the physical reality of the similar structures on the star sphere. Moreover, there are coupled invariancy for geometry and arithmetics. 51 P 05, 85 -XX Key words: N-body problem, finite elements, natural symmetries, configuration...|$|R

The ACSA club operates a bar, bowling alley, swimming pool, restaurant, video-rentals club, indoor gym and a beauty parlour within the embassy premises. Tax-free import clearances <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> diplomats and consular officials for importing food, alcohol and other domestic items were revoked with immediate effect. U.S. embassy vehicles and staff are no longer immune from penalties for traffic violations. American diplomats were asked to show work contracts of all domestic help (cooks, gardeners, drivers and security staff) employed within their households. Indian authorities also conducted {{an investigation into the}} American Embassy School.|$|E

500|$|The coup had {{broad support}} among U.S. politicians. Historian Piero Gleijeses {{writes that the}} foreign policy of both Republican and Democratic parties {{expressed}} an intransigent assertion of U.S. hegemony over Central America, making them predisposed to seeing communist threats where none existed. Thus Eisenhower's continuation of the Monroe Doctrine had continued bipartisan support. The coup met with strong negative reactions in Latin America; a wave of anti-United States protests followed the overthrow of Árbenz. These sentiments persisted for several decades afterwards; historians have pointed to the coup {{as a reason for}} the hostile reception <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>U.S.</b> Vice President Richard Nixon when he visited Latin America four years later. A State Department study found that negative public reactions to the coup had occurred in eleven Latin American countries, including a few that were otherwise pro-American. Historian John Lewis Gaddis states that knowledge of the CIA's role in coups in Iran and Guatemala gave the agency [...] "an almost mythic reputation throughout Latin America and the Middle East as an instrument with which the United States could depose governments it disliked, whenever it wished to do so".|$|E
