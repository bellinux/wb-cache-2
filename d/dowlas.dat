25|$|Owing to Siraj ud <b>Dowla’s</b> {{harshness}} of {{temper and}} indulgence, fear and terror had {{settled on the}} hearts of everyone {{to such an extent}} that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Among his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud <b>Dowla</b> despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud <b>Dowla</b> treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraj ud <b>Dowla</b> uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence.|$|R

"If Master <b>Dowlas</b> {{wants to}} know the truth on it," [...] said Mr. Macey, with a sarcastic smile, tapping his thumbs together, [...] "he's no call to lay any bet--let him go and stan' by himself--there's nobody 'ull hinder him; and then he can let the parish'ners know if they're wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|By the landlord's intervention, {{however, the}} dispute was accommodated. Mr. <b>Dowlas</b> consented {{to go as}} a second person disinclined to act officially; and so poor Silas, {{furnished}} with some old coverings, turned out with his two companions into the rain again, thinking of the long night-hours before him, not as those do who long to rest, but as those who expect to [...] "watch for the morning".|$|E

6000|$|There {{was a hot}} debate upon this, the farrier {{being of}} course indisposed to renounce the quality of doctor, but contending that a doctor could be a constable if he liked--the law meant, he needn't be one if he didn't like. Mr. Macey thought this was nonsense, since the law was {{not likely to be}} fonder of doctors than of other folks. Moreover, if it was in the nature of doctors more than of other men not to like being constables, how came Mr. <b>Dowlas</b> to be so eager to act in that capacity? ...|$|E
6000|$|He had {{a strong}} common sense, like that which Rose Flammock, the weaver's daughter, in Scott's romance, commends in her father, as {{resembling}} a yardstick, which, whilst it measures <b>dowlas</b> and diaper, can equally well measure tapestry and cloth of gold. He had always a new resource. When I was planting forest-trees, and had procured half a peck of acorns, he said {{that only a small}} portion of them would be sound, and proceeded to examine them, and select the sound ones. But finding this took time, he said, [...] "I think, if you put them all into water, the good ones will sink;" [...] which experiment we tried with success. He could plan a garden, or a house, or a barn; would have been competent to lead a [...] "Pacific Exploring Expedition"; could give judicious counsel in the gravest private or public affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, but there's this in it, Dowlas," [...] {{said the}} landlord, {{speaking}} {{in a tone of}} much candour and tolerance. [...] "There's folks, i' my opinion, they can't see ghos'es, not if they stood as plain as a pike-staff before 'em. And there's reason i' that. For there's my wife, now, can't smell, not if she'd the strongest o' cheese under her nose. I never see'd a ghost myself; but then I says to myself, [...] "Very like I haven't got the smell for 'em." [...] I mean, putting a ghost for a smell, or else contrairiways. And so, I'm for holding with both sides; for, as I say, the truth lies between 'em. And if <b>Dowlas</b> was to go and stand, and say he'd never seen a wink o' Cliff's Holiday all the night through, I'd back him; and if anybody said as Cliff's Holiday was certain sure, for all that, I'd back him too. For the smell's what I go by." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{the ladies}} were enjoying the {{negative}} luxury of being liberated from a ship, at the Fountain Inn, I strolled about the place. You know that I had twice visited England professionally before I was eighteen; and, on one occasion, the ship I was in anchored off this very island, though {{not at this}} precise spot. I now thought the people altered. There had certainly been so many important changes in myself during the same period, that it becomes me to speak with hesitation on this point: but even the common class seemed less peculiar, less English, less provincial, if one might use such an expression, as applied to so great a nation; in short, more {{like the rest of}} the world than formerly. Twenty years before, England was engaged in a war, by which she was, in a degree, isolated from most of Christendom. This insulated condition, sustained by a consciousness of wealth, knowledge, and power, had served to produce a decided peculiarity of manners, and even of appearance. In the article of dress I could not be mistaken. In 1806 I had seen all the lower classes of the English clad in something like costumes. The Channel waterman wore the short <b>dowlas</b> petticoat; the Thames waterman, a jacket and breeches of velveteen, and a badge; the gentleman and gentlewoman, attire such as was certainly to be seen in no other part of the Christian world, the English colonies excepted. Something of this still remained, but it existed rather as the exception than as the rule. I then felt, at every turn, that I was in a foreign country; whereas, now, the idea did not obtrude itself, unless I was brought in immediate contact with the people.|$|E
