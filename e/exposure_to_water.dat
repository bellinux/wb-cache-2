Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

500|$|In situ {{investigations}} {{have been performed}} on Mars by the Viking landers, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, Phoenix lander, and Curiosity rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living organisms ever existed there remains unknown. The Viking probes of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of CO2 production on <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of extremophile forms of life, {{has suggested that the}} Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form. Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has a alkaline pH and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.

2500|$|Humans usually become {{infected}} after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely {{in the morning}} and on sunny days, and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch [...] "hotspots". Children may {{become infected}} more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on plant oils.|$|E

40|$|In fish, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>waters</b> of low pH causes {{significant}} {{damage to the}} gill resulting in fatal iono- and osmoregulatory disturbance. In amphibians, <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> acid <b>waters</b> also disrupts ionic homeostasis, however the extent and nature of injuries to amphibian larvae from acid exposure are poorly understood. Changes in gross morphology and ultrastructure of the gills and integument were examined, together with measures of Na(+) efflux/uptake, in larval Litoria fallax (Amphibia: Anura) following acute acid exposure. Examination of tissues revealed significant changes in morphology and ultrastructure of both gills and the integument following acutely lethal <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> low pH <b>water.</b> Changes <b>to</b> the gills of acid-exposed L fallax larvae included lifting of the branchial epithelium and opening of tight junctions between pavement cells (with a consequent reduction in tight function length). Damage to epithelial cell-cell tight functions was also apparent at the integument along with widespread oncosis and localised epithelial necrosis. Mucous secretory activity at the gills and body surface was largely unaffected by acid exposure, {{with little or no}} difference in density, cross-sectional area and number of epithelial mucous secretory vesicles in acid-exposed and control larvae. Changes in morphology and ultrastructure at low pH were accompanied by significant Na(+) loss (up to 50 % of the total body Na(+) content) attributable in large part to increased paracellular ionic efflux across the gills as well as increased transcellular and paracellular efflux of ions across the integument.
