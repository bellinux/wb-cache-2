Situated on a [...] site, the EMD London facility included two main buildings and multiple ancillary buildings with over [...] of office and manufacturing space, {{as well as a}} locomotive test track. London was the primary site for the assembly, painting and testing of EMD locomotives. The facility also manufactured components, such as locomotive underframes, traction motors, truck assemblies, and locomotive <b>equipment</b> <b>racks.</b> EMD London was ISO 9001:2000 Certified for Quality and ISO 14001 Certified for Environmental Management.

2500|$|In {{television}} stations, recording studios, {{and other}} installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground {{known as a}} [...] "technical ground" [...] (or [...] "technical earth", [...] "special earth", and [...] "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent ground loops. This is basically {{the same thing as}} an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio. In most cases, the studio's metal <b>equipment</b> <b>racks</b> are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or busbars) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.|$|E
