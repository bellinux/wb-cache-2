5|$|At {{the start}} of loading, the coal would run into a {{suspended}} anti-breakage box, which was <b>hydraulically</b> lowered into the hold and emptied through a hinged flap at the bottom.|$|E
5|$|The later Firebrand T.F. Mk 5 {{featured}} minor aerodynamic {{improvements and}} 123 were converted from Mk IVs. The final version was the Firebrand T.F. Mk 5A with <b>hydraulically</b> boosted ailerons {{to increase the}} aircraft's rate of roll. Two Mk 5s and five Mk IVs were converted to the Mk 5A standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighborhoods that}} make up West Seattle are on a {{peninsula}} separated from downtown by the Duwamish River. The West Seattle Bridge is the primary roadway crossing the river. The neighborhood's Spokane Street Bridge is the world's first and only <b>hydraulically</b> operated concrete double-leaf swing bridge.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} engine's output, the MEC {{operates}} five <b>hydraulically</b> actuated propellant valves on each engine; the oxidizer preburner oxidizer, fuel preburner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant valves. In an emergency, the valves can be fully closed {{by using the}} engine's helium supply system as a backup actuation system.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that <b>hydraulically</b> opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was <b>hydraulically</b> operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the <b>hydraulically</b> powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
5|$|The temple complex {{has a large}} <b>hydraulically</b> {{operated}} bell, which tolls with a {{high pitch}} at frequent intervals. Wood and stone carvings are profusely seen in the temple. In front of each deity there is a cushion, impressive scrolls, and candles set in very attractive suspended lamps, and {{with a large number}} of priests in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two <b>hydraulically</b> powered {{twin gun}} turrets, {{designated}} 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated <b>hydraulically.</b> In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{just below}} Northwich, the Anderton Boat Lift {{is now the}} normal route for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, a Trust was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more <b>hydraulically</b> powered. The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were <b>hydraulically</b> actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to <b>hydraulically</b> fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and <b>hydraulically</b> damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. <b>Hydraulically</b> actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The <b>hydraulically</b> rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight deck}} is fitted with {{conventional}} dual yoke control columns. Flight control surfaces are <b>hydraulically</b> operated.|$|E
25|$|Replaced the AI.17 radar with U.S.-made Westinghouse AN/APQ-43 radar (known as the AI.22 in RAF service), <b>hydraulically</b> {{operated}} tail; 30 produced.|$|E
25|$|Landing gear {{retraction}} was <b>hydraulically</b> {{powered by}} an engine driven pump, or with emergency extension by gravity and a manually operated hand pump in the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The {{sliding sleeve}} is <b>hydraulically</b> or {{mechanically}} actuated to allow {{communication between the}} tubing and the 'A' annulus. They are often used in multiple reservoir wells to regulate flow {{to and from the}} zones.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{direct or}} {{indirect}} extrusion presses are <b>hydraulically</b> driven, {{but there are some}} small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses there are two types: direct-drive oil presses and accumulator water drives.|$|E
25|$|The {{cab roof}} is {{reinforced}} {{to take the}} weight of two personnel and has a roof hatch and provision for a machine gun installation over an observer's platform inside the cab. For maintenance the cab can be <b>hydraulically</b> tilted forward 50°.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydraulically</b> {{operated}} main-wheel {{units were}} {{similar to those of the}} Lancaster, had single Dunlop wheels and retracted rearward into the inboard engine nacelles. The twin tailwheels retracted rearward into the fuselage and were enclosed by twin longitudinal doors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydraulically</b> driven. An SAU-1T-2 {{automatic}} {{flight control}} system offers assisted manual or automatic flight, with no manual option. Four independent hydraulic systems power all flight controls and the built-in airstairs. Fluid is to the NGZh, rather than AMG, formula.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 Chris Phoenix informally {{outlined}} a {{design for a}} <b>hydraulically</b> powered replicator a few cubic feet in volume that used ultraviolet light to cure soft plastic feedstock and a fluidic logic control system, but didn't address most {{of the details of}} assembly procedures, error rates, or machining tolerances.|$|E
25|$|C-23A Sherpa: Twin-engine {{transport}} aircraft for the U.S. Air Force {{based on the}} Short 330-UTT; it was fitted with a strengthened cabin floor with a roller conveyor system, plus a forward cargo door {{on the port side}} of the fuselage, equipped with a <b>hydraulically</b> operated full-width rear cargo door/ramp; 18 built.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} was the 4-speed gearbox {{from the}} 6C 2300, mounted with a Hardy disc behind the engine. originally standard fitted which they removed and installed {{in its place}} a differential unit from a Lancia Lambda. A unique system pre-selector gear change system was also developed. The clutch was <b>hydraulically</b> assisted.|$|E
25|$|The main landing gear, {{housed in}} the {{nacelles}} behind the engines, were raised and lowered <b>hydraulically.</b> The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was also retractable.|$|E
25|$|TNT {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in <b>hydraulically</b> induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.|$|E
25|$|The {{tail fin}} is of wood {{construction}} and features a NACA 0012 symmetrical airfoil. The {{main landing gear}} legs are made from fibreglass laminates and mount wheels with <b>hydraulically</b> operated toe-brakes. The nose wheel is of a fully castering design and can rotate 360°, allowing the aircraft to be pushed backwards while ground handling.|$|E
25|$|The DIRAVI {{steering}} is self-centering {{and fully}} powered (as opposed to <b>hydraulically</b> assisted). This feature allows {{the front wheels}} to run near-zero caster, and {{means that there is}} no camber change as lock is applied, and also ensures that the maximum amount of tyre area is in contact with the road at all times.|$|E
25|$|IMR (Ob'yekt 616) (IMR {{stands for}} Inzhenernaya Mashina Razgrazhdeniya) - T-55 {{converted}} into a combat engineer vehicle. The turret was replaced with a <b>hydraulically</b> operated crane with capacity of 2 tonnes, capable of 360° turn. The crane is operated from an armoured cupola with a visor can also be fitted with a small bucket and used as excavator arm or a pair of pincer type grabs for removing obstacles like trees. Its jib is telescopic and when in traveling position it is folded down and placed on a cradle {{in the rear of}} the hull which is folded down against the engine deck when the crane is in use. A <b>hydraulically</b> operated dozer blade is mounted to the front of the hull; it can be used in a straight or V-configuration only. The vehicle is fitted with a searchlight. The IMR was developed in 1969 and entered service five years later.|$|E
25|$|The Plio-Pleistocene Wouri {{alluvial}} aquifer, a multi-layer {{system with}} alternating sequences of marine sands and estuarine mud and silt lies below the estuary and surrounding region {{and is an}} important source of well water. The upper aquifer in this system is an unconfined sandy horizon that is <b>hydraulically</b> connected to the brackish waters of the estuary and to the coastal wetlands.|$|E
25|$|Shale {{gas in the}} United Kingdom has {{attracted}} increasing attention since 2007, following the large-scale production of natural gas from shales in the US and Canada. A number of wells have been drilled and a single shale gas well has been <b>hydraulically</b> fractured, but as of August 2016, there has, as yet, been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK.|$|E
25|$|After sorting or {{screening}} {{to remove}} any physical contaminants from the feedstock, the material is often shredded, minced, and mechanically or <b>hydraulically</b> pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and, hence, increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids {{can be achieved by}} using a chopper pump to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester, where anaerobic treatment takes place.|$|E
25|$|The P-38J-25-LO {{production}} block {{also introduced}} <b>hydraulically</b> boosted ailerons, {{one of the}} first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.|$|E
