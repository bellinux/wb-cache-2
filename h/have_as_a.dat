5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

25|$|Haredi {{and much}} of Modern Orthodox Judaism has a blanket {{prohibition}} on women leading public congregational prayers. Conservative Judaism has developed a blanket justification for women leading all or virtually all such prayers, holding that although only obligated individuals can lead prayers and women were not traditionally obligated, Conservative Jewish women in modern times <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> collective whole voluntarily undertaken such an obligation. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations permit women to perform all prayer roles {{because they do not}} regard halakha as binding.|$|E
25|$|Cham Albanians {{claim the}} {{returning}} of the Greek citizenship, {{as a first}} phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams {{as an excuse for}} their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged only a minority of Chams for alleged crimes. They have asked the Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece {{in the case of the}} Greek minority in Albania.|$|E
25|$|Adventitious {{ideas are}} those {{concepts}} that we gain through sense experiences, ideas {{such as the}} sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away.

Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas we <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.|$|E

25|$|Dragan Crnogorac - on 15 November 2010, Crnogorac was {{deprived}} of liberty in Banja Luka {{by order of}} the Prosecutor of the Special Department for War Crimes within the BiH Prosecutor's Office and is suspected to <b>have,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of the police forces of the Jahorina Training Center – {{a part of the}} RS MoI, personally participated in the capture of Muslim men in the village of Sendici who had tried to escape Srebrenica and their execution, during the genocide of July 1995. Crnogorac struck a plea bargain after being indicted for genocide, after which he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Pollution from {{agricultural}} runoff and overtaxing {{of water}} resources is a prevailing issue in the Salmon Falls Creek watershed. With heavy groundwater withdrawal, many of the springs feeding the lower Salmon Falls Creek have decreased in volume. Because the -high Salmon Falls Dam has not released any water (except for that needed for irrigation) since the floods of 1984, the lower creek depends almost entirely on irrigation runoff drainage to sustain its flow. Pollutants in the runoff <b>have,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, hurt the vegetation corridor in the lower canyon. Several tributaries flowing from northern Nevada into southern Idaho have been diverted, leaving even less water to replenish the lower creek.|$|E

25|$|The Commission would <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{mandate to}} clarify {{practices}} which constitute serious human rights, collective responsibilities for these practices, {{the social and}} human impact of the conflict on society and different groups, {{the impact of the}} conflict on politics and democracy, the historical context of the conflict with its multiple causes and the factors and conditions which contributed to the persistence of the conflict. To do so, the Commission would investigate all the aforementioned elements, hold public hearings, present a final report, diffuse its work, ensure the gender mainstreaming throughout its work and be periodically accountable. The government and the FARC have committed to contribute to the clarification of the truth and to recognize their respective responsibilities before the Commission.|$|E
25|$|Property {{prices have}} {{continued}} to rise steeply since {{the early years of}} the 21st century as property developers have moved to cash in on the area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries <b>have,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.|$|E
25|$|In the Western world, {{polygamy}} {{has long}} been associated with Islam; the idea of Islam as – to quote Professor Akbar S. Ahmed – some sort of 'man's paradise', with every man possessing at least four wives, remains a powerful one. However, in traditionally multi-confessional India, polygamy is actually more widespread amongst other religious communities: the 1961 census found {{that the incidence of}} polygamy was the least amongst Muslims (5.7%), with Hindus (5.8%), Jains (6.7%), Buddhists (7.9%) and Adivasis (15.25%) all more likely have a minimum of two wives. Similarly, India's third National Family Health Survey (2006) found that a number of socioeconomic reasons were more likely to explain the prevalence of polygamy than the religion of the parties involved. This survey also found that a polygamous Hindu was likely to <b>have</b> (<b>as</b> <b>a</b> statistical average) 1.77 wives; a Christian, 2.35; a Muslim, 2.55; and a Buddhist, 3.41.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} forms of headgear, in the Commonwealth, {{academic}} caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried. In some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to women, who do wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends {{in a number of}} universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland which <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> common theme that idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. This story is told at the University of Cambridge, Durham University, the University of Bristol, the University of St Andrews and Trinity College, Dublin among others. Indeed Newcastle University shares a similar legend as to why undergraduate academic dress do not contain a mortarboard; it is stated that the first cohort of independent Newcastle graduates from Durham University threw their hats into the River Tyne.|$|E
25|$|The Tohono O’odham, still {{referred}} to as the Pápago by Spanish speakers, have inhabited the most arid areas of the state, and are mostly found in Caborca, Puerto Peñasco, Sáric, Altar and Plutarco Elías Calles in the north of the state. However, most people of this ethnicity now live in neighboring Arizona. The Tohono O’odham <b>have</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> principle deity the “Older Brother,” who dominates the forces of nature. Among their most important rituals is one called the Vikita, which occurs in July, with dances and song to encourage rainfall during the area’s short rainy season. In July, during the full moon, a dance called the Cu-cu is performed, which is to ask for favors from Mother Nature so {{that there will be no}} drought and the later harvests will be abundant. The dance is performed during a large festival with brings together not only the Tohono O’odham from Sonora, but from Arizona and California as well. The feast day of Francis of Assisi is also important. Many of these people are known as skilled carpenters, making furniture as well as delicate figures of wood. There are also craftspeople who make ceramics and baskets, especially a type of basket called a “corita.”.|$|E
