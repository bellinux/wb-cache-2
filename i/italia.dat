5|$|In September 1943, Italy capitulated {{and signed}} an Armistice with the Allies. Littorio was then renamed <b>Italia.</b> The three active battleships were {{transferred}} to Malta before {{they were to be}} interned in Alexandria. While en route to Malta, German bombers attacked the fleet with Fritz X radio-guided bombs, damaging <b>Italia</b> and sinking Roma. Nevertheless, <b>Italia</b> and Vittorio Veneto reached Malta and were interned. The incomplete Impero was seized by the Germans after Italy withdrew from the war and used as a target, until she was sunk by American bombers in 1945. <b>Italia</b> and Vittorio Veneto were awarded to the United States and Britain, respectively, as war prizes. <b>Italia,</b> Vittorio Veneto, and Impero were broken up for scrap between 1952 and 1954.|$|E

One of her 5.9in guns, six of the 57mm guns, and eight of the 37mm revolver cannon were removed. After returning to service in 1909, she served as a torpedo training ship; she served in this capacity through 1910. At {{the start of the}} Italo-Turkish War of 191112, <b>Italia</b> was assigned to the 5th Division of the Italian fleet, along with her sister Lepanto and Enrico Dandolo. In December 1911, <b>Italia</b> and Lepanto were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two ships were sent in large part because the Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17in shells.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after her}} commissioning, Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on 11 November 1940, which put {{her out of}} action until the {{following}} March. Littorio thereafter took part in several sorties to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet, most of which failed to result in any action, the notable exception being the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, where she damaged several British warships. Littorio was renamed <b>Italia</b> in July 1943 {{after the fall of}} the Fascist government. On 9 September 1943, the Italian fleet was attacked by German bombers while it was on its way to internment. During this action, which saw the destruction of her sister , <b>Italia</b> herself was hit by a Fritz X radio-controlled bomb, causing significant damage to her bow. As part of the armistice agreement, <b>Italia</b> was interned at Malta, Alexandria, and finally in the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, where she remained until 1947. <b>Italia</b> was awarded to the United States as a war prize and scrapped at La Spezia in 195254.|$|E

5|$|Despite serving {{for over}} thirty years, the ships had uneventful careers.

Lepanto was converted into a training ship in 1902 and <b>Italia</b> was significantly modernized in 190508 before also becoming a training ship. They briefly saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops defending Tripoli.

5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was only enough for emergencies.

She was renamed <b>Italia</b> on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, <b>Italia</b> and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit <b>Italia</b> just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage.
