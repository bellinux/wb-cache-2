500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one <b>decorative</b> <b>initial</b> per page. Produced by chromolithography, each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed brown leather made to imitate carved wood. A little earlier {{there had been a}} compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the [...] "ivy-mantled tower" [...] in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator leans on a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British Museum (see below).|$|E

Marginal notes reference variant translations and cross references to other Bible passages. Each chapter is headed by a précis of contents. There are <b>decorative</b> <b>initial</b> letters for each Chapter, and a decorated headpiece to each Biblical Book, but no illustrations in the text.|$|E
50|$|The {{editio princeps}} of the Etymologicum Magnum was {{published}} by Zacharias Kallierges and Nikolaos Vlastos under the patronage of Anna Notaras at Venice in 1499. The type face was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The <b>decorative</b> <b>initial</b> letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.|$|E

50|$|This {{illuminated}} script of a song, Candle in the Wind, {{written and}} popularized by Elton John. It was painted after the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 {{at which the}} song was sung by its composer. It features a classically illuminated first letter with a gold border and scroll text title. Heraldic roses, approximately 18, decorate and tumble around the relatively 'large' illuminated and highly <b>decorative</b> <b>initial</b> letter G; note the white burning candle in {{the centre of the}} G. A very fine line border in gold leaf, decorative at two of the corners, surrounds the whole illumination and text.|$|E
5000|$|The Cyrillic {{alphabet}} {{was very}} well suited for the writing of Old Church Slavic, generally following a principle of [...] "one letter for one significant sound", with some arbitrary or phonotactically-based exceptions. Particularly, this principle is violated by certain vowel letters, which represent [...] plus the vowel {{if they are not}} preceded by a consonant. It is also violated by a significant failure to distinguish between /ji/ and /jĭ/ orthographically. There was no distinction of capital and lowercase letters, though manuscript letters were rendered larger for emphasis, or in various <b>decorative</b> <b>initial</b> and nameplate forms. Letters served as numerals as well as phonetic signs; the values of the numerals were directly borrowed from their Greek-letter analogues. Letters without Greek equivalents mostly had no numeral values, whereas one letter, koppa, had only a numeric value with no phonetic value.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{editions of}} the Elegy have {{contained}} illustrations, some of considerable merit, such as those among the Designs by Mr. Bentley, for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray (1753). But the work of two leading artists is particularly noteworthy. Between 1777-8 William Blake was commissioned by John Flaxman to produce an illustrated set of Gray’s poems as a birthday gift to his wife. These were in watercolour and included twelve for the Elegy, which appeared {{at the end of}} the volume. Another individual book was created in 1910 by the illuminator Sidney Farnsworth, hand written in italic script with a mediaeval decorative surround and more modern-looking inset illustrations.
