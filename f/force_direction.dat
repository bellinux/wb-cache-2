500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the <b>force,</b> <b>direction,</b> speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E

5000|$|Humans {{and animals}} often operate using fuzzy {{evaluations}} in many everyday situations.

5000|$|Another {{aspect to}} be considered, is the {{possibility}} to influence the force line of action, by altering the cantilever configuration.The modification of the cantilever configuration will change {{the direction of the}} line of action of the resultant force. Depending on the desired <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> it is possible to add helices, or develop cantilevers with utility shape. As a general rule the line of action of the force will be perpendicular to the structural axis of the wire when activated. Using different configurations a certain variation is, as seen above, possible. In the case of the curvature the activated wire will approximate the straight wire and therefore have a tendency to [...] "curl" [...] up shorten during deactivation.

This technique exposes internal forces, making them external, therefore allowing analysis. This technique is often used several times, iteratively to peel back forces acting on a physical body. For example, a gymnast performing the iron cross: analyzing the ropes and the person lets you know the total force (body weight, neglecting rope weight, breezes, buoyancy, electrostatics, relativity, rotation of the earth, etc..). Then cut the person out and only show one rope. You get <b>force</b> <b>direction.</b> Then only look at the person, now you can get hand forces. Now only look at the arm to get the shoulder forces and moments, and on and on until the component you intend to analyze is exposed.|$|E
30|$|Wettability can {{be defined}} as the {{preference}} of one fluid to adsorb or spread on a solid surface in the presence of another immiscible fluid. In the case of fractured carbonate reservoirs, any alteration of wettability toward more water-wet state changes capillary <b>forces</b> <b>direction</b> so that spontaneous imbibition of water can occur. Therefore, in these reservoirs wettability alteration improves oil recovery. In the case of non-fractured carbonate reservoirs, Owens and Archer (1971) based on contact angle measurements showed that changing wettability from oil-wet to more neutral wet or water-wet state improves oil recovery significantly.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of a large close-packed colloidal crystal with the fcc structure was observed during the sedimentation of colloidal particles in an inverted pyramidal pit [S. Matsuo et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 82, 4285 (2003) ]. Carrying out Brownian dynamics simulations, we confirmed that large grains with the fcc structure are formed when the apex angle of the inverted pyramidal container is suitable and the <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> {{is parallel to the}} the center axis [Y. Kanatsu and M. Sato, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 84, 044601 (2015) ]. To form a high-quality colloidal crystal without defects, it is important to investigate in detail how the quality of a colloidal crystal is affected by the <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> and container shape. In this paper, we focus on the effect of the <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> on crystal quality and investigate how the ratio of the number of the hcp structured particles, Nhcp, to that of fcc structured particles, Nfcc, is affected by the <b>force</b> <b>direction.</b> In our simulation, the ratio of Nfcc to Nhcp is hardly changed when the <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> deviates from the central axis: Nfcc is much larger than Nhcp irrespective of the <b>force</b> <b>direction.</b> Thus, our results show that the crystal structure is insensitive to the <b>force</b> <b>direction</b> in forming a colloidal crystal by sedimentation in an inverted pyramidal container. © 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.
