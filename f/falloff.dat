5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic <b>falloff,</b> known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E

While network growth can rely on a family of metrics, we propose a computationally efficient version based on feature time evolution and demonstrate its potency in determining feature importance and a networks' effective capacity. We demonstrate how automatically expanded architectures converge to similar topologies that benefit from lesser amount of parameters or improved accuracy and exhibit systematic correspondence in representational complexity with the specified task.

Furthermore, we obtain wormhole configurations whose spatial section is analogous to an Ellis wormhole, but -g_tt runs from 0 to 1 as the proper radial coordinate runs from -∞ to +∞. Thus a signal sent from -∞ to +∞ through the wormhole will be infinitely red-shifted. We call such a spacetime configuration a dark wormhole. By introducing a bare cosmological constant Λ_ 0, we construct smooth solitons that are asymptotic to local AdS with an effective Λ_ eff. In the middle of bulk, the soliton metric behaves like the AdS of bare Λ_ 0 in global coordinates. We also embed AdS planar and Lifshitz black holes in f(T) gravities.

In this paper, we focus on one aspect of that structure, namely, the correlational structure which is described by the amplitude or power spectra of natural scenes. We propose that the principle insight one gains from considering the image spectra is in understanding the relative sensitivity of cells tuned to different spatial frequencies. This study employs a model in which the peak sensitivity is constant as a function of frequency with linear bandwith increasing (i. e., approximately constant in octaves). In such a model, the "response magnitude " (i. e., vector length) of cells increases as a function of their optimal (or central) spatial frequency out to about 20 cyc/deg. The result is a code in which the response to natural scenes, whose amplitude spectra typically fall as 1 /f, is roughly constant out to 20 cyc/deg. An important consideration in evaluating this model of sensitivity is the fact that natural scenes show considerable variability in their amplitude spectra, with individual scenes showing <b>falloffs</b> which are often steeper or shallower than 1 /f.

40|$|Triosephosphate {{isomerase}} (TIM) is a proficient catalyst of the reversible isomerization of {{dihydroxyacetone phosphate}} (DHAP) to D-glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP), via general base catalysis by E 165. Historically, this enzyme {{has been an}} extremely important model system for understanding the fundamentals of biological catalysis. TIM is activated through an energetically demanding conformational change, which helps position the side chains of two key hydrophobic residues (1170 and L 230), over the carboxylate side chain of E 165. This is critical both for creating a hydrophobic pocket for the catalytic base and for maintaining correct active site architecture. Truncation of these residues to alanine causes significant <b>falloffs</b> in TIM's catalytic activity, but experiments have failed to provide a full description of the action of this clamp in promoting substrate deprotonation. We perform here detailed empirical valence bond calculations of the TIM-catalyzed deprotonation of DHAP and GAP by both wild type TIM and its 1170 A, L 230 A, and 1170 A/L 230 A mutants, obtaining exceptional quantitative agreement with experiment. Our calculations provide a linear free energy relationship, with slope 0. 8, between the activation barriers and Gibbs free energies for these TIM-catalyzed reactions. We conclude that these clamping side chains minimize the Gibbs free energy for substrate deprotonation, and that the effects on reaction driving force are largely expressed at the transition state for proton transfer.

40|$|A width {{difference}} {{of the order}} of 20 % has previously been predicted for the two mass eigenstates of the B_s meson. The dominant contributor to the width difference is the b→ cc̅ s transition, with final states common to both B_s and B_s. All current experimental analyses fit the time-dependences of flavor-specific B_s-modes to a single exponential, which essentially determines the average B_s lifetime. We stress that the same data sample allows even the measurement of the width difference. To see that, this note reviews the time-dependent formulae for tagged B_s decays, which involve rapid oscillatory terms depending on Δ mt. In untagged data samples the rapid oscillatory terms cancel. Their time-evolutions depend only on the much more slowly varying exponential <b>falloffs.</b> We discuss in detail the extraction of the two widths, and identify the large (small) CP-even (-odd) rate with that of the light (heavy) B_s mass eigenstate. It is demonstrated that decay length distributions of some untagged B_s modes, such as ρ^ 0 K_S, D_s^(*) ±K^(*) ∓, can be used to extract the notoriously difficult CKM unitarity triangle angle γ. Sizable CP violating effects may be seen with such untagged B_s data samples. Listing ΔΓ as an observable allows for additional important standard model constraints. Within the CKM model, the ratio ΔΓ/ Δ m involves no CKM parameters, only a QCD uncertainty. Thus a measurement of ΔΓ (Δ m) would predict Δ m (ΔΓ), up to the QCD uncertainty. A large width difference would automatically solve the puzzle of the number of charmed hadrons per B decay in favor of theory. We also derive an upper limit of (| ΔΓ | / Γ) _B_s < 0. 3. Further, we must abandon the notion of branching fractions of B_s→ f, and instead consider B(B^ 0 _L(H) → f), in analogy to the neutral kaons. Comment: 46 pages, revte...|$|R

The first of these is a novel ASIP based interface, which allows for generic hardware block cipher cores to be used within a 32 -bit ASIP platform. An example system consisting of the Altera Nios-II and an AES block cipher is described and how the interface can be extended to support additional encryption modes of operation is discussed. A figure of merit that can be utilised to determine the efficiency of interfaces is proposed. Following on from this a thorough investigation into IKEv 2 is presented, With specific focus on hardware/software partitioning of the system. This resulted in the proposal of two systems [...] one suitable for use in an embedded context, the other suitable for server deployment [...] each capable of processing 250 key exchanges per second. The scalability of the proposed IKEv 2 systems is also investigated with respect to the number of processors and the rate at which key exchanges can be sustained. As a result, two scalable architectures are proposed [...] pipelined and iterative [...] both of which could utilise the embedded or server based implementation. A simulator was developed to determine the optimal configurations within these systems. The iterative architecture was found to be more efficient in terms of throughput and latency. Further to this, the effect of unreliable networks on the developed architectures is investigated with <b>falloffs</b> in performance being observed as the network degrades.

That is, an image which is “in focus” will have structure (e. g., edges) which has roughly the same magnitude across scale. That is, the loss of high frequency energy in some images is due to the reduction of the number of regions that contain structure rather than the amplitude of that structure. An “in focus” image will have structure (e. g., edges) across scale that have roughly equal magnitude but may vary in the area covered by structure.
