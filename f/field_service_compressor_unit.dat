40|$|Reasons for developping {{construction}} machinery in a low-noiseversion are shown. The choise of an appropriate performance class is described, {{and on this}} basis the development and construction of a low-noise <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> is displayed in separate development steps. In the EC the putting into <b>service</b> of <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> is provided in the directive of the Europian Council 79 / 113 /EEC [1]. Whereas the directives 84 / 532 /EEC [2] and 84 / 533 /EEC [3] determine an acoustic power level of L_W_A= 100 dB(A) as limit. The target of this reserch {{is to keep the}} limit value L_W_A= 88 dB(A) being determined by the RAL (Deutsches Institut fuer Guetesicherung) and to propose solutions to obtain such an improvement. The tasks refer to the body-work, the air-outlet, the aggregate, the silencer and the running gear. The result is a mobile <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> with combustion engine which remains by 12 dB(A) below the limit value of the EC. for keeping an acoustic power level of L_W_AQ= 88 dB(A) the RAL awarded the environmental sign 'Blauer Engel' to this <b>compressor</b> <b>unit.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units.</b> Traditionally, {{the operation of}} refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure. Due {{to the lack of}} scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, it is difficult to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.
