500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|Beghe {{played an}} ice hockey {{star in the}} Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature {{broadcast}} November 19, 1989. In 1991 he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: [...] "I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop {{a lot of things}} for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her." [...] He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: [...] "I thought we should kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration. But I'm an actor. I'll do whatever it takes." ...|$|E

You'd put the load on the proper shoulders <b>if</b> <b>you</b> warned your authorities, but if they didn't get to work very quietly, they'd scare the fellows off before they found out much. The trail's certainly not plain, but I guess we can follow it without showing what we're after." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ginzberg {{was born}} into a {{religious}} family whose piety and erudition was well known. The family traced its lineage back to the revered talmudist, halachist, and kabbalist Gaon of Vilna. Ginzberg emulated the Vilna Gaon’s intermingling of ‘academic knowledge’ in Torah studies under the label ‘historical Judaism’. In his book Students, Scholars and Saints, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon instructing, “Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are not in agreement with those of the Talmud.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dayton ran unsuccessfully in the U.S. Senate {{campaign}} in 1982 against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He defeated former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary, {{and the general}} election {{became one of the}} most expensive in state history. Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised [...] "to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations [...] and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> includes the Daytons, you're right". After his defeat, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990.|$|E

If that is {{entertainment}} to you, well, that's OK. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to— and go there. He could never stand being bored.

2500|$|Australia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for {{the poor}} {{performances}} and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. [...] "A team must always, always, play to win and even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> way you should never say it," [...] he told radio listeners. [...] "'The {{best we can do}} is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. If anyone is wondering why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that [...] "indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home {{at the start of the}} tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2011, {{conservative}} {{talk radio}} host Rush Limbaugh told his listening audience: [...] "When I was 10 years old I was more self-sufficient than this parade of human debris calling itself Occupy Wall Street." [...] Glenn Beck said on his internet television network GBTV, [...] "Capitalists, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{you can play}} footsies with these people, you are wrong. They will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you. They will do it. They’re not messing around." [...] Newt Gingrich said, [...] "All the Occupy movements starts with the premise that we all owe them everything. Now, that {{is a pretty good}} symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, go get a job right after you take a bath." [...] Rick Santorum also told the protesters to get jobs.|$|E

5000|$|Giunta learned {{two days}} later from Captain Kearney that the captain was going to {{recommend}} him for the Medal of Honor. He was uncomfortable about being singled out and labeled a hero. [...] "If I’m a hero, every man that stands around me, every woman in the military, everyone who goes into the unknown is a hero,” he says. “So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> a hero—as long as you include everyone with me.” Giunta insists that his actions were those of any man in his unit. “In this job, I am only mediocre. I’m average." [...] "I did what I did because {{in the scheme of}} painting the picture of that ambush, that was just my brush stroke. That’s not above and beyond. I didn’t take the biggest brush stroke, and it wasn’t the most important brush stroke. Wearing the Medal of Honor is like a slap in the face." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912 I went to Joplin, Missouri, {{just about the time}} the Titanic liner hit an iceberg and sank with more than 1,500 people on board. I was in a pool room there and beat a fellow named Snow Clark out of $500. To {{give him a chance to}} get even, I bet $200 I could jump across his pool table without {{touching}} it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> easy, try it. But I could jump farther than a herd of bullfrogs in those days. I put down an old mattress on the other side of the table. Then I took a run and dived headfirst across the pool table. While I was counting my money, somebody asked Clark what my name was [...] "It must be Titanic," [...] said Clark. [...] "He sinks everybody." [...] so I was Titanic from then on.|$|R
