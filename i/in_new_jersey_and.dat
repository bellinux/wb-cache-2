5|$|Although Gabrielle {{remained}} {{far from}} land throughout its duration, its large size caused swells in the Lesser Antilles, the East Coast of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>and</b> Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} Princeton, the Americans {{began to}} loot the abandoned British supply wagons {{and the town}} itself. With news that Cornwallis was approaching, Washington {{knew he had to}} leave Princeton. Washington wanted to push onto New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene talked him out of it. Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse on the night of January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown, by sunset the next day, for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> <b>and</b> ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that the No. 3 {{locomotive}} was placed into service in 1958, Roger Broggie decided that a fourth locomotive was needed for the DRR. After Walt Disney concurred, Broggie once again began searching for a narrow-gauge steam locomotive to purchase and restore. Broggie eventually found an advertisement in a rail magazine offering a suitable locomotive for sale <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> <b>and</b> after contacting the seller, Broggie passed on the information to Gerald Best to research the locomotive. Best was able to determine that the locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, that it had previously been used to pull tourist trains on the Pine Creek Railroad <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> <b>and</b> that it had been initially used by the Raritan River Sand Company in New Jersey. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and adding a new tender built by Fleming Metal Fabricators designed to hold diesel fuel. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 4 locomotive and it went into service on July 25, 1959, at a cost after restoration of more than $57,000. 1959 was also the year in which E tickets arrived, and the attractions deemed to be the best in the park required them, including the DRR.|$|E
5|$|Following this, US 611 was rerouted {{to cross}} the river twice {{in order to use}} the freeway through the Delaware Water Gap, and US 46 was moved to former Route 94 (pre-1953 Route 8) to end at the Columbia, New Jersey side of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. The former {{approaches}} to the Darlington's Bridge, which itself was dismantled by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission in 1954, became Route 163 <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>and</b> State Route 1039 in Pennsylvania. The US 611 freeway was designated I-80 by 1960, and US 611 was moved back to its old all-Pennsylvania alignment by 1972, leaving US 46 to end at I-80 and Route 94.|$|E

5|$|Gabrielle {{eventually}} decelerated, and {{by early}} on September10, it curved westward and weakened to a tropical storm. Gabrielle re-curved northeastward on September11 and began paralleling Nova Scotia. It further weakened to a tropical depression on September12 and was then absorbed by a developing storm near Newfoundland on September13. Due to its large size, Gabrielle produced swells and high tides in the Lesser Antilles, Bermuda, the East Coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. Rough seas along the East Coast of the United States caused one fatality in Maine, two in Massachusetts, one <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey,</b> <b>and</b> four in New York. In Nova Scotia, large waves swept one man to sea and eventually caused his drowning.|$|E
5|$|NY210 commences at the New York–New Jersey {{state line}} {{in the town of}} Warwick, where it connects to CR511 in Passaic County, New Jersey.

NY210 heads north from the state line along {{the western edge of the}} base of a deep valley {{surrounding}} the lake to a community known as Indian Park, entirely situated on the steep incline leading away from the lake. The route continues on to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, located at the northern tip of the lake.|$|E

5|$|Two {{high-level}} island platforms serve {{three of}} the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks; there is a center passing track, as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX and Norfolk Southern freights. Most SEPTA Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains (two northbound and three southbound) stop at these platforms. Two low-level platforms, a short distance to the west, serve the diverging SEPTA-owned Chestnut Hill West Line. North Philadelphia has been a flag stop on the line since 1993. The station has relatively low inbound boardings; however, it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to SEPTA and Amtrak trains to reach jobs <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>and</b> New York.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>and</b> passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
