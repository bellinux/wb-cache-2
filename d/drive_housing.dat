40|$|Keywords-drive axle housing; shell element; solid element; {{finite element}} analysis; stress Abstract. The {{finite element model}} of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing.</b> Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less. It is more feasible to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> by establishing <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> based on shell element...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on ABAQUS, {{the strain}} and {{stress on the}} <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> is {{obtained}} by the static analyses. Through the model analysis, the inherent frequencies and mode shapes of front 10 order modes are obtained respectively. According to damage accumulation theory and the rain-flow counting method, and the amplitudes and mean values of counted cycles can be determined. Fatigue analysis of automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> under the sine load spectrum are analyzed by applying ABAQUS/FE-SAFE software, and the overall fatigue life contours and distribution of hazardous area are obtained. Under the results of analysis, the improved design of automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> is made. Therefore, the new methods for improving life distribution and design of automotive <b>drive</b> axle <b>housing</b> are proposed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{residential}} areas in the northeast of the village, opposite the Southwick Allotments and the 'Farmhouse Inn' pub. The estates are linked, and named Chantry Gardens and Fleur De Lys Drive. In 2011, a small cluster of houses was built north of Fleur De Lys Drive, linked to Fleur De Lys Drive via a short path; this development was named Greenleaze Close. The second large group of housing is located {{to the south and}} west of the playing field, and has short roads branching off Blind Lane and Wesley Lane (a road winding from Wynsome Street, between the A361 and North Bradley). These roads are named Southfield, Wesley Close and Orchard <b>Drive.</b> <b>Housing</b> was also developed off Church Street in the mid-2000s, designated The Mowlems and Swan Court.|$|E
5000|$|In Windows NT 3.51, NT 4.0 and 2000, {{an attack}} was devised {{to bypass the}} local {{authentication}} system. If the SAM file is deleted from the hard drive (e.g. mounting the Windows OS volume into an alternate operating system), the attacker could log in as any account with no password. This flaw was corrected with Windows XP, which shows an error message and shuts down the computer. However, there exist software utilities, which, by the aforementioned methodology of using either an emulated virtual drive, or boot disk (usually Unix/Linux) based environment to mount the local <b>drive</b> <b>housing</b> the active NTFS partition, and using programmed software routines and function calls from within assigned memory stacks to isolate the SAM file from the Windows NT system installation directory structure (default: [...] ) and, depending on the particular software utility being used, removes the password hashes stored for user accounts in their entirety, or in some cases, modify the user account passwords directly from this environment.|$|E
5000|$|The K series BMWs have {{water-cooled}} {{engines of}} three (K75), or four (K100, K1100, K1200, K1300), or six (K1600) cylinders. Up until 2004, all K series engines, whether {{three or four}} cylinders were that of the original [...] "flying brick" [...] layout, so called due to the external appearance of the engine. The layout of these original K engines is unique within motorcycling in that the engine is mounted lying on its side, with the crank {{on the right side}} of the bike and the cylinder heads and valve gear on the left. This format had the advantage of allowing the drive system to have only one 90-degree translation within the final <b>drive</b> <b>housing,</b> potentially reducing drive train losses. All of the original format K engines were also mated to a dry automotive-type clutch. The uniform use of the traditional K engine ceased with the K1200 models in 2005, with a new 1200 series engine that was radically different from the flying brick in that it was a conventional transversely 55-degree slant-mounted four-cylinder engine coupled to a wet clutch and a unitary construction gearbox. It was at this time also that the K bike shaft drive moved from the right side to the left. Despite this new engine, the traditional flying brick K engine continued in service with the giant K1200LT luxury touring bike until 2009, at which point the flying brick bowed out along with the K1200LT. This was the event that presaged the development of the ultimate K engine in terms of size and complexity, the six-cylinder K1600 series fitted to the K1600GT and GTL models.|$|E

5000|$|Windhoff Motorradenbau GmbH built {{motorcycles}} in Berlin, Germany, from 1924-1933. The factory {{was located}} at Bülowstrasse 106, Berlin W57, {{under the direction}} of factory owner Hans Windhoff. Windhoff initially produced radiators for cars, trucks, and aircraft, setting up a factory with his brother Fritz in Rheine in 1902, then on his own in Berlin from 1907-24. In 1924 he entered the burgeoning German motorcycle market with a water-cooled two-stroke of 125cc. The engine was built under license from a design by Hugo Ruppe, whose ladepumpe (an extra piston used as a supercharger to compress the fuel/air mix) design was used most successfully by DKW in their Grand Prix racers. Windhoff had much racing success with these small two-strokes, although an experiment with enlarged two-stroke racers of 493cc and 517cc were less reliable. [...] In 1926, a totally new machine was designed; a dramatic and technically fascinating 746cc overhead camshaft, oil-cooled 4-cylinder. Only Granville Bradshaw (creator of the ABC motorcycle) had successfully used an oil-cooled engine in a motorcycle. The engine, designed by Ing. Dauben (who later joined Mercedes on the W144 - W146 racers) had no external oilways, making a very clean design. The engine finning acted as a giant radiator, with recirculating oil the cooling agent. The single overhead camshaft was driven by a train of gears {{at the front of the}} engine. Very few 4-cylinder production motorcycles of the pre-War period had an overhead camshaft (a notable rival was the first iteration of the Ariel Square Four of 1931). The 63x60mm short-stroke engine produced 22 hp at 4,000rpm, which gave an 80 mph+ top speed. The Windhoff chassis had no ‘frame’ to speak of, and the engine/gearbox unit was used as a stressed member, with the forks and rear subframe (4 parallel tubes) bolt directly onto it. The trailing-link forks use double leaf springs for damping, with no rear suspension; the rear frame tubes emerge straight out of the gearbox casting, and hold the final <b>drive</b> <b>housing</b> for the shaft drive, and rear hub and brake. Despite its massive appearance, the total weight of the machine was only 440 lbs. The price when new was 1,750DM, a bit more than the contemporary 750cc BMW R63 (1,600DM). Hans Windhoff designed a new machine for 1929, with a side valve flat-twin motor of 996cc, but the economic Crash of 1929 meant very few were produced. Windhoff struggled on with small two-stroke motorcycles of 298cc, with engines produced under license from Villiers. The company ceased operations by 1933.|$|E

30|$|To guide these {{investments}} and design the associated programs targeted at improving living standards, {{it is important}} to understand the incentives that <b>drive</b> <b>housing</b> choices of new city migrants. Toward this end, this chapter has presented a theoretical model that provides a key insight: city migrants face a trade-off between the affordability of services and transport costs. Using this trade-off as a starting point, the chapter analyzed three types of urban policies: access to housing, transport policies, and slum upgrading.|$|E
