30|$|Analogously, the {{catalytic}} {{synthesis of}} <b>glycerol</b> <b>monoacetate</b> was reported using a continuous bed column reactor packed with cation exchange resin Amberlyst 16. Starting from a solvent-free equimolar mixture of glycerol and acetic acid (7.67  mol L- 1) with a column reactor containing Amberlyst 16 (5  g), the selective esterification (50 °C, 30  min. residence time) selectively provided the corresponding monoacetate {{with a good}} selectivity [26].|$|E
40|$|Five {{hundred and}} fifty-two strains of Staphylococcus aureus of {{hospital}} origin were resistant to penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Of these, 298 were also resistant to neomycin and kanamycin, and this resistance {{was related to}} pigment production on <b>glycerol</b> <b>monoacetate</b> agar, the production of β-lysin, the absence of fibrinolytic and proteolytic activity, and to phage susceptibility. The use of physiological markers, the inadequacy of phage typing, and the possible reasons {{for the emergence of}} neomycin-resistant staphylococci are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{a review}} of the {{pharmacology}} of the fluoroacetates, Chenoweth (1949) discussed evidence that some of the greater toxicity and speed of action of the qualitatively similar, longer-chain, terminally monofluorinated, fatty acids was the result of inhibition of fatty acid oxidation at stages corresponding to the carbon-chain lengths involved. Later, Kandel and Chenoweth (1952) found evi-dence, in the accumulation of citrate in the tissues of animals poisoned with fluorobutyrate and fluorohexanoate, that the longer-chain fluorofatty acids are at least partially converted to fluoroacetate which the work of Peters ’ group has shown to inhibit the metabolism of citrate by formation of a fluorocitrate (1951, 1952, 1953). Kandel and Chenoweth were discouraged from accepting the view that the consequent inhibition of the Krebs ’ cycle was the sole or primary toxic process in fluoro-acid poisoning by finding that <b>glycerol</b> <b>monoacetate</b> (a) aug-mented the accumulation of citrate while protecting animals against the lethal effects of fluoroacetate but (b) did not protect animals against fluorobutyrate poisoning, although glycerol monobutyrate did so. Thus, the original concept o...|$|E
