The <b>English</b> <b>system</b> of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E

Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|The Curriculum for Excellence, Scotland's {{national}} school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework {{for children and}} young people from age 3 to 18. All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study Standard Grades, or Intermediate qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the Curriculum for Excellence. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for Access, Intermediate or Higher Grade and Advanced Higher qualifications. A small number of students at certain private, independent schools may follow the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> and study towards GCSEs and A and AS-Levels instead.|$|E

5|$|Before the Normans arrived, Anglo-Saxon {{governmental}} {{systems were}} {{more sophisticated than}} their counterparts in Normandy. All of England was divided into administrative units called shires, with subdivisions; the royal court was the centre of government, and a justice system based on local and regional tribunals existed to secure the rights of free men. Shires were run by officials known as shire reeves or sheriffs. Most medieval governments were always on the move, holding court wherever the weather and food or other matters were best at the moment; England had a permanent treasury at Winchester before William's conquest. One major reason for the strength of the English monarchy was the wealth of the kingdom, built on the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> of taxation that included a land tax, or the geld. English coinage was also superior to most of the other currency in use in northwestern Europe, and the ability to mint coins was a royal monopoly. The English kings had also developed the system of issuing writs to their officials, in addition to the normal medieval practice of issuing charters. Writs were either instructions to an official or group of officials, or notifications of royal actions such as appointments to office or a grant of some sort.|$|E

In the eighteenth century, Irish peerages became rewards for English politicians, limited only by the concern that they might go to Dublin and interfere with the Irish Government.|$|E

We describe the development of English to Malayalam and Malayalam to English baseline phrase based SMT system and the evaluation of its performance compared against the RBMT system. Based on our study the observations are: a) SMT systems outperform RBMT systems, b) In the case of SMT, <b>English</b> - Malayalam <b>systems</b> perform better than that of Malayalam - <b>English</b> <b>systems,</b> c) In the case RBMT, Malayalam to <b>English</b> <b>systems</b> are performing better than <b>English</b> to Malayalam <b>systems.</b> Based on our evaluations and detailed error analysis, we describe the requirements of incorporating morphological processing into the SMT to improve the accuracy of translation.

25|$|Following Roman law, the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> {{has long}} been based on a closed system of {{nominate}} torts, such as trespass, battery and conversion. This {{is in contrast to}} continental legal systems, which have since adopted more open systems of tortious liability. There are various categories of tort, which lead back to the system of separate causes of action. The tort of negligence is however increasing in importance over other types of tort, providing a wide scope of protection, especially since Donoghue v Stevenson. For liability under negligence a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1870 the law {{relating}} to criminal procedure in force in Singapore was found {{mainly in the}} Indian Criminal Procedure Act 1852, which was applicable because the Supreme Government of India had power to legislate for the Straits Settlements. After {{the passing of the}} Penal Code in 1871, the Indian Act was replaced by the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. However, in general it continued to apply the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> of criminal procedure to the Penal Code. This was subsequently found to be impracticable as the Penal Code had done away with the division of crimes into felonies and misdemeanours. Accordingly, the Criminal Procedure Ordinance 1873 was passed to remedy the situation. The Ordinance also did away with the procedure for indictments in favour of charges for all criminal offences; and abolished the grand jury, and special and common juries.|$|E
25|$|Units {{of length}} were systematized by Edward II who in 1324 defined the inch as being three barleycorns, the foot as twelve inches, the yard as three feet, the perch five and half yards and the acre {{as being an}} area four perches in width by forty perches in length. Apart from the ell (45inches or 114.3cm) which {{continued}} {{to be used in}} the cloth trade and the chain which was introduced by Edmund Gunter in 1620, these units formed the basis of the units of length of the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> of measurement. The units were however redefined many times – during Henry VIII's time standard yards and ells made of brass were manufactured, during Elizabeth I's time these were replaced with standards made of bronze and in 1742, after scientific comparisons showed a variation of up to 0.2% from the mean, a definitive standard yard was proposed (but not manufactured).|$|E
25|$|On a {{pitch that}} was heavy {{due to the}} {{continuous}} rain over the previous three days, the smaller and lighter Scottish side pushed their English counterparts hard. The Scots had a goal disallowed {{in the first half}} after the umpires decided that the ball had cleared the tape. The latter part of the match saw the Scots defence under pressure by the heavier English forwards. The Scots played two full backs, two half backs and six forwards. The English played only one full back, one half back and eight forwards. Since three defenders were required for a ball played to be onside, the <b>English</b> <b>system</b> was virtually a ready-made offside trap. Scotland would come closest to winning the match when, in the closing stages, a Robert Leckie shot landed on top of the tape which was used to represent the crossbar. At some point in the game, the England goalkeeper, Robert Barker, decided to join the action outfield when he switched places with William Maynard.|$|E
