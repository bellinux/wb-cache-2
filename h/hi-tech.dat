5|$|Franklin {{points out}} that the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for <b>hi-tech</b> devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.|$|E
5|$|The website was {{inaccessible}} to visitors {{for a week}} until the host server upgraded the security system, and filtered traffic through anti-DDoS software. Wiltshire Constabulary's <b>Hi-Tech</b> Crime Unit and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to investigate the extortion and attack; they believed it originated in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1990s {{there was}} high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British National <b>Hi-Tech</b> Crime Unit was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various regional police forces (the unit was folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century heavy {{industry}} was replaced by service-based activities including data processing, call centres, <b>hi-tech</b> electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel foundries and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also the home of the family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.|$|E
5|$|The early 1990s saw a {{rapid rise}} in land {{values in the}} Tel Aviv area {{following}} the massive immigration wave from the ex-Soviet Union and the rapid economic growth fueled by the peace prospects in 19931996 and subsequent <b>hi-tech</b> boom. This brought the issue of relocation back to light. Despite this, however, in 1997, Sde Dov was declared an International Airport for private flights. In the future, the Main Terminal, the aircraft parking aprons and the aircraft hangars will be transferred to an area near the Tel Baruch Beach which will enable {{the construction of new}} traffic routes to North Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and <b>hi-tech</b> services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{private colleges}} {{can be found}} through the city {{with most of the}} colleges are {{subsidiaries}} from universities and university colleges established in West Malaysia, such as SEGi College, Sarawak, Sunway College Kuching, Limkokwing Borneo, PTPL Sarawak, Wawasan Open University, Open University Malaysia, and Twintech College Sarawak. There are private institutions conducting franchised programmes from full-fledged universities (apart from running their own courses) such as SATT College (conducting franchised programmes from Universiti Teknologi MARA) and the Institute of Dynamic Management, Sarawak (conducting franchised programmes from Universiti Tun Abdul Razak). The International College of Advanced Technology Sarawak or ICATS is an institution created as the state government's initiative to enhance technical and vocational training education among school leavers. The college was established from the former INTI College Sarawak facilities. Operated by a state-owned subsidiary, ICATS focuses on producing human capital for the <b>hi-tech</b> sector, especially {{for the development of the}} Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy.|$|E
5|$|Until {{shortly after}} its closure was {{announced}} on 9 May 2006, the Great Universal Stores group used the former Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company building in Winton. Operations {{have since been}} transferred to a site in Shaw and Crompton. The town still has a manufacturing industry. Valtris Speciality Chemicals (Ackros Chemicals prior to April 2016), a leading chemical additive supplier and its predecessors have occupied a site on Lankro Way since 1937, the site in Eccles employs more than 100 people working in manufacturing, research, administrative and business management roles. Americhem Europe manufactures colouring for plastics and nylon fibres, employing 75 staff with a turnover of £10m.

5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, drove it across Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the Fringe in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's <b>hi-tech</b> dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{is one of}} Poland's most {{important}} economic centres and the economic hub of the Lesser Poland (Małopolska) region.
