40|$|Rhizocarpon geographicum is a crustose lichen found {{frequently}} on rock surfaces of southern aspect and less {{frequently on}} rock surfaces of northern aspect in Gwynedd, North Wales. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} the radial growth of R. geographicum thalli predicts aspect distribution. Thalli of all sizes, however, exhibited significantly greater radial growth over 18 months on northwest compared with southeast <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The hypothesis that a more intense competitive environment on northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> may explain the aspect distribution of R. geographicum was then tested. The size frequency distributions of thalli revealed a higher proportion of thalli in the smallest size class and a more restricted thallus size range on the northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, thallus mortality appeared to be greater on northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Significantly more associated lichen species were present on rock surfaces of northern aspect at sites where R. geographicum was present. The mean frequency of the associated lichen species, however, was significantly lower on surfaces of northern aspect where R. geographicum was present. In addition, two common foliose species at these sites were demonstrated experimentally to overgrow thalli of R. geographicum. It is concluded that the growth of R. geographicum over the study period did not predict aspect distribution and that differences in the competitive environments on northwest and southeast surfaces may be an important factor determining aspect distribution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Mean annual radial growth rates were greater on the south compared with the north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface.</b> In addition, the pattern of radial growth varied during the year with maximum growth recorded in the Feb/Mar. period especially on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface.</b> The levels of ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were measured in individual lobes of P. conspersa collected from the same rock surfaces on 4 days (2 Jun; 7 July and 30 Nov. 1990 and 29 Mar. 1991) during 1990 / 1991. The total of the three carbohydrates varied between days; the levels of arbitol and ribitol being significantly lower in the 7 July sample on both north and south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, the levels ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were higher on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> especially in the summer samples.

These results suggest that differences in the radial growth of P. conspersa thalli with aspect are more likely to reflect higher rates of photosynthesis on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> rather than large difference in the way carbohydrates were partitioned on the different surfaces. Lower radial growth rates may place P. conspersa at a competitive disadvantage on north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{section of}} the {{retrieved}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array drive arm (SADA) multilayer insulation (MLI), which experienced 8. 25 years of space exposure, was analyzed for environmental durability of {{the top layer of}} silver-Teflon (DuPont) fluorinated ethylene propylene (Ag-FEP). Because the SADA MLI had solar and anti-solar facing surfaces and was exposed to the space environment for a long duration, it provided a unique opportunity to study solar effects on the environmental degradation of Ag-FEP, a commonly used spacecraft thermal control material. Data obtained included tensile properties, solar absorptance, surface morphology and chemistry. The solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> was found to be extremely embrittled and contained numerous through-thickness cracks. Tensile testing indicated that the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> lost 60 % of its mechanical strength and 90 % of its elasticity while the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> had ductility similar to pristine FEP. The solar absorptance of both the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 155 plus or minus 0. 032) and the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 208 plus or minus 0. 012) were found to be greater than pristine Ag-FEP (0. 074). Solar facing and anti-solar facing surfaces were microscopically textured, and locations of isolated contamination were present on the anti-solar surface resulting in increased localized texturing. Yet, the overall texture was significantly more pronounced on the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> indicating a synergistic effect of combined solar exposure and increased heating with atomic oxygen erosion.
