It has been the source of great controversy in recent years. The study looks at the application of the doctrine of <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> in the prosecution of serious cases, and considers the implications of the recent Supreme Court ruling on <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise,</b> which determined that the law had taken ‘a wrong turn’ and required ‘correction’. The report argues that there is an urgent need for greater clarity and transparency {{in the way in which}} cases involving multiple defendants are prosecuted and sentenced in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{this essay}} I try to {{ascertain}} whether there is any normative or doctrinal foundation for the extended <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> doctrine. In particular, I examine the normativity of the “unlawfulness” rationale that has been invoked to justify the extended <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> doctrine. All the cases concerning common purpose complicity scenarios where unlawfulness has been an issue hinge on the doctrine of constructive crime, so I try to show {{that those who are}} invoking that doctrine of unlawfulness to support their normative case for extended <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> liability are working from a mistaken doctrinal premise, because the doctrine of constructive crime {{in the development of the}} law of complicity was limited to homicides; whereas complicity’s doctrine of common intent applied to all unlawful <b>joint</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Furthermore, it is contended that unlawful agreements (conspiracies) in themselves do not supply a normative justification for this sort of complicity, even when the agreement is consummated, because the accessory does not take an equal normative position in an unintended collateral crime that is merely foreseen as a possibility...|$|R

40|$|The {{main points}} of the {{following}} written evidence are as follows: The evidence presented in this submission {{is based on a}} major, ESRC-funded study being undertaken by researchers from the Institute of Criminology, at the University of Cambridge. The study is examining the experiences of male prisoners serving very long life sentences (with tariffs of 15 years or more) who were sentenced when aged 25 or younger. Just over half of the survey sample (n = 294) have been convicted under the doctrine of <b>Joint</b> <b>Enterprise.</b> Compared to the general prison population, White prisoners and Asian/Asian British prisoners are under-represented in our sample of <b>Joint</b> <b>Enterprise</b> prisoners. Black/Black British and mixed race prisoners are considerably over-represented. Compared to our general survey sample, higher proportions of the prisoners serving their sentence under Joint Enterprise: are serving longer tariffs; consider themselves not guilty of the offence for which they are convicted; and are currently appealing against their conviction, their sentence length or both. Prisoners who have been convicted under <b>Joint</b> <b>Enterprise</b> are more likely to feel that their sentence lacks legitimacy compared to those not convicted under this doctrine, complaining about a perceived absence of procedural fairness, and about both the ambiguity and the moral legitimacy of the doctrine of <b>Joint</b> <b>Enterprise.</b> We recommend improvements in data collection, so that there is greater clarity about the prevalence of successful prosecutions under <b>Joint</b> <b>Enterprise</b> and greater transparency about the offender groups to whom it is being applied...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the need to reform the UK law of <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise,</b> the scope {{of which has been}} expanded over recent years through judicial case law. It describes how <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> has become a specific weapon used by the police and the courts to target both political protest and ‘gang’ violence, in particular in black and working-class communities. The main evidence and recommendations of the House of Commons Justice Committee inquiry into <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> held in 2011 are summarised, with specific reference to how the complexity and inconsistency in application of the law, its use as a dragnet against gangs through police and prosecutorial over-charging, and convictions based on ‘foresight’ rather than criminal intent, can all lead to miscarriages of justice. The particular problems {{associated with the use of}} <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> in relation to murder are described. The article concludes by examining the response of the UK authorities to the Justice Committee report, with specific reference to new draft prosecutorial guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which fails to clarify the law and in fact confirms the need for new legislation in this area...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} English {{doctrine}} of <b>joint</b> criminal <b>enterprise</b> {{by way of}} a comparative study. <b>Joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> allows for the conviction of an accomplice (S) of an offence (crime B) committed by his associate-in-crime (P) on the basis of S's foresight of its commission by P as a possible incident to their joint criminal venture (crime A). While it is generally accepted that this common law principle needs reforming, successive governments have declined to take on the task. Against this backdrop, this thesis explores whether the contentious features of <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> liability might be reformed by way of common law development. To this end, the thesis examines the doctrineâs constituent elements, its function, underlying rationale and place within the structure of primary and secondary liability. Particular emphasis is put on the specific problems associated with the application of <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> liability in the context of murder. Looking at the functional equivalents of <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> in German law, the thesis challenges the orthodox view that <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> is a head of liability available to the prosecution alongside co-perpetration and aiding and abetting. Indeed, it argues that an inculpatory function of the principle is difficult to justify and suggests that, both historically {{and as a matter of}} principle, it is better seen as an exculpatory device aimed at delineating the scope of co-perpetration and aiding and abetting. The thesis concludes that the current law does not serve this function very well, as its mens rea threshold (some form of recklessness, when proof of intention is needed to convict the principal offender) sets the hurdle for conviction of secondary parties indefensibly low. Informed by ideas taken from German law â especially an extended concept of intention known as dolus eventualis â the thesis's principal contention is that English law would do better defining <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> liability in terms of foresight plus endorsement. Indeed, the thesis aims to show that English law was very close to such a conception, and that the common law took a wrong turn in Powell. It concludes that it is still open to the Supreme Court to adopt an endorsement-focussed approach to <b>joint</b> <b>enterprise</b> liability, thereby alleviating concerns that the law in this area is too harsh and over-inclusive, and bringing it closer to the threshold of liability for principal offenders which requires proof of intention. Such an approach would also make the law of complicity more principled and coherent. </p...|$|R
