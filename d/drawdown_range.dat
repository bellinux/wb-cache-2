40|$|A {{water balance}} model was {{developed}} for Bung Boraphet reservoir, a large flood plain lake in Thailand, from daily measurements over three inflow outflow cycles between 2003 and 2006. Measurement error was 10 % (as one standard deviation) of the total measured volume. The specific yield from the Bung Boraphet catchment was 3. 9 m 3 /ha/yr and surface water inflow from the local catchment was the largest gain term and evaporation was the largest loss term in the water budget. Irrigation was the second largest loss term and dry season demand exceeded the storage supply. Uncontrolled extraction of water for irrigation {{is regarded as a}} threat to the reservoir fishery, although the increasing <b>drawdown</b> <b>range</b> may benefit wetland biodiversity. Sustainable management of the Bung Boraphet wetland will depend on careful management based on an informed understanding of the ecohydrological requirements of all wetland uses. Water balance models like this one are recommended as a tool to allocate water equitably and in ways which can be integrated across the Chao Phraya basin...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{resources}} are becoming the primary factor for maintaining life in arid areas. Understanding land use/cover change {{and its effect}} on groundwater depth would enhance land use and groundwater management for typical desert-oasis transition zones. Reduction of groundwater recharge and increase of groundwater exploitation during 1985 and 2010 led to the decrease of groundwater depth in Linze County. The region with groundwater depth less than 5 m decreased by 187 km 2 from 1985 to 2010 as a result of industrial growth, agricultural and economic development. Land use has undergone significant spatial and temporal changes. Farmland and built up land expanded by 53. 02 % and 30. 91 %, respectively. The expansion of farmland reached a peak between 1996 and 2005 with an increasing rate of 25. 70 %, while areas of grassland, woodland, water body and unused land decreased, and the decreasing rate was 9. 38 %, 58. 35 % and 19. 81 %. From 1985 to 2010, the groundwater depth rose slightly (0 – 1. 2 m) in the edge of desert (24. 21 km 2), which was caused by the surrounding farmland irrigation recharge. The <b>drawdown</b> <b>range</b> of groundwater depth between 0 and 3 m was distributed in the central oasis, which was caused by the expansion of farmland and degradation of natural vegetation. This study aims to provide a basis for the reasonable utilization of water resources, the formation of management strategies, as well as to provide ecosystem stability and sustainable development of oases in the study area...|$|E
40|$|The DOE and BLM {{identified}} 285, 000 {{acres of}} desert {{land in the}} Chuckwalla valley in the western U. S., for solar energy development. In addition to several approved solar projects, a pumped storage project was recently proposed to pump nearly 8000 acre-ft-yr of groundwater to store and stabilize solar energy output. This study aims at providing estimates {{of the amount of}} naturally-occurring recharge, and to estimate the impact of the pumping on the water table. To better provide the locations and intensity of natural recharge, this study employs an integrated, physically-based hydrologic model, PAWS+CLM, to calculate recharge. Then, the simulated recharge is used in a parameter estimation package to calibrate spatially-distributed K field. This design is to incorporate all available observational data, including soil moisture monitoring stations, groundwater head, and estimates of groundwater conductivity, to constrain the modeling. To address the uncertainty of the soil parameters, an ensemble of simulations are conducted, and the resulting recharges are either rejected or accepted based on calibrated groundwater head and local variation of the K field. The results indicate that the natural total inflow to the study domain is between 7107 and 12, 772 afy. During the initial-fill phase of pumped storage project, the total outflow exceeds the upper bound estimate of the inflow. If the initial-fill is annualized to 20 years, the average pumping is more than the lower bound of inflows. The results indicate after adding the pumped storage project, the system will nearing, if not exceeding, its maximum renewable pumping capacity. The accepted recharges lead to a <b>drawdown</b> <b>range</b> of 24 to 45 ft for an assumed specific yield of 0. 05. However, the drawdown is sensitive to this parameter, whereas there is insufficient data to adequately constrain this parameter...|$|E
40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{availability model}} for the Nacatoch Aquifer was used to estimate drawdown in the aquifer under five pumping scenarios in Groundwater Management Area 8. In Scenario 1, pumping from the 2007 State Water Plan, approximately 9, 400 acre-feet per year, resulted in an average drawdown of 5 feet between 2011 and 2060. In the subsequent four scenarios containing increased pumping, average <b>drawdowns</b> <b>ranged</b> from 6 to 12 feet with pumping ranging from 9, 700 to 17, 300 acre-feet per year...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{measurements}} of land subsidence above pumped aquifers by permanent GPS and InSAR have exhibited some delay relative to <b>drawdown</b> <b>ranging</b> from months to years. The current modeling approaches accounting for water fluid dynamics and porous medium geomechanics {{may fail to}} predict such a delay and may underestimate the land settlement after the well shutdown. In the present communication, an investigation is made on the residual compaction of the intervening clayey formations as a possible contribution to retarded land subsidence. The pore pressure variation within the aquifer and its propagation in the clay are simulated by a finite element flow model, with the resulting pore pressure decline used as input data in a hypoplastic geomechanical model. A proper sensitivity analysis on (i) aquifer depth, (ii) ratio between the sandy and the clayey layers thickness and hydraulic conductivity, (iii) oedometric compressibility in first and second loading cycles, is performed for a typical geology of a Quaternary sedimentary basin. The results show that a certain fraction, up to 20...|$|R
40|$|Current {{modeling}} {{of the southeastern}} portion of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) with a refined U. S. Geological Survey Death Valley regional groundwater flow system model shows that impacts from pumping by proposed Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) and Vidler Water Company (VWC) wells can be substantial over 75 years of operation. Results suggest that significant drawdown at proposed well sites will occur with depths of <b>drawdown</b> <b>ranging</b> from 8 m to nearly 1, 600 m. The areal extent of 0. 5 m of drawdown is also significant, impacting Mercury Valley, Amargosa, Indian Springs, Three Lakes, and Frenchman Flat basins. Drawdown will impact Army No. 1 Water Well in Mercury Valley by lowering water levels 2. 1 m but will not impact other NTS production wells. It is also predicted that flowpaths from detonation sites within the NTS will be altered {{with the potential to}} move material out of the NTS. Impacts to both springs and regions of groundwater evapotranspiration (modeled as MODFLOW drain cells) appear very minimal, with an estimated 0. 2 -percent reduction in flow to these regions. This amounts to a loss of more that 55, 000 m 3 /year (45 acre-ft/year), or more than 4, 000, 000 m 3 (3, 400 acre-ft) during 75 years of groundwater withdrawal by pumping at proposed SNWA and VWC wells. Whether the reduced flow will impact specific springs more than any others, or if the reduction in flow is enough to have significant ecological implications, was not addressed in this study...|$|R
