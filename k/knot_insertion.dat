40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm {{to compute the}} degree-raised version of a spline. The new algorithm is {{as fast as the}} best existing algorithm, but is much easier to understand and to implement. The new control vertices of the degree-raised spline are obtained simply by a series of <b>knot</b> <b>insertions</b> followed by a series of knot deletions. Keywords: B-splines, splines, degree elevation, algorithm, blossoming. 1 Introduction Several algorithms have been published that raise the degree of B-spline curves [PP 91, Pra 84, CLS 85, PT 94]. The fastest of these is by Prautzsch and Piper [PP 91]. However, this algorithm is complex and difficult to understand. From a software engineering point of view, it is desirable to implement a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm. This approach was taken by Piegl and Tiller [PT 94], who implemented the simplest algorithm: they converted the B-spline curve to B'ezier form, raised the degree of the B'ezier curves, and then pieced together the B'ezier cur [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|A T-spline surface can {{be thought}} of as a NURBS surface for which a row of control points is allowed to {{terminate}} without traversing the entire surface. The control net at a terminated row resembles the letter [...] "T". Modeling surfaces with T-splines can reduce the number of control points in comparison to NURBS surfaces and make pieces easier to merge, but increases the book-keeping effort to keep track of the irregular connectivity. T-splines can be converted into NURBS surfaces, by <b>knot</b> <b>insertion,</b> and NURBS can be represented as T-splines without T's or by removing knots. T-splines can therefore, in theory, do everything that NURBS can do. In practice, enormous amount of programming was required to make NURBS work as well as they do, and creating the equivalent T-Spline functionality would require similar effort. To smoothly join at points where more than three surface pieces meet, T-splines have been combined with geometrically continuous constructions of degree 3 by 3 (bi-cubic) and, more recently, of degree 4 by 4 (bi-quartic).|$|E

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} find {{subdivision}} rules at creases in arbitrary degree subdivision for piece-wise polynomial curves, {{but without}} introducing new control points e. g. by <b>knot</b> <b>insertion.</b> Crease rules are well understood for low degree (cubic and lower) curves. We compare three main approaches: <b>knot</b> <b>insertion,</b> ghost points, and modifying subdivision rules. While <b>knot</b> <b>insertion</b> and ghost points work for arbitrary degrees for B-splines, these methods introduce unnecessary (ghost) control points. The situation is not so simple in modifying subdivision rules. Based on subdivision and subspace selection matrices, a novel approach to finding boundary and sharp subdivision rules that generalises to any degree is presented. Our approach leads to new higher-degree polynomial subdivision schemes with crease control without introducing new control points...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the construction of}} new C 2 rational cubic spline interpolant with cubic numerator and quadratic denominator. The idea has been extended to shape preserving interpolation for positive data using the constructed rational cubic spline interpolation. The rational cubic spline has three parameters αi, βi, and γi. The sufficient conditions for the positivity are derived on one parameter γi while the other two parameters αi and βi are free parameters {{that can be used to}} change the final shape of the resulting interpolating curves. This will enable the user to produce many varieties of the positive interpolating curves. Cubic spline interpolation with C 2 continuity is not able to preserve the shape of the positive data. Notably our scheme is easy to use and does not require <b>knots</b> <b>insertion</b> and C 2 continuity can be achieved by solving tridiagonal systems of linear equations for the unknown first derivatives di, i= 1,…,n- 1. Comparisons with existing schemes also have been done in detail. From all presented numerical results the new C 2 rational cubic spline gives very smooth interpolating curves compared to some established rational cubic schemes. An error analysis when the function to be interpolated is ft∈C 3 t 0,tn is also investigated in detail...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} algorithm for subdividing non-uniform B-splines of arbitrary degree {{in a manner}} similar to the Lane-Riesenfeld subdivision algorithm for uniform Bsplines of arbitrary degree. Our algorithm consists of doubling the control points followed by d rounds of non-uniform averaging similar to the d rounds of uniform averaging in the Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm for uniform B-splines of degree d. However, unlike the Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm which follows most directly from the continuous convolution formula for the uniform B-spline basis functions, our algorithm follows naturally from blossoming.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Knot</b> <b>insertion</b> is the {{operation}} of obtaining a new representation of a B-spline curve by introducing additional knot values to the defining knot vector. The new curve has control points consisting of the original control points and additional new control points corresponding {{to the number of}} new knot values. So knot insertions give additional control points which provide extra shape control without necessarily subdividing the curve. However, if following a <b>knot</b> <b>insertion</b> operation a knot has multiplicity equal to the degree, then the B-spline is split into two B-splines at that knot value. In this paper the concept of <b>knot</b> <b>insertion</b> for analyzing interval B-spline curve has been introduced. The four fixed Kharitonov's polynomials (four fixed B-spline curves) associated with the original interval B-spline curve are obtained. The four fixed Kharitonov's polynomials (four fixed B-spline curves) are subdivided by inserting additional knot values while maintaining an open uniform knot vector. Finally, the required interval control points are obtained from the fixed control points of the four fixed subdivided Kharitonov's polynomials. The problem of parametric interval B-spline curve reparametrization is also discussed. The shape of the curve remains unchanged during the process of reparametrization; only the way the curve is described is altered. If {{it is important that the}} degree of the given curve should be kept unchanged, we may choose a linear reparametrization function. Numerical examples are included in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The method allows to remove knots in arbitrary order minimizing {{the displacement of}} control points when a knot is re-inserted. Geometric detail subtracted from a shape by knot removal is represented by an associated wavelet coefficient replacing one of the control points at a coarser level of detail. From the hierarchy of wavelet coefficients, perfect reconstruction of the original shape is obtained. Both <b>knot</b> removal and <b>insertion</b> have local impact. Wavelet synthesis and analysis are both computed in linear time, based on the lifting scheme for biorthogonal wavelets.

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the role of}} genetic, environmental and intrauterine factors in child development using data from two large twin studies; the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS) and the Twins and Multiple Births Association Heritability Study (TAMBAHS). An association between birth weight and child development has already been established. Potential associations between other factors of the intrauterine environment and child development were investigated in this thesis. Heritabilities of the umbilical cord, IQ, temperament and behaviour problems were estimated. Fetal characteristics, such as birth weight, placental weight and morphology, umbilical cord <b>knots,</b> length and <b>insertions</b> were investigated in relation to cognitive development in the EFPTS study. The impact of maternal pre-pregnancy weight on temperament and behaviour problems was examined in the TAMBAHS study. High heritability estimates were observed for certain dimensions of the umbilical cord, temperament and IQ; for behaviour problems, genetic, shared and non-shared environment were important. Low birth weight and cord knotting was associated with lower IQ; an association was observed between maternal overweight and children aggressive behaviour.

40|$|Knot-related defects are {{the major}} cause of timber quality degradation, and {{diminishing}} this kind of defects {{is an important issue}} in forest management. For the purpose of clear-wood production, knot attributes and branch occlusion of Betula alnoides under natural pruning were investigated in a 14 -year-old experimental plantation with five planting densities ranging from 500 to 3333 stems per hectare in southern China, and a total of 1325 occluded branches from 30 trees were sampled and dissected. The mean occluded branch diameter (OBD), radius of <b>knots</b> and branch <b>insertion</b> angle (IA) decreased significantly with increasing planting density. Planting with high stocking density significantly reduced the frequency of thick occluded branches (diameter ≥ 20 mm) while increasing the frequency of small ones (diameter < 10 mm). Branch occlusion time (OT) also tended to increase with decreasing planting density. The results of generalized linear mixed models showed that OBD was the major factor influencing OT, radius of dead portion of knot (RDP), total radius of knot (TRK) and IA. In addition, OT was positively correlated with RDP but negatively correlated with stem diameter growth rate during branch occlusion (SDGR). Silvicultural strategies with appropriate planting density for large-diameter clear-wood production of B. alnoides were discussed...|$|R

Thus, an investigation of the underlying mechanisms of the development of cord morphology and possible pathologies associated with it may provide an insight into fetal growth in the intrauterine environment and have an impact on later development of the child. This is the first study to report the relative contribution of genes and environment {{in the development of the}} cord. 11. 980 twins were included in this study. Umbilical cord length, <b>insertion,</b> <b>knots,</b> twisting and number of vessels were examined by trained midwives at birth. Means and percentages of cord characteristics by twin zygosity/chorionicity and gender were calculated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square statistics were performed to calculate discordance in cord morphology between dizygotic (DZ), monozygotic monochorionic (MZMC) and monozygotic dichorionic (MZDC) twins. Univariate genetic models were fit to the {{umbilical cord}} characteristics to investigate the genetic and environmental influence on umbilical cord morphology. Mainly non-shared environmental but also genetic factors influence umbilical cord morphology. In MZMC male and female twins a peripheral/marginal cord insertion was significantly (P < 0. 01) more prevalent compared to MZDC and DZ male and female twins respectively. In MZMC male twins, clockwise twisting was significantly (P = 0. 02) less frequent compared to DZ twins. Environmental and genetic factors influence cord morphology and pathology.
