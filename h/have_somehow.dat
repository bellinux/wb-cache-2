Synovial fluid cultures are negative, suggesting that reactive arthritis is caused either by an autoimmune response involving cross-reactivity of bacterial antigens with joint tissues or by bacterial antigens that <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> become deposited in the joints.|$|E
25|$|Max, Chris, Gertie, Duncan, and Vicki {{wake up in}} the woods. Every 92 minutes, they {{encounter}} a van with two characters from Camp Bloodbath, and realize they <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> been transported inside the movie. The group awkwardly pass themselves off as new camp counselors, and hitch a ride to camp. They let the first couple of murders happen without interference, but when Duncan is killed by the film's machete-wielding villain Billy Murphy, they realize that they too run the risk of becoming victims.|$|E
25|$|The Acamoth / The Gulmoth: The monstrous, alien {{beings that}} {{originate}} {{beyond the threshold}} of existence, in the Abyssal gulf between the Supernal Realm and the Fallen World. Because of their nature, they are incapable of contacting or having any power in either the Supernal or Fallen World, and as such they require agents to grant them potency. Gulmoth are the entities that normally reside in the Abyss until summoned either by catastrophic Paradox or deliberate summoning by insane or desperate mages, existing only {{for a time in}} the Fallen World to further the Abyss' overall goal of destroying the cosmos. Acamoth are those Abyssal beings that <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> become trapped in the cosmos, and offer mages pacts in return for using their souls as vessels to mentally journey back to their home - a proposition that deeply threatens their sanity.|$|E

Guest actor Kevin Corrigan returned as recurring character Sam Weiss. The episode featured guest stars Jody Thompson and Paul Jarrett as the new characters Sara Downey and Warren Blake, respectively. Thompson called the part [...] "the kind of role that actors dream of". She described the episode, [...] "The material was so compelling and perfectly written {{it was a matter}} of not getting in the way of what the creators had created. I’m anxious about how it will come off. Truthfully, I’ve been torturing myself, wondering if I <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> ruined the beauty of what I read in the script".|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News {{gave the}} film {{one out of}} five stars. She criticized the lack of Bell's screentime saying, [...] "What the filmmakers of the last four Saw movies <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> {{overlooked}} is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in Saw III. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become [...] "painfully stilted" [...] and called the script [...] "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, [...] "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" [...] and closed her review with, [...] "No matter how much money The Final Chapter makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sun Herald {{thought of}} the {{character}} as [...] "a thoroughly charming intergalactic thief famed for using her allure to get what she wants", and Matt Roush of TV Guide called Claudia Black [...] "great fun to watch in [...] ". TV Zones Stephen Graves believed that Browder and Black's first post-Farscape encounter in Stargate SG-1s [...] "Avalon" [...] was [...] "somewhat underplayed [...] but Black makes up for this with her sparky, snarky characterization of Vala." [...] He welcomed the producers' decision to not cast a carbon copy of Samantha Carter, and thought that Claudia Black's Vala in her six-episode arc remained [...] "the best thing in the series". By season 10's [...] "Memento Mori", TV Zones Anthony Brown felt that [...] "Ben Browder and Claudia Black have...reached {{a point where they}} can play out an amusing take on Misery without you feeling that [...] <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> starbursted onto SG-1s Earth".

500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E

2500|$|Emmy was the ship's cat on [...] She was {{an orange}} tabby cat who {{never missed a}} voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy jumped ship while in port in Quebec City. The crew {{returned}} her to the ship, but she left again, leaving her kittens behind. [...] The Empress of Ireland left without her, which {{was regarded as a}} terrible omen. She was reportedly last seen {{on the roof of the}} shed at Pier 27, watching her ship sail out of Quebec City. [...] Early the next morning Empress of Ireland collided with [...] while steaming through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and rapidly sank, killing over 1,000 people. Some have believed it's possible that Emmy may <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> foreseen the ship's demise to be the reason why she refused to board her that day.|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect historians {{debate whether}} {{the impact of}} {{continued}} blockade, relentless bombing, and the Russian invasion of Manchuria would <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> forced the Emperor to surrender sometime in late 1945 or early 1946 even without the atomic bombs (though not without very large numbers of allied casualties). Stimson looked beyond the immediate end of the war. He was the only top government official who tried to predict {{the meaning of the}} atomic age—he envisioned a new era in human affairs. For a half century he had worked to inject order, science, and moralism into matters of law, of state, and of diplomacy. The impact of the atom bomb, he thought, would go far beyond military concerns to encompass diplomacy and world affairs, as well as business, economics and science. Above all, said Stimson, this [...] "most terrible weapon ever known in human history" [...] opened up [...] "the opportunity to bring the world into a pattern in which the peace of the world and our civilization can be saved." [...] That is, the very destructiveness of the new weaponry would shatter the ages-old belief that wars could be advantageous. It might now be possible to call a halt to the use of destruction as a ready solution to human conflicts. Indeed, society's new control over the most elemental forces of nature finally [...] "caps the climax of the race between man's growing technical power for destructiveness and his psychological power of self-control and group control--his moral power." ...|$|E

2500|$|The HDD's {{spindle system}} relies on air density inside the disk {{enclosure}} {{to support the}} heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the breather filter). If the air density is too low, then {{there is not enough}} lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about [...] Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives – they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|E
2500|$|Michael F. Whiting, {{director}} of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center {{and an associate}} professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article [...] "DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective" [...] that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA [...] "have not given us anything that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they <b>have</b> <b>somehow</b> proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas." [...] Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, [...] "given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, because {{we do not know what}} genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record." [...] Lastly, he concludes, [...] " [...] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost." [...] and that, [...] "here are some very good scientific reasons for why the Book of Mormon is neither easily corroborated nor refuted by DNA evidence, and current attempts to do so are based on dubious science" [...]|$|E
