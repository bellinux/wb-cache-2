5|$|Downhill it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> topple {{over the}} front wheel because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals {{to try to keep}} m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron {{and the creation of}} another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E
25|$|In forests where rattan grows, its {{economic}} value can help protect forest land, by providing {{an alternative to}} loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest rattan canes instead. Rattan <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> harvest, requires simpler tools and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. It {{remains to be seen}} whether rattan can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.|$|E

25|$|The formal {{machinery}} of this proof is wholly elementary {{except for the}} diagonalization that the diagonal lemma requires.

Hence Tarski's theorem <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> motivate and prove than the more celebrated theorems of Gödel about the metamathematical properties of first-order arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for Hong Kong people to learn {{traditional}} Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media).
