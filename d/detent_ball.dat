2500|$|Walker {{refined and}} popularized the design, {{eventually}} securing a trademark {{for the name}} [...] "Linerlock" [...] in March 1990. Walker's improvement to the design was to facilitate true one handed opening of the knife. [...] This was accomplished by removing the weak back spring and adding a heat-treated stop pin to align the blade in the open position. [...] Walker added a <b>detent</b> <b>ball</b> to hold the blade in the closed position using the same spring force from the liner.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>detents</b> are {{commonly}} found in the selector mechanism of a gearbox, holding the selector rods in the correct position to engage the desired gear. Other applications include clutches that slip at a preset torque, and calibrated <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> mechanisms are typically found in a torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate <b>ball</b> <b>detents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lockup is {{accomplished}} by a centerpin {{in the rear of}} the cylinder and a <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> in the frame.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>detents</b> {{are one of}} the {{mechanisms}} often used in folding knives to prevent unwanted opening of the blade when carrying it.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of a push button swivel attached to the sling (approximate diameter 9.4 mm, a little under [...] inches) which is placed into a mouting socket on the firearm (approximate diameter 9.6 mm, a little over [...] inches). The swivel is kept in place by a four <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> connected to the push button, which presses against {{the walls of the}} socket. The sling swivel can quickly be taken on and off by pushing the QD button, which retracts the <b>ball</b> <b>detents.</b> The flush cup sockets can be either rotating or non rotating.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> is {{a simple}} {{mechanical}} arrangement used to hold a moving part in a temporarily fixed position relative to another part. Usually the moving parts slide with respect to each other, or one part rotates within the other.|$|R
50|$|The bore is the {{interior}} {{diameter of the}} barrel. The bore must properly match the type of paint being fired, the most critical aspect of a barrel. A mismatched selection will result in velocity variations, which causes difficulty in maintaining a close match to field velocity limits and in extreme cases it can affect accuracy. Two and three-piece barrels let the barrel bore be matched to the paint diameter without needing new barrels. Correct matching is especially important in closed-bolt markers that lack <b>ball</b> <b>detents</b> because the <b>ball</b> will roll down, and potentially out of, the barrel. This results in either a dry fire {{in the event that}} the ball fell out of the barrel, or a lower velocity shot.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of presetting torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> type limiter transmits {{force through}} {{hardened}} balls which rest in detents {{on the shaft}} and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.|$|R
5000|$|However, if {{the spring}} is {{too weak to}} always move the rooster comb {{to the bottom of}} the trough between the teeth, the vehicle can be left between gears. On certain U.S. car manufacturers' vehicles, the problem is made worse as there is a flat spot between [...] "Park" [...] and [...] "Reverse" [...] <b>detents</b> where the <b>ball</b> can rest, also {{resulting}} in a [...] "false park".|$|R
50|$|The Matrix also {{features}} a removable breech. The breech is able to be removed via a rod that runs {{the entire length of}} the body. The stock breech is threaded to accept Autococker threaded barrels and has a pair of rubber <b>ball</b> <b>detents.</b> The detents can easily be removed and cleaned or replaced using an o-ring pick to remove them and a hex key to push them back in. The completely removable breech leaves ways for aftermarket manufactures to develop new and improved breeches.|$|R
5000|$|Most notably, Walker {{is known}} for the {{invention}} of the Walker Linerlock in 1981, which has since become the industry standard in folding knife mechanisms. [...] What sets Walker’s design apart is a long split in one of the liners which acts as a leaf-spring in the liner of the knife accompanied. This feature cuts down on mechanical stress. An additional feature of the Linerlock is the addition of a <b>ball</b> <b>detent.</b> This additional feature eliminates rubbing and scratch-marks when the knife is opened and closed.|$|R
5000|$|With some {{automatic}} transmissions, it {{was possible}} to place the shift selector at any point, either in an intended gear or between a gear. Because of the possible safety issue of this, and because driving a vehicle not fully in a gear {{over a long period of}} time could damage the transmission, automakers developed what is called the [...] "detent system." [...] The system of detents was often used in conjunction with the [...] "push button" [...] shifters used on many automatics in the 1950s. Typical detent systems use either a <b>detent</b> spring and <b>ball</b> or a cantilever spring and this spring moves up and down over a series of teethed gears (called a [...] "rooster comb" [...] for how it looks, or an [...] "inner manuel lever") turning the rooster comb to fine center the transmission in the intended gear position at the bottom of each gear.|$|R
2500|$|The Umnumzaan is {{a folding}} pocket knife {{manufactured}} by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho, and designed by Chris Reeve. The name [...] "Umnumzaan" [...] {{is derived from}} the Zulu language, meaning [...] "Head of the family," [...] or [...] "Boss" [...] (colloq.), a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South Africa origins.The Umnumzaan was designed {{to meet the needs of}} operators seeking a heavy-duty folder capable of handling heavy use and even abuse. Building upon the Sebenza’s success, the Umnumzaan features: a stronger pivot joint, a thicker blade, a different blade grind with a reinforced tip, improved ergonomics, thicker titanium handles, a thicker titanium lock bar, a stronger ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> system, a larger titanium spacer (sometimes called a “stand off”), a phosphor-bronze washer system designed to act as a ‘dry-sump’ to retain lubrication and keep dirt out, an oversized ambidextrous-thumb studs & extended lock bar to aid operation when wearing gloves, a lanyard pivot joint that uses pivoting lanyard tie bars, and a deeply textured grip.|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multisetting Torque Limiter {{will be used}} by astronauts {{during the}} First Servicing Mission STS- 61. It was {{designed}} to replace several individual torque limiters. This replacement reduces the number of tools required as well as reduce the time required for servicing. The Multisetting Torque Limiter design specified five separate torque settings: 2, 5. 3, 9, 35 and 45 ft-lbs. This original units were tested at the 2, 5. 3, and 9 ft-lbs settings and {{did not meet the}} design specifications. The 35 ft-lb and 45 ft-lb torque settings were not incorporated into the original flight design. The objective of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) redesign effort is to incorporate all five torque settings into a flight design which means the requirements for the first HST Servicing Mission. The first target of the redesign effort focused on the spring chamber and <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> design. The original design used belleville springs in parallel; the new design changed this configuration to belleville springs stacked in series. The current engineering unit was successfully tested in ambient environment at all five settings. A flight design will soon undergo thermal vacuum testing to evaluate its performance at the temperature extremes...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "ball detent" [...] is {{also used}} when {{referring}} to a mechanism in paintball markers designed to prevent the [...] paintball from rolling out of the firing chamber before being fired. Some designs {{are similar to those}} outlined above, with a cartridge utilizing a ball bearing in a bore with spring pressure. The cartridge is installed perpendicular to the barrel bore axis, just ahead of where the ball rests before being fired. Other designs use elastic rubber protrusions that block the ball until it is pushed over it by the bolt. Some designs use precisely calibrated rings or [...] "barrel sizers" [...] that are selected to have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the paintballs being used. They rely on simple constriction of the bore to prevent paintballs from rolling through them from the force of gravity. When the marker is fired, the air pressure pushes the ball through the bore, causing it to compress enough to pass through. Paintballs have varying diameters depending on a number of factors; this type of <b>ball</b> <b>detent</b> must be sized correctly to avoid compressing the paintball too much, causing it to burst. If a too large sizer is selected, balls may roll through it.|$|R
