2500|$|In Dark Rivers prologue, it is {{revealed}} {{that there are}} tunnels beneath the moorland. Fallen Leaves, a mysterious cat not mentioned before {{in any of the}} books, enters a tunnel, meeting a misshapen, old cat by the name of Rock, who explains to him that to be a [...] "sharpclaw", he must {{find a way out of}} the tunnels and onto the moor.

2500|$|The Man Who Has Never Willingly Attended A Sporting Event - Dan's brother, artist David [...] "LEBO" [...] Le Batard, makes regular {{appearances}} {{to answer}} sports questions {{despite the fact}} that he has no interest in sports.

60|$|Science, with a {{thousand}} triumphs to her credit, has not yet succeeded in discovering the correct reply {{for a young man}} to make who finds himself in the appalling position of being apologized to by a pretty girl. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> nothing he seems sullen and unforgiving. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> anything he makes a fool of himself.

5000|$|Whether Random says ja or da {{should be}} thought of as {{depending}} on the flip of a coin hidden in his brain: if the coin comes down heads, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> ja; <b>if</b> tails, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> da.|$|R
