5|$|Disgruntled, Mau began {{recruiting}} for a coup, targeting Khánh, who {{had been}} moved to the I Corps in the far north of South Vietnam to keep him far away from Saigon. Khánh {{made no attempt to}} hide his annoyance at not being given a more <b>important</b> <b>job,</b> and had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer by his colleagues. Mau persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta by telling them that as Khánh had played a large part in putting down the 1960 coup attempt, Thi would still be harboring resentment. According to Mau, Thi would thus be an ideal mechanism for keeping the disliked Khánh in check. Privately, Mau predicted that Thi would act as a bridge between him in Saigon, and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant as allegiances shifted over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims.|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Thảo was a {{communist}} {{officer in the}} Vietminh and helped oversee various operations in the Mekong Delta in the far south, at one point commanding his future enemy Nguyễn Khánh, who briefly served the communist cause. After the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam, Thảo stayed {{in the south and}} made a show of renouncing communism. He became part of the military establishment in the anti-communist southern regime and quickly rose through the ranks. Nominally Catholic, Thảo befriended Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục—the devoutly Roman Catholic Ngô family strongly favored co-religionists and had great trust in Thảo, unaware that he was still loyal to the communists. He went on to serve as the chief of Bến Tre Province, and gained fame after the area—traditionally {{a communist}} stronghold—suddenly became peaceful and prosperous. Vietnamese and US officials, as well as journalists hostile to or supportive of Saigon, misinterpreted this as a testament to Thảo's great ability, and he was promoted to a more powerful position where he could further his sabotage. Thảo and the communists in the local area had simply stopped fighting, so that the communists could quietly recuperate, while Thảo would appear to be very skillful and be given a more <b>important</b> <b>job</b> where he could do more damage.|$|E

25|$|Maurice Princet {{joined us}} often. Although quite young, {{thanks to his}} {{knowledge}} of mathematics he had an <b>important</b> <b>job</b> in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.|$|E
25|$|Members' dues underwrite much of AFT's {{political}} activities. In 2015, four California teachers sued AFT and its California unit, the California Federation of Teachers, {{over the}} use of member dues for political activities. The plaintiffs argued that unions were violating their constitutional right to free speech by forcing them to either support union-favored causes and candidates or lose access to <b>important</b> <b>job</b> benefits such as disability and life insurance.|$|E
25|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is often thought {{to reflect the}} extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to <b>important</b> <b>job</b> outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E

25|$|Goalkeeper is {{the most}} {{defensive}} position in football. The goalkeeper's main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area {{for most of the}} game. As a result, goalkeepers have a better view of the pitch and often give advice to their defence when the other team is on the attack or during set pieces. Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another <b>important</b> <b>job</b> {{and is one of the}} hardest to master as keeper.|$|E
25|$|Women {{also were}} working on the platform, distributing the basics of fruit, matches, and candy bars for those who were unable to go inside. One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another <b>important</b> <b>job</b> was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who went inside. Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would walk {{up and down the aisles}} distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E
25|$|In October 1925, Crosby and {{his partner}} Al Rinker, brother of singer Mildred Bailey, decided to seek fame in California. They {{traveled}} to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts, and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles {{and then on the}} Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They further honed their skills with Morrissey, and blossomed when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, and were quickly spotted by the Paul Whiteman organization. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one {{of the biggest names in}} the entertainment world. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was I've Got the Girl, with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first <b>important</b> <b>job</b> in the entertainment business.|$|E

500|$|Tracy disliked when he {{was asked}} about his technique, or about what advice he would give to others.

[...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!"

500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more <b>important</b> <b>job.</b> With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday I will tell it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} {{has been the}} tradition of having an American head the bank, implemented because the United States provides the majority of World Bank funding.

2500|$|Long {{before the}} advent of the 20th century, mathematicians already {{understood}} that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons. [...] However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., {{as a result of the}} limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral. [...] Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the right abstractions needed to do this <b>important</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
