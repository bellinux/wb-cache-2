25|$|In {{his recent}} book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a {{purposeful}} bouncer and I want it to hurt {{so much that the}} batsman doesn't want to <b>face</b> <b>me</b> any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! The irony of his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Test Jones criticised the Welsh referee Derek Bevan for disallowing a {{try that}} would have won Australia the Test and the series stating, [...] "When David Campese plays badly, he has to <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> Who does Derek Bevan have to answer to?" [...] Jones told the Australian press that Campese's {{mistakes}} [...] "stuck out like a lighthouse in a lily pond", adding, [...] "I {{have a very high}} estimation of David Campese. I hope I don't have to do any revision." ...|$|E
60|$|She swung {{round to}} <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> her dose-set eyes ablaze with anger.|$|E
60|$|I gazed {{about the}} mean room, with its litter of {{newspapers}} and reports, its shabby furniture, and these {{seemed to have}} become incongruous, out of figure in the chair <b>facing</b> <b>me</b> keeping with the thoughtful figure in the chair <b>facing</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|He relinquished his grasp, and <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> in {{the broken}} moonlight.|$|R

60|$|But, try as he would, {{the panel}} would yield neither to cunning nor force, so that {{eventually}} {{he gave it}} up and turned to <b>face</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary (aside). Sandy here, {{and beneath}} this roof! Why has he not sought me? Ah, I know too well: he dare not <b>face</b> <b>me</b> with his child! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard Hiram's voice," [...] Archie said, {{wheeling}} {{about to}} <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> {{for he had}} understood that I would have him believe a stranger had come.|$|E
60|$|She wheeled {{round and}} <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> {{again with a}} little gasp of astonishment.|$|R
60|$|The boy stood <b>facing</b> <b>me,</b> half {{hope and}} half {{uncertainty}} in his look.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head slowly and <b>faced</b> <b>me.</b> I shrank from looking at her.|$|R
60|$|It made {{my blood}} run cold {{to have him}} <b>face</b> <b>me</b> with that vicious look and those glaring eyes. One prod of those horns and all would be over.|$|E
6000|$|... "It had to {{be thrown}} by one of these men near the machine. That {{harvester}} hasn't run twenty feet from where the trick was done.... Let these men <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> I'll find the guilty one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But then, I {{have plenty}} of time," [...] I said agreeably. [...] "And the real {{difficulty}} {{is to get the}} facts to <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> Dear me, if only, now, I had some of Miss Bowater's brains." ...|$|E
60|$|Then she {{straightened}} herself, and, passing behind the chair, stood leaning on it, <b>facing</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{stood up}} too and <b>faced</b> <b>me.</b> I held her {{shoulder}} and looked into her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He had tamed, and now <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> full, very pale, {{but with}} no sign of shrinking.|$|R
6000|$|... "I grant thee pardon," [...] {{said the}} knight, [...] "but tell thee plainly, an thou dost <b>face</b> <b>me</b> so again, I will truly send thee {{to the black}} cell for a week. Now get thee away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{not come}} to bandy words with lawyers," [...] the woman retorted. [...] "I've come to speak to him. Can you <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> Everard Dominey, you who murdered my son and made a madwoman of your wife?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{the son of}} that Samuel Wright who lately {{left home}} to go to Cambridge, and has not yet returned?" [...] the doctor asked, {{releasing}} his hold on Archie's collar that he might wheel about to <b>face</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} <b>faced</b> <b>me.</b> He was {{certainly}} paler {{than he had}} been a few minutes ago.|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the girl}} {{released}} herself, while she <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> with a passionate despair I will never forget.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{declined}} {{the chair to}} which I waved him. He leaned slightly back against the table, <b>facing</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|At the {{announcement}} he straightened suddenly and wheeled round to <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> inquiry in his glance. My mother, too, half rose, and remained so, staring at me, her amazement at seeing me increased by the strange appearance I presented.|$|E
6000|$|... "So! He's the lad you {{believed}} {{might have a}} leaning toward Toryism," [...] Hiram said sharply as he wheeled about to <b>face</b> <b>me,</b> and on the instant I understood that he doubted the truth of Seth Jepson's excuse for leaving the company.|$|E
60|$|As for St. Auban, Vilmorin's flight {{left him}} unequal {{to the task}} of {{dragging}} the girl along. She dug her heels into the ground, and, tug as he might, for all that he set both hands to work, he could not move her. In this plight I came upon him, and challenged him to stand and <b>face</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} he had swung fully around and was <b>facing</b> <b>me.</b> “You’re a preacher, aren’t you?” he asked.|$|R
60|$|I {{drew out}} my tinder-box and lighted the wick. She had turned, and was <b>facing</b> <b>me</b> {{even as she}} had <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> the night before. The night before! The {{greatest}} {{part of my life}} seemed to have passed since then. I remember wondering that she did not look tired. Her face was sad, her voice was sad, and it had an ineffable, sweet quality at such times that was all its own.|$|R
60|$|We {{walked to}} the break of the poop, where she turned and <b>faced</b> <b>me.</b> I glanced around to see {{that no one was}} within hearing distance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The sentiment,' said Mr Rugg, 'is what I {{should have}} {{expected}} from your known principles. It would affect my daughter greatly, sir, if she heard it. As I perceive the mutton, I am glad she didn't hear it. Mr Pancks, on this occasion, pray <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> My dear, face Mr Chivery. For {{what we are}} going to receive, may we (and Miss Dorrit) be truly thankful!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a fair}} proffer," [...] replied Henry; [...] "but gold nor gear {{will never}} buy that harness. I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will not give that mail coat to any one but who will <b>face</b> <b>me</b> for the best of three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon these terms." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{heavier than}} I by many pounds, and so {{weighted}} by the burden he carried that I easily overtook him; {{and at last}} he turned, snarling, to <b>face</b> <b>me.</b> It was Kho of the tribe of Tsa, the hatchet-men. He recognized me, and with a low growl he threw Lys aside and came for me. [...] "The she is mine," [...] he cried. [...] "I kill! I kill!" ...|$|E
60|$|He who <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> was {{a yellow}} man--a little, wizened-up, pasty-faced old fellow with great eyes {{that showed the}} white round the entire {{circumference}} of the iris.|$|R
60|$|She {{bit her lip}} and <b>faced</b> <b>me</b> there, a sweet flushed living thing, with a tear {{coursing}} {{down her}} cheek, and her mouth now firm and steady.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the grand}} {{staircase}} I rushed, burst open {{the pair of}} huge folding doors which <b>faced</b> <b>me,</b> and learned at last that my efforts were in vain.|$|R
