40|$|AbstractSince South Africa {{boasts a}} high {{biodiversity}} of frog species, a multispecies <b>haemoparasite</b> {{survey was conducted}} by screening the blood from 29 species and 436 individual frogs. Frogs were collected at three localities in sub-tropical KwaZulu-Natal, a hotspot for frog diversity. Twenty per cent of the frogs were infected {{with at least one}} of five groups of parasites recorded. Intraerythrocytic parasites comprising Hepatozoon, Dactylosoma, and viral or bacterial organisms, as well as extracellular parasites including trypanosomes and microfilarid nematodes were found. A significant difference (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) in the prevalence of parasitaemia was found across species, those semi-aquatic species demonstrating the highest, followed by semi-terrestrial frog species. None of those species described as purely terrestrial and aquatic were infected. Hepatozoon and Trypanosoma species accounted for most of the infections, the former demonstrating significant differences in intensity of infection across species, families and habitat types (P[*]=[*] 0. 028; P[*]=[*] 0. 006; P[*]=[*] 0. 007 respectively). Per locality, the first, the formally protected Ndumo Game Reserve, had the highest biodiversity of <b>haemoparasite</b> infections, with all five groups of parasites recorded. The other two sites, that is the area bordering the reserve and the Kwa Nyamazane Conservancy, had a lower diversity with no parasite infections recorded and only Hepatozoon species recorded respectively. Such findings could be ascribed to the anthropogenic impact on the latter two sites, the first by the rural village activities, and the second by the bordering commercial sugar cane agriculture. Future studies should include both morphological and molecular descriptions of the above parasites, as well as the identification of potential vectors, possibly clarifying the effects human activities may have on frog <b>haemoparasite</b> life cycles and as such their biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of five avian <b>haemoparasite</b> groups was examined for effects {{on health and}} associations with extrinsic factors. Overall, 786 samples were examined from six sites in two Georgia (USA) watersheds, during breeding and non-breeding periods in 2010 and 2011. Among the four most commonly infected species, Haemoproteus prevalence was significantly higher in Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) compared to Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea) and Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) while prevalence in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) {{was significantly higher than}} in Indigo Buntings. Higher {{prevalence of}} Plasmodium was noted in Tufted Titmice and Northern Cardinals. While Leucocytozoon prevalence was highest in White-throated Sparrows, Trypanosoma prevalence was highest in Tufted Titmice. Interesting differences in infection probabilities were noted between foraging guilds with Haemoproteus associated with low-middle level strata and birds in the middle-upper strata {{were more likely to be}} infected with Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In contrast, ground-foraging birds were more likely to be infected with Leucocytozoon. Breeding season was correlated with higher polychromasia counts and higher prevalence of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In addition, prevalence of infection with certain <b>haemoparasite</b> genera and packed cell volume (PCV) were different among host species. Body mass index was inversely correlated with prevalence of microfilaria infection but positively related to Haemoproteus infection. However, we found no relationship between PCV or polychromasia levels with <b>haemoparasite</b> infection. Molecular characterization of 61 samples revealed 19 unique Haemoproteus (n= 7) and Plasmodium (n= 12) haplotypes with numerous new host records. No differences were noted in haplotype diversity among birds with different migratory behaviors or foraging heights, thus additional studies are needed that incorporate molecular analysis, host biology, and vector biology into comprehensive models on parasite ecology. Detailed morphological examination of these parasites is also necessary to determine if closely related haplotypes represent single species or morphologically distinct, but closely related, haplotypes...|$|E

However, proximate factors modulating the potential trade-off between moult and breeding, such as <b>haemoparasite</b> infection and stress, have not been studied in wild avian populations. We investigated the occurrence of moult-breeding overlap in females of a Spanish population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and its association with female age, <b>haemoparasite</b> prevalences, physiological stress, and condition at initial (incubation phase or beginning of the nestling period) and final breeding stages (days 11 – 12 of the nestling period). Late-breeding females were more likely to show a moult–breeding overlap than early-breeding females. Female age was not associated with moult status when taking into account laying date and study year. A higher proportion of females infected by Haemoproteus at initial breeding stages showed a moult–breeding overlap. Haemoproteus prevalences at final breeding stages did not differ according to moult status. Females with a moult–breeding overlap also showed better condition and lower stress levels (HSP 60 levels) {{at the end of the}} season. A higher proportion of moulting females returned to the breeding grounds in the following season compared with non-moulting ones. Conversely, moulting females showed reduced hatching success and numbers of hatchlings and fledglings.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of haemoplasma infection in these populations, and to identify any correlation with other haemoparasites. Blood was collected from 39 dogs associated with four Aboriginal communities and screened for infection using PCR and serology. DNA was purified and PCR analyses for piroplasms, Anaplasmataceae family bacteria and haemoplasmas performed. Serum was analysed using a commercial <b>haemoparasite</b> ELISA. Prevalence of infection was compared between communities. Results Seventeen dogs (44 %) were infected (PCR positive) with Mycoplasma haemocanis, eight (21 %) with ‘ Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum’, 20 (51 %) with A. platys, and 17 (44 %) with B. vogeli. Two dogs were infected with a novel haemoplasma as determined by DNA amplification and sequencing. Two dogs (5 %) were serologically positive for Dirofilaria immitis antigens, one (3 %) was positive for Ehrlichia canis antibodies and nine (24 nbsp;%) were positive for A. platys antibodies. Co-infections were frequent. Haemoplasma prevalence was highest (73 %, 16 / 22) in Central Australia and lowest (22 %, 2 / 9) in Western Australia (p[*]=[*] 0. 017).

40|$|Non-consumptive {{effects of}} predators {{on each other}} and on prey populations often exceed the effects of direct predation. These effects can arise from fear {{responses}} elevating glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels (predator stress hypothesis) or from increased vigilance that reduces foraging efficiency and body condition (predator sensitive foraging hypothesis); both responses can lead to immunosuppression and increased parasite loads. Non-consumptive effects of invasive predators have been little studied, even though their direct impacts on local species are usually greater than those of their native counterparts. To address this issue, we explored the non-consumptive effects of the invasive red fox Vulpes vulpes on two native species in eastern Australia: a reptilian predator, the lace monitor Varanus varius and a marsupial, the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. In particular, we tested predictions derived from the above two hypotheses by comparing the basal glucocorticoid levels, foraging behaviour, body condition and <b>haemoparasite</b> loads of both native species in areas with and without fox suppression. Lace monitors showed no GC response or differences in <b>haemoparasite</b> loads but {{were more likely to}} trade safety for higher food rewards, and had higher body condition, in areas of fox suppression than in areas where foxes remained abundant. In contrast, ringtails showed no physiological or behavioural differences between fox-suppressed and control areas. Predator sensitive foraging is a non-consumptive cost for lace monitors {{in the presence of the}} fox and most likely represents a response to competition. The ringtail 2 ̆ 7 s lack of response to the fox potentially represents complete naiveté or strong and rapid selection to the invasive predator.

40|$|Abstract Long-term {{field studies}} on {{parasite}} communities are rare but provide a powerful {{insight into the}} ecological and evolutionary processes shaping host–parasite interactions. The aim of our {{study was to identify}} the principal factors regulating long-term trends in the <b>haemoparasite</b> communities of bank voles, and to this end, we sampled three semi-isolated populations of bank voles (n= 880) in 1999, 2002, 2006 and 2010 in theMazury lake district region of NE Poland. Overall, 90. 8 % of the bank voles harboured {{at least one of the}} species of haemoparasites studied. Whilst overall prevalence (all spe-cies combined) did not vary significantly between the surveys, different temporal changes were detected among voles in each of the three sites. In voles from Urwitałt, prevalence increased consistently with successive surveys, whereas in Tałty, the peak years were 2002 and 2006, and in Pilchy, prevalenc...|$|E
40|$|Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are {{considered}} to be an important reservoir for various tick-borne haemoparasites of veterinary importance. In this study we have compared the <b>haemoparasite</b> carrier prevalence in buffalo from four geographically isolated national parks in Uganda [Lake Mburo National Park (LMNP), Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP), Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) and Kidepo Valley National Park (KVNP) ]. Differences were seen in <b>haemoparasite</b> prevalence in buffalo from the four national parks. All the buffalo sampled in LMNP were carriers of Theileria parva however, buffalo from MFNP and KVNP, which are both located in the north of Uganda, were negative for T. parva. Interestingly, 95 % of buffalo {{in the northern part of}} QENP were T. parva positive, however all buffalo sampled in the south of the park were negative. A high multiplicity of infection was recorded in all the buffalo found to be carrying T. parva, with evidence of at least nine parasite genotypes in some animals. Most of the buffalo sampled in all four national parks were carriers of T. mutans and T. velifera, however none were carriers of T. taurotragi, Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Ehrlichia bovis or Ehrlichia ruminantium. All the buffalo sampled from LMNP were positive for T. buffeli and T. sp. (buffalo) however, buffalo from the parks in the north of the country (KVNP and MFNP) were negative for these haemoparasites. Anaplasma centrale and Ana plasma marginale were circulating in buffalo from all four national parks. T. parva gene pools from two geographically separated populations of buffalo in two of the national parks in Uganda (LMNP and QENP) were compared. The T. parva populations in the two national parks were distinct, indicating that there was limited gene flow between the populations. The results presented highlight the complexity of tick-borne pathogen infections in buffalo and the significant role that buffalo may play as reservoir hosts for veterinary haemoparasites that have the potential to cause severe disease in domestic cattle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Theileriosis is a bovine haemoprotozoal {{infection}} {{caused by}} Theileria species. It is a tick transmitted <b>haemoparasite</b> and the disease can develop as clinical or subclinical infections. This study {{was carried out}} in order to determine Theileria infection by Polymerase Chain Reaction in cattle and buffaloes in a National Livestock Development Board farm at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. Forty-one blood samples were collected from the herd of diseased and non diseased cattle and buffaloes. Packed cell volume of each blood sample was analyzed using microcenrifugation which revealed that 85. 7 % (18 / 21) cattle and 20 % (4 / 20) buffaloes had PCV values below the average. White Blood Cell count was calculated using haemocytometer method and 33. 3 % (7 / 21) cattle and 15 % (3 / 20) buffaloes had WBC count above average value.

40|$|Translocation can be {{stressful}} for wildlife. Stress may {{be important}} in fauna translocation {{because it has been}} suggested that it can exacerbate the impact of infectious disease on translocated wildlife. However, few studies explore this hypothesis by measuring stress physiology and infection indices in parallel during wildlife translocations. We analysed faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentration and endoparasite parameters (nematodes, coccidians and <b>haemoparasites)</b> in a critically endangered marsupial, the woylie (Bettongia penicillata), 1 – 3 months prior to translocation, at translocation, and 6 months later. FCM for both translocated and resident woylies was significantly higher after translocation compared to before or at translocation. In addition, body condition decreased with increasing FCM after translocation. These patterns in host condition and physiology may be indicative of translocation stress or stress associated with factors independent of the translocation. Parasite factors also influenced FCM in translocated woylies. When <b>haemoparasites</b> were detected, there was a significant negative relationship between strongyle egg count and FCM. This may reflect the influence of glucocorticoids on the immune response to micro- and macro-parasites. Our results indicate that host physiology and infection patterns can change significantly during translocation, but further investigation is required to determine how these patterns influence translocation success...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine factors associated with occurrence of trypanosomosis in the first generation (F 1) crossbreds between trypanotolerant Orma Boran and trypanosusceptible Teso zebu cattle in a trypanosomosis endemic area in Teso District, western Kenya. The offspring were screened for trypanosomosis and other <b>haemoparasites</b> using parasitological methods. Packed cell volume (PCV), body weights and tsetse density (FTD) were also determined. Factors considered in the analysis included sex, age, body weight and season of the year. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used for multivariable analysis to account for clustering of observations at the animal level and estimate outcome variance parameters. The overall trypanosomosis prevalence was 2. 3 % (n= 477) probably corresponding to low FTD in the area (< 1 fly/trap/day). The risk of trypanosomosis infection was higher in dry than wet season (OR = 5. 4) and in older than younger offspring (OR = 1. 1). The variance parameters obtained indicated that variation of trypanosomosis prevalence lay only at the animal level. Intercurrent <b>haemoparasites</b> detected included Anaplasma marginale, Theileria and Babesia species. Overall, the results suggested that when the tsetse density is very low, control of trypanosomosis in the Orma-Teso zebu offspring in western Kenya require targeting of individual affected animals in the dry seasons...|$|R

40|$|Dogs play an {{important}} role in the lives of humans, and because of this close contact they share with humans, they can serve as sentinels for infections to humans. Rickettsiae are small, obligate intracellular bacteria that are vector-borne and can cause mild to fatal diseases in humans worldwide. There is little information on the zoonotic rickettsial pathogens that may be harboured by dogs from rural localities in South Africa. Thus the primary aim of this study was to identify and characterise rickettsial pathogens infecting dogs using molecular techniques by screening blood samples and ectoparasites collected from domestic dogs in the Bushbuckridge area, Mpumalanga province of South Africa. A total of 141 blood samples, 103 ticks and 43 fleas were collected from owned, free-roaming dogs in the Mnisi community area in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa under the project “Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in dogs” (protocol number: V 033 / 11). Samples were collected from October 2011 through May 2012. Ectoparasites identified are as follows: the tick species include Haemaphysalis elliptica, Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus simus, and an unspeciated Ixodes spp. Fleas includes Ctenocephalides felis strongylus and Echidnophaga gallinacea. DNA was extracted from blood and ectoparasites and screened for the presence of Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Theileria and Babesia species infections using the reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay. Almost half of the blood samples reacted with the genus-specific probes for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma (49 %), and 16 % of the samples investigated were positive for Ehrlichia canis DNA. Babesia rossi (9 %) and Babesia vogeli (4 %) were detected among the 14 % of samples that were positive for the genus-specific probe 1 of Babesia. Furthermore, 14 % of the samples were positive for the genus-specific probes of Theileria/Babesia, 2 % were positive for the genus-specific probe of Theileria, and 1 % for the genus-specific probe 2 of Babesia. <b>Haemoparasite</b> DNA could not be detected in 36 % of the samples investigated. Results of the RLB assay for ectoparasites showed that 30 % of tick pools were positive for the genus-specific probes of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma species, Babesia 1 and 2 (30 %) and Theileria (10 %) while <b>haemoparasite</b> DNA could not be detected in 30 % of the tick pools. <b>Haemoparasite</b> species DNA detected from tick pools includes Neoehrlichia spp., Ehrlichia ruminantium, and Babesia microti. Flea pools were positive for the genus-specific probes of Babesia 1 and 2 (50 %). Specific <b>haemoparasite</b> species were not detected from the flea pools. Rickettsia genus and species-specific qPCR assays were performed to detect zoonotic rickettsiae from DNA obtained from blood and ectoparasite samples. Rickettsiae were not detected in blood samples but in 70 % of tick pools analyzed using a genus-specific qPCR assay, based on the 17 -kD antigen gene. Rickettsial infections were detected in tick pools, namely Haemaphysalis elliptica, Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus simus, and Ixodes, and in flea pools Ctenocephalides felis strongylus and Echidnophaga gallinacea. Using the species-specific assays, three pools of ticks (two Amblyomma hebraeum pools and a Haemaphysalis elliptica pool) tested positive on a R. africae genotype-specific qPCR assay, while flea pools (Ctenocephalides felis strongylus and Echidnophaga gallinacea) were positive on the R. felis qPCR assay. Blast analysis of nucleotide sequences of the V 1 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene of five selected Ehrlichia/Anaplasma positive samples on the RLB hybridization assay revealed an Anaplasma sp. South Africa dog strain 98 % related to Anaplasma phagocytophilum in four of the five samples and an Anaplasma phagocytophilum strain in one sample. Furthermore, Rickettsia massiliae and Orientia tsutsugamushi sequences were also identified in two additional samples. Analysis of nucleotide sequences obtained from tick and flea pool DNA samples positive on R. africae and R. felis qPCR assays revealed Rickettsia africae and Candidatus Rickettsia asemboensis a new Rickettsia felis-like organism respectively. Analysis of nucleotide sequences of the 18 S rRNA gene of three selected B. rossi positive samples on the RLB hybridization assay confirmed detection of B. rossi in all selected samples. The detection of zoonotic rickettsiae in canine blood and their ectoparasites suggests that dogs may play {{an important}} role in the lifecycle of these organisms; these data also provide preliminary information about the diversity of rickettsiae and other vector-borne pathogens circulating in domestic dogs and their ectoparasites in Bushbuckridge, South Africa. In conclusion the detection of zoonotic rickettsiales from blood samples of domestic dogs and their ectoparasites in a rural community in South Africa highlights the potential risk of human infection that may occur from these pathogens.

40|$|Non-human {{primates}} {{serve as}} a model for studies on the dynamics of transmission routes and natural history of diseases shared between humans and animals. The captive environment is conducive the dissemination of zoonotic diseases. Many of these animals do not present clinical symptomatology, even when infected, which characterize them as an important source of infection for domestic animals and man. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sanity of non-human primates kept in captivity through hematological and biochemical analysis as well as peripheral blood smear, aiming to investigate the presence of zoonotic pathogens, serving as a model for future studies on the dynamics of routes of transmission of diseases shared between humans and animals.

40|$|Wildlife, {{especially}} Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), {{are thought}} {{to act as a}} reservoir for many of the important tick-borne pathogens of cattle. In this study, we have determined the prevalence of the most significant tick-borne <b>haemoparasites</b> in wildlife (buffalo, impala, eland and bushbuck) as well as in cattle grazing inside and neighbouring Lake Mburo National Park (LMNP) in Uganda. A high percentage of buffalo were carriers of Theileria parva, Theileria mutans, Theileria velifera, Theileria buffeli and Theileria sp. (buffalo) as well as Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma centrale. The majority of impala sampled were carriers of A. centrale, and all were carriers of an unidentified Babesia/Theileria species. The eland and bushbuck sampled were all carriers of Theileria taurotragi and Theileria buffeli, and the majority were carriers of T. mutans. The bushbuck sampled were also carriers for Erhlichia bovis. There were some differences in the prevalence of <b>haemoparasites</b> between the calves sampled inside and neighbouring LMNP. In order to address the question of whether there is evidence for interbreeding between buffalo-associated and cattle-associated T. parva populations, multi-locus genotypes (MLGs) of T. parva (based on micro-satellite markers) from buffalo and from calves grazing inside and outside LMNP were compared, and the results revealed that buffalo and cattle gene pools were distinct, showing no evidence for transmission of buffalo-derived T. parva genotypes to the cattle population...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>haemoparasites,</b> leptospirosis and Yersinia pestis {{was investigated in}} rodents and shrews from Tanzania, Namibia and Swaziland. Blood smears originating from rodents and shrews from the three countries indicated the presence of Trypanosoma lewisi (72. 7 %) (n= 950), B acillus s pp. 25. 6 % (n= 950), Borrelia sp. (0. 01 % (n= 950) and bipolar cocco-bacilli (0. 01 % (n= 950). The blood smears from Namibia (n= 26) had no <b>haemoparasites</b> while only 1. 33 % (n= 75) of those from Swaziland showed presence of T. lewesi. Leptospira interrogans was found in rodent blood sera from Tanzania in the following serogroup proportions (n= 350) : Icterohaemorrhagiae (10. 29 %), Pomona (2. 86 %), Hardjo (1. 14 %), Bullum (0. 86 %), Grippotyphosa (1. 43 %) and Canicola (1. 14 %). Serodiagnosis of antibodies against the F 1 antigen of Y. pestis using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was negative for all the serum samples from central Tanzania, while two samples of serum from two species of rodents, Rhabdomys pumilio and Gerbilliscus leucogaster, collected in Kavango Region, Namibia were positive. These results suggest an enzootic plague activity in this region in Namibia. It is concluded that zoonotic agents, that are infectious to humans, are prevalent in rodents and shrews in the three countries, and that local communities should apply rodent control measure {{to reduce the risk}} of human infections. </p...|$|R
