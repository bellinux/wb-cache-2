50|$|Jwé {{is a kind}} {{of rural}} music from Saint Lucia, {{performed}} informally at wakes, beach parties, full moon gatherings and other informal events, including débòt dances. Jwé uses raunchy lyrics and innuendos to show off verbal skills, and to express political and comedic commentaries on current events and well-known individuals. One well-known technique that has entered Lucian culture is lang <b>dévivé,</b> which is when the singer says the opposite of his true meaning.|$|E

40|$|Wava Attenuation Device {{made from}} bamboo (APO bambu) {{has been widely}} used to protect {{mangrove}} transplantation area from waves and currents. The use of APO bambu to protect seagrass, however, has not been done much so {{that one of the}} main objectives {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of APO bambu to protect transplanted seagrass in the Labakkang Coast. Seagrass Enhalus acoroides transplantation experiments were conducted on the sites protected by APO bambu and non protected area using three transplantation methods (Staple, Plug, and Frame/TERFS) to find best transplantation method which produced high transplant survival rates. Vegetative shoots (sprigs) of E. acoroides were collected from a healthy donor bed located nearby the plantation site; and planted into unvegetated areas. Test-transplant survival was assessed every two weeks for three months. Transplants planted using the three different planting methods showed significantly different survival rates. Among the three planting methods examined, the Frame method resulted in the highest transplant survival rates both on the site protected by APO bambu (100 %) and non protected site (92, 5 %). The survival rate of seagrass protected by APO bambu was not significantly different from those on the non protected site indicating that APO bambu as a wave attenuation <b>devive</b> used in this study was less effective in protecting the seagrass transplants...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new gallium nitride (GaN) based transistor technology for electronic switching applications. Conventional GaN based transistors {{are of the}} high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) type and are depletion mode devices. These are not suitable for switching applications since an extra DC supply is required to bias the device in the cut-off (off-state) region and the devices are not fail-safe, i. e. incase of malfunction a short-circuit can exist between the main DC supply and ground. Enhancement mode (E-Mode) or normally-off devices can overcome these limitations and if realized in the GaN material system would benefit from the good material properties that support large breakdown voltages and low On-resistances. Fabrication of high performace E-mode GaN devices with low On-resistance and high breakdown voltage still remains a big challenge to date. In this thesis a new method for realizing enhancement mode aluminium gallium nitride - gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN) devices using a localized gate-foot oxidation has been described. Thermal oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer converts the top surface/part of this layer into aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3), which serve as a good gate dielectric and improve the gate leakage current by several orders of magnitude compared to a Schottky gate. The oxidation process leaves a thinner AlGaN barrier which can result in normally o§ operation. Without special precaution, however, the oxidation of the AlGaN barrier is not uniform from the top but occurs at higher rates at the defect/dislocation sites. This {{makes it impossible to}} control the barrier thickness and so rendering the barrier useless. To avoid the problem of non-uniform oxidation, a thin layer of aluminum is first deposited on the barrier layer and oxidized to form aluminium oxide on top. This additional oxide layer seems to ensure uniform oxidation of the AlGaN barrier layer underneath on subsequent further oxidation. Results of the fabricated 2 um x 100 um AlGaN/GaN MOS-HEMTs with a partially oxidized barrier layer showed a threshold voltage of - 0. 5 V (compared to - 3 V for a Schottky <b>devive</b> fabricated on the same epilayer structure) and a maximum drain current of 800 mA/mm at high gate bias of 5 V with very little current compression. The peak extrinsic transconductance of the device is 160 mS/mm at a drain-source voltage of 10 V with a very low specific On-resistance of 9 : 8 ohm. mm 2 and an off-state breakdown voltage higher than 42 V. Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) measurements of Al 2 O 3 /AlGaN /GaN circular test metal-oxide-semiconductor structures were observed and measured. They exhibit no hysteresis, indicating the good quality of the thermally grown aluminium oxide for realizing AlGaN/GaN based E-Mode devices for high frequency and high power applications...|$|E

For this reason, the devices which enables the smaller details to be seen have been developed.

As a result, the <b>devives</b> that are capable of doing operations and analysis in high magnifications with a combination of electron and optic systems have been developed.

40|$|The automatized beat {{detection}} and localization {{have been the}} subject of multiple research in the field of music information retrieval. Most of the methods are based on onset detection. We propose an alternative approach: Our method is based on the “Forward-Backward segmentation”: the segments may be interpreted as attacks, decays, sustains and releases of notes. We process the segment boundaries as a weighted Dirac signal. Three methods <b>devived</b> from its spectral analysis are proposed to find a periodicity which corresponds to the tempo. The experiments are carried out on a corpus of 100 songs of the RWC database. The performances of our system on this base demonstrate a potential in the use of a “ Forward-Backward Segmentation ” for temporal information retrieval in musical signals. 1...|$|R

Various methods and problems about the measurement, control and analysis in sediment hydraulics were discussed {{and some of them}} were improved in this study as follows:(1) Automatic measurements of sediment discharge including direct and indirect methods were improved. Indirect methods consist of sonar and ultra sonic image analyses. (2) A new measurement method of suspended load concentration using continuous pumping and weighing was devised. (3) A new type sand feeder for wet sand was devised. (4) A carriage system driven along arbitrary curves was devised and applied for the experiment on bed variation in a meandering channel.

40|$|Abstract—Remote {{engineering}} (also {{known as}} online engineering) {{may be defined}} as a combination of control engineering and telematics. In this area, specific activities require computacional skills in order to develop projects where electrical <b>devives</b> are monitored and / or controlled, in an intercative way, through a distributed network (e. g. Intranet or Internet). In our specific case, we will be dealing with an industrial plant. Within the last few years, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of activities related to remote engineering, which may be connected to the phenomenon of the large extension experienced by the Internet (e. g. bandwith, number of users, development tools, etc.). This increase opens new and future possibilities to the implementation of advance teleworking (or e-working) positions. In this paper we present the architecture for a remote application, accessible through the Internet, able to monitor and control a roller hearth kiln, used in a ceramics industry for firing materials. The proposed architecture is based on a micro web server, whose main function is to monitor and control the firing process, by reading the data from a series of temperature sensors and by controlling a series of electronic valves and servo motors. This solution is also intended to be a low-cost alternative to other potential solutions. The temperature readings are obtained through K-type thermopairs and the gas flow is controlled through electrovalves. As the firing process should not be stopped before its complete end, the system is equipped with a safety device for that specific purpose. For better understanding the system to be automated and its operation we decided to develop a scale model (100 : 1) and experiment on it the devised solution, based on a Micro Web Server.

Pveliminavy biochemical evidence indicated genetic tvansfev fvom the M° genome of Ae. ventvicosa into some of these Unes. A more detailed biochemical and cytological characteriza tion of the H- 93 - Unes was undertaken. A progress report of these studies is presented here. Fourten biochemical systems, each representing a set of up to 4 homoeologous loci, weve investigated in the vavental material, in the H- 93 - Unes, and in Ae. squavrosa (DD), Ae. comosa (MM) and Ae. uniaristata (M^-M 11). Biochemical markers controlled by the A or B genomes of one or both wheat parents weve distributed in the H- 93 - Unes as expected if the egcells fvom the self-stevile ABDM 0 hybvid, rescued by the ABD polen, cavvied the complete A and B genomes from T. tuvgidum. The distvibution of biochemical mavkevs contvolled by the D genomes of one ov both D genome parents indicated that most of the eggcells from the ABDM 0 hybrid carvied most of the D genome, i. e. 3 out of 8 markers of the former tupe were absent in a few Unes each, ind. icating incomplete homology between the two D genomes, non-homologous transfer or deletion. Biochemical characters present in Ae. ventricosa (DM°), Ae. comosa (M), Ae. uniaristata (M 11) and absent in T. aestivum (ABD), Ae. squarrosa (D) and T. tuvgidum (AB) were selected as M° genome markers. Two of these markers were not transmited to the H- 93 - Unes, three were tvansmitted with low fvequency and one with a high fvequency. Resistance to Erisiphe graminis was determined by Dosba and Doussinault at Rennes and was found to be transmitted with low fvequency. Somatic chromosome numbers of the H- 93 - Unes were counted and all weve found to be hexaploid.
