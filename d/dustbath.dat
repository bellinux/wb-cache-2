50|$|Furnished cages {{provide more}} space than battery cages but still prevent some {{behaviours}} such as vigorous wing-flapping, flying, nest-building (no materials are provided) and inhibit others (comfort or grooming behaviours) determined partly {{by the numbers}} of hens in the cage.The hens are not separated from their feces as completely as hens in battery cages and therefore are at {{a greater risk of}} disease, although not as great as the risk to hens in non-cage systems. The small amount of litter that is provided in furnished cages is often distributed quickly or flicked out the cage, possibly resulting in frustration for hens wishing to <b>dustbath</b> and resulting in sham dustbathing. The nest boxes are often occupied by hens using the box for behaviours other than egg-laying (e.g. for sleeping or sham dustbathing) which could lead to frustration in hens wishing to lay an egg.|$|E
40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of enrichment resources (a perch, <b>dustbath,</b> and nest) layout in furnished laying-hen cages (FC) on exterior quality of eggs. Methods One hundred and sixty-eight (168) Hy-Line Brown laying hens at 16 weeks of age were randomly distributed to four treatments: small furnished cages (SFC), medium furnished cages type I (MFC-I), medium furnished cages type II (MFC-II), and medium furnished cages type III (MFC-III). Each treatment had 4 replicates or cages with 6 hens for SFC (24 birds for each SFC) and 12 hen/cage for MFC-I, -II, and -III (48 birds for each MFC-I, -II and -III). Following a 2 -week acclimation, data collection started at 18 weeks of age and continued till 52 weeks of age. Dirtiness of egg surface or cracked shell as indicators of the exterior egg quality were recorded each week. Results The {{results showed that the}} proportion of cracked or dirty eggs was significantly affected by the FC type (p< 0. 01) in that the highest proportion of cracked or dirty eggs was found in MFC-I and the lowest proportion of dirty eggs in SFC. The results of this showed that furnished cage types affected both dirty eggs and cracked eggs (p< 0. 01). The results also indicated that not nest but <b>dustbath</b> lead to more dirty eggs. Only MFC-I had higher dirty eggs at nest than other FC (p< 0. 01). The results of dirty eggs in MFC-I and MFC-II compared with SFC and MFC-III seemed suggest that a low position of <b>dustbath</b> led to more dirty eggs. Conclusion SFC design affected exterior egg quality and the low position of <b>dustbath</b> in FC resulted in higher proportion of dirty eggs...|$|E
40|$|Since 2012 in the EU, cages for {{the housing}} of laying hens must provide nests, perches and a pecking and {{scratching}} area to promote natural behaviours and enhance animal welfare. Previous studies highlighted {{the difficulty of}} finding adequate materials for pecking and scratching areas in such cages, mainly due to hygiene problems and technical constraints. This study investigates whether alternative materials could stimulate dustbathing (DB), pecking, and scratching behaviours and examines if hens show any preferences for these materials compared to other well-known litter materials such as sand, peat and artificial turf. We set up two separate experiments: one to simultaneously compare four litter materials (wheat bran, sand, shell sand and peat) and one to simultaneously compare four alternative non-litter, pad-type solutions (plastic mat, artificial turf mat, a slightly friable experimental block made of wood and oyster shells, and a slightly friable experimental sand block). For each experiment, 15 groups of four hens were observed over four days in a multiple choice test. Wheat bran was found to promote pecking and scratching behaviours {{better than the other}} litters. Peat induced more <b>dustbaths</b> than wheat bran but duration of DB bouts was similar for both materials. However, the number of <b>dustbaths</b> in wheat bran increased throughout the test, while the duration of DB bouts decreased in peat, showing an increasing preference for wheat bran. The shell sand was found to be the least preferred for pecking, scratching and DB. In the second experiment, pads were found to be less attractive than litters for pecking, scratching, and DB. The plastic mat was very rarely used for DB compared to other solutions in the pad choice test. As hens rarely pecked or scratched any of the pads, no significant differences were noted between the four different types. However, experimental blocks stimulate DB as much as artificial turf mats and seem promising, as their use for DB increased throughout the test. This study shows that wheat bran could be an optimal litter for use in furnished cages to improve hen welfare. In addition, research on new experimental blocks is worth being developed, as it has the advantage of not needing to be renewed during a laying period...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the substrate preference of laying hens {{with respect to}} dustbathing and foraging behaviour, {{in order to determine}} which resources should be provided in laying hen housing systems for the expression of these behaviours. The consumer demand approach was used to study the strength of preference. Hens had to push a weighted door to enter choice pens with either a wire floor, sand, wood shavings or peat moss as substrate. Twelve Isa-Brown hens, reared on battery cages, successfully learned to open the push door. Most of the hens worked for getting access to all choice pens. The slopes of the demand curves for the number of entries to the choice pens were steep and not significantly different. Also no differences were found in the maximum price paid and the total expenditure. These data indicate that {{there seems to be no}} preference for wire or any substrate per se. However, with respect to dustbathing, almost all hens worked for getting access to peat moss to take a <b>dustbath</b> whereas only some hens worked for sand or wood shavings. The slope of the demand curve for dustbathing in peat moss was relatively shallow and the maximum price paid and the total expenditure to take a <b>dustbath</b> in peat moss were significantly higher as compared to dustbathing in sand or wood shavings. With respect to foraging no clear substrate preference was found. We conclude that the value of a particular substrate varies with the behaviour performed in the substrate and that there is a strong demand for peat moss for dustbathing...|$|E
40|$|Dustbathing in {{laying hens}} (Gallus gallus domesticus) serves to remove {{excessive}} feather lipids which accumulate and become stale during dust deprivation. In addition and probably {{as a consequence}} of lipid removal the fluffiness of the downy feather parts is enhanced. A <b>dustbath</b> consists of appetitive tossings and consummatory rubbings. Its function as well as its organization depend {{on the nature of the}} bathing litter. The uninterrupted performance of rubbing is crucial and predicts consistent bathing litter preferences. An increase in stale feather lipids enhances the tendency to bathe, while sham-dustbathing occurs during dust deprivation. However, during long-term deprivation sham-dustbathing develops abnormally. This seems due to intrinsic reinforcement. Long-term deprivation of functional stimulation prescribed by phylogenetical standards may result in an uncontrollable motivation to dustbathe. ...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that thwarting of feeding {{behaviour}} in the laying hen is expressed through a specific vocalisation, the gakel-call. The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the effect of deprivation per se on the occurrence of gakel-calls can be distinguished from the effect of the additional frustration. Frustration is defined as the state of an animal that results from nonreward in the expectancy of reward. The second aim was to investigate whether the occurrence of gakel-calls is restricted to a food context or whether it can be regarded as an expression of frustration in general. For this purpose, 20 hens were deprived of food, water and <b>dustbath.</b> After deprivation at a fixed time, a cue was given and the hens were rewarded with access to food, water or dust during a 15 -min session on 4 consecutive days. On the fifth day, they were thwarted in the associated behaviours by blocking the access to these commodities, after the hens had been presented the signal that previously preceded the reward. We then recorded behaviours that might reflect the state of frustration in three 15 -min periods. The period "Pre-Frustration" started 15 min before "Frustration". This, in turn, was followed by the period "Post-frustration" in which the hens were rewarded again. Nesting behaviour was thwarted by blocking the access to the nest (Frustration) after a hen had reached the last stage of its prelaying behaviour. In the food, water and <b>dustbath</b> context, deprivation elicited gakel-calls. The additional frustration resulted in a higher number of gakel-calls in all contexts except the food context. However, together with the findings of previous experiments, the results of this study suggest that frustration, in general, is expressed through the gakel-call. Frustration in the nest context elicited more gakel-calls than the other contexts. This latter finding is discussed in the light of the occurrence of the gakel-call under natural circumstances...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} substrate preferences of laying hens, with particular respect to dustbathing and foraging behaviour, {{in order to}} guide decisions concerning which resources should be provided in laying hen housing systems to best enable the expression of these behaviours. The consumer demand approach was used to study the strength of preference. Individually-tested hens had to push a weighted door to enter one of four resource areas containing either a wire floor, or sand, wood shavings or peat moss as substrate. The contents of the resource areas were clearly visible from the central home pen. Twelve ISA-Brown hens, reared in battery cages, successfully learned to operate the push door. Most of these hens worked {{to get access to}} all the resource areas. With respect to all visits to the resource areas, the slopes of the demand curves for the numbers of entries to the resource areas were steep and not significantly different. Furthermore, no differences were found in the maximum price paid for access to the various substrates or in the total expenditures. These findings indicate that the hens showed no preference for wire or any other substrate per se. However, when the hens showed dustbathing, almost all of them had worked for access to peat moss whereas only some had worked for sand or wood shavings. The slope of the demand curve for dustbathing in peat moss was relatively shallow and the maximum price paid and the total expenditure to take a <b>dustbath</b> in peat moss were significantly higher than those found for sand or wood shavings. With respect to foraging behaviour we found no clear substrate preference. We conclude that the value of a particular substrate varies according to its suitability for the expression of specific behaviours, {{and that there is a}} strong demand for peat moss for dustbathing...|$|E
