Because of the different difficulties that can complicate a scan's profile interpretation and in order to benefit from the continuous advent of the new technologies in the electronics and the data processing fields, the team of the division of instrumentation and industrial application at the National Centre of Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Techniques conducts a project aiming the elaboration of an expert system for acquisition, processing and interpretation of the data delivered by the gauge used for the Gamma-Ray scanning. This system consists of two main modules. The first one is for the preparation and control of the scans ' progress conditions. The second is developed {{in order to make the}} automatic analysis and interpretation of the scans ' profiles more reliable, easy and effective. In a first step, we have developed software which permits real time control of all the elements that come into play at the time of the realization of an exploration by Gamma-Ray scanning.

40|$|AbstractIn this research, authors {{tried to}} compare {{statistical}} data {{with the results}} of the sociological research which has been carried out by means of qualitative methods, and then to carry out the longitude research concerning installations on education among students of the late 90 s - early 2000 s and to compare to views of modern students. The purpose and problems of research: detection of installations of modern youth in relation to formation as to one of major factors of social mobility in the Kazakhstan society. Define the demands of modern youth to possession professional the knowledge and skills, influencing social positions in society. If one hand changes in form of ownership, differentiation of steps of education are observed, on the other hand there is a reconsideration of value of education and understanding of significance and education role in an everyday life of the person. In the 90 s after break-up of the USSR decrease of number of pupils in system of the higher education is observed, {{and at the end of}} 90 s – the beginning of the 2000 s increases the quantity of higher educational institutions and growth of student's youth. By the present moment the authors carried out the focus group research <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> of modern youth on education and its roles in life of the young Kazakhstan citizens...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of this {{research}} project a concept for quality assurance of lockbolts connec-tions by monitoring the installation process was developed using the parameters installation path and installation force. For this purpose, initially the process capability of selected lockbolt systems was examined by an analytical consideration of the natural scatter <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> curves. Next, the effects <b>of</b> typical <b>installation</b> process irregularities were compared both to the process curve {{as well as on the}} bearing behavior of the joined connection determined numerically and with experimental data. From this it was possible to identify some ranges <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> curve which were effected by installation process irregularities and specific evaluation window are derived. Their implementation enables advanced On-Line - Process monitoring. An advanced process monitoring can be used in addition to the previously customary simple plausibility check for the specific failure diagnosis. Furthermore it is possible by knowledge of the characteristic influence of the irregularities on the bearing behavior, to interrupt the manufacturing process only on the occurrence of critical errors, thus reducing time and cost intensive rework. To reduce the experimental effort special attention was payed to the use of numerical simulation for the automated generation <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> curves to reflect the natural scatter ranges <b>of</b> the real <b>installation</b> process. In conjunction with a sensitivity analysis, the most important influencing variables on the bearing capacities of the joined connection should be identified. Thereby, the procedures for setting up a joining task in SMEs can be optimized, as only the verification <b>of</b> numerically determined <b>installation</b> curves needs to be performed. Requirements for fasteners, installation equipment and installation process monitoring for the prevention and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> process irregularities have been summarized in {{the context of}} a case class concept, which allows the user quality-oriented conception <b>of</b> lockbolt <b>installation</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical assessment <b>of</b> acoustic <b>installation</b> effects characterizing the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility (QFF), an open-jet, anechoic wind tunnel. Several Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) calculations based on equivalent simplistic sources are conducted, enabling the estimation <b>of</b> the <b>installation</b> effects possibly {{induced by the}} QFF environment on the measured acoustic signatures during typical airframe noise experiments. First, the conclusions that had been previously made by the present author in an earlier assessment <b>of</b> QFF <b>installation</b> effects onto the so-called Tandem Cylinder experiments are reproduced. Then, these conclusions are extended to various situations which are more representative of the usual airframe noise tests that are typically conducted in the QFF. In particular, this provides an opportunity to compare the refraction/convection effects of the QFF jet flow to the reflection/diffraction induced by the experimental apparatus. All this further aids in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> acoustic <b>installation</b> effects that may be important {{in the type of}} testing typically done in the NASA/LARC QFF facility...|$|R

Several technologies exist in the market that differs according to vehicle tag type, transponder type, security strategy, cost and operating radio frequency. There are trade-offs with each technology, and very few studies presently exist that evaluate their performance under different conditions. Recent demonstration projects in Europe offer {{a unique opportunity to}} study key issues such as technology-related experiences, transactions, standardization and enforcement. This chapter discusses these experiences while identifying different performance criteria for evaluation. These performance measures are used in a formal evaluation framework based on the ELECTRE IV algorithm to rank different technologies. Such a framework complements the large body of work on congestion pricing, by providing an evaluation framework for streamlining technology investment decisions under different pricing schemes...|$|R
