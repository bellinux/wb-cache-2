25|$|Oyu Tolgoi {{will use}} both {{underground}} and {{open pit mining}} techniques. Initially the mine will process 70,000 tonnes of rock per day, ramping up to 85,000 tonnes from both the open pit and the underground mine (underground mining {{is to be done}} by block caving). The yield from the first phase of mining will be ground through one semi-autogenous <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> (SAG mill). Expansion to new underground areas will result in an additional increase of up to 140,000 tonnes per day with a possible increase to 170,000 tonnes per day.|$|E

25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E

2500|$|The Brisbane central {{business}} district (CBD) lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers [...] and is walkable. Central streets are named after {{members of the royal}} family. Queen Street is Brisbane's traditional main street. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and Queen Street Mall (named in honour of Queen Victoria) and at right angles to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, William). The city has retained some heritage buildings dating back to the 1820s. The Old Windmill, in Wickham Park, built by convict labour in 1824, is the oldest surviving building in Brisbane. The Old Windmill was originally used for the grinding of grain and a punishment for the convicts who manually operated the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill.</b> The Old Windmill tower's other significant claim to fame, largely ignored, is that the first television signals in the southern hemisphere were transmitted from it by experimenters in April 1934—long before TV commenced in most places. These experimental TV broadcasts continued until World War II. The Old Commissariat Store, on William Street, built by convict labour in 1828, was originally used partly as a grainhouse, has also been a hostel for immigrants and used for the storage of records. Built with Brisbane tuff from the nearby Kangaroo Point Cliffs and sandstone from a quarry near today's Albion Park Racecourse, it is now the home of the Royal Historical Society of Brisbane. It contains a museum and can also be hired for small functions. Greater Brisbane had a density of 148 people per square kilometre in 2016. Like most Australian and North American cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Dick Brandon, who drove the engine, felt some nervous strain.

Still he had now a room to himself at the shed where the engine was kept, and a half-breed fireman to help him with the heavier part of his task. He preferred this to living in a hot bunk-house and carrying bags of cement in the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill,</b> though he knew there was a certain risk of his plunging down the ravine with his engine.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, then, I desire {{to say that}} Mrs. Erskine is not dead of a broken heart. Erskine and I and our wives are very much in and out at one another's houses; and I am {{therefore}} {{in a position to}} declare that Mrs. Erskine, having escaped by her marriage from the vile caste in which she was relatively poor and artificially unhappy and ill-conditioned, is now, as the pretty wife of an art-critic, relatively rich, as well as pleasant, active, and in sound health. Her chief trouble, as far as I can judge, is the impossibility of shaking off her distinguished relatives, who furtively quit their abject splendor to drop in upon her for dinner and a little genuine human society much oftener than is convenient to poor Erskine. She has taken a patronizing fancy to her father, the Admiral, who accepts her condescension gratefully as age brings more and more home to him the futility of his social position. She has also, as might have been expected, become an extreme advocate of socialism; and indeed, being in a great hurry for the new order of things, looks on me as a lukewarm disciple because I do not propose to interfere with the slowly <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> of Evolution, and effect the change by one tremendous stroke from the united and awakened people (for such she--vainly, alas!--believes the proletariat already to be). As to my own marriage, some have asked sarcastically whether I ran away again or not; others, whether it has been a success. These are foolish questions. My marriage has turned out much as I expected it would. I find that my wife's views on the subject vary with the circumstances under which they are expressed.|$|E
60|$|When the ore {{is brought}} to the mill, it is ground into an impalpable powder; the process of washing removes all the lighter particles, and {{amalgamation}} finally secures the gold-dust. The washing, when described, sounds a very simple process; but it is beautiful {{to see how the}} exact adaptation of the current of water to the specific gravity of the gold so easily separates the powdered matrix from the metal. The mud which passes from the mills is collected into pools, where it subsides, {{and every now and then}} is cleared out, and thrown into a common heap. A great deal of chemical action then commences, salts of various kinds effloresce on the surface, and the mass becomes hard. After having been left for a year or two, and then rewashed, it yields gold; and this process may be repeated even six or seven times; but the gold each time becomes less in quantity, and the intervals required (as the inhabitants say, to generate the metal) are longer. There can be no doubt that the chemical action, already mentioned, each time liberates fresh gold from some combination. The discovery of a method to effect this before the first grinding would without doubt raise the value of gold-ores many fold. It is curious to find how the minute particles of gold, being scattered about and not corroding, at last accumulate in some quantity. A short time since a few miners, being out of work, obtained permission to scrape the ground round the house and mill; they washed the earth thus got together, and so procured thirty dollars worth of gold. This is an exact counterpart of what takes place in nature. Mountains suffer degradation and wear away, and with them the metallic veins which they contain. The hardest rock is worn into impalpable mud, the ordinary metals oxidate, and both are removed; but gold, platina, and a few others are nearly indestructible, and from their weight, sinking to the bottom, are left behind. After whole mountains have passed through this <b>grinding</b> <b>mill,</b> and have been washed by the hand of nature, the residue becomes metalliferous, and man finds it worth his while to complete the task of separation.|$|E
