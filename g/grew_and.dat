5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence <b>grew,</b> <b>and</b> three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds <b>grew,</b> <b>and</b> a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E
5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain <b>grew</b> <b>and</b> Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England. These were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should they approach the coast, and to deter any enemy landings. As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded {{at a cost of}} £5,660.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious {{as well as the}} political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos. The importance of the temple complex at Karnak (on the east bank of the Nile north of Thebes) <b>grew</b> <b>and</b> the importance of the previous cult of Ra based in Heliopolis diminished.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the park}} were officially {{announced}} in March 1998 and construction began in September of that year.

5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population <b>grew</b> <b>and</b> London's built-up area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions <b>grew,</b> <b>and</b> support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E

There were two platforms, one {{on each side of the}} two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile <b>grew,</b> <b>and</b> his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese counterattack <b>grew</b> <b>and</b> they {{requested}} reinforcements from their higher commander, General Douglas MacArthur. However, the request was denied as MacArthur's intelligence staff believed that there were only 350Japanese in the vicinity. Actually, there were already 5,000Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen while throughout early October this number grew to 12,000 {{as they began to}} prepare for their planned counterattack. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of the}} 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant that the 2/17th, deadlocked around Jivevaneng, could be freed for the advance on Finschhafen, thus enabling the entire 20th Brigade to concentrate on that objective.|$|E

5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness <b>grew</b> <b>and</b> a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely {{documented}} but {{suggests that the}} settlement was established at the junction of Carr Hill Road and the Old Durham Road in the early 19th century alongside the estate of Deckham Hall, built several centuries earlier and inhabited at one time by Thomas Deckham. The village <b>grew,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the turn of}} the 20th century was enveloped by urban spawl when neighbouring Gateshead absorbed its outlying villages and settlements. Deckham is largely distinguished from other areas by a commercial area on Old Durham Road which is the principal route through the suburb. Historically, Deckham was a village in County Durham and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972.|$|E

A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers. Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and South Wales. In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England. Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.|$|E
