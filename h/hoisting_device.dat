2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Charles XII in 1718, and the defeat in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) the Swedish capital was a city in despair, {{preparing}} for a Russian attack and encamped by impoverished, refugees, and idle soldiers. [...] The southern lock {{of the city was}} approaching a century in age, a bottleneck in a state of decay, inadequate for both the larger shipping vessels of the era and the increasing traffic load. [...] While Göran Josuæ Adelcrantz (1668–1739), the pupil and successor of Tessin the Younger, was mostly occupied by the construction works of the new Royal Palace, in 1622 he accomplished an emergency repair of the old lock; workers wading between the temporary embankments filling cracks with clay, straw, and muck, while loose and missing planks were put back in place. These measure not only ended much more expensive than intended but also proved completely insufficient, and as the decay had obviously made the old lock impossible to repair properly, Christopher Polhem (1661–1751), [...] "the father of Swedish mechanics", was consulted for a new construction. The proposal of Adelcrantz for a new construction, estimated to cost 32,741 riksdaler in silver coins, was passed over by a suggested repair of the old lock by Johan Eberhard Carlberg (1683–1773) in 1726, limited in cost to 30,000 rikdaler while implying widening the canal from 6,5 to 8,2 meters, a proposal to the taste of the city's building board which subsequently had Adelcrantz replaced by Carlberg. [...] The latter, however, was a daring man and he quickly produced a proposal for a new lock south of the old, a proposal which implied not only the demolition of the city's brewery, but also the discontinuation of the bar iron deposit next to the lock (the biggest in Europe, representing about 40% of the global market at the time). By 1728, however, the city had accepted the need for a new construction, and, as Carlberg was busy with other undertakings, finally assigned Polhem for the project in 1729. [...] The proposal for a wooden construction he produced the following year didn't please the board which had anticipated a more lasting construction in stone, and as the whole affair failed to conclude, a contract wasn't signed until 1744. [...] At the age of 93 years, only days before his death, Polhem was reward the knighthood of the Royal Order of the Polar Star, {{at the bottom of the}} lock. [...] Finally inaugurated on May 2, 1755, Polhems sluss ("Lock of Polhem"), was 3,9 meters deep, 12,5 meters wide, and 59 meters long; in the western end overpassed by a drawbridge flanked by two brick towers on either side and therefore called Röda Slussen ("The Red Lock"). [...] With the new lock the surrounding area changed considerably in character; on the square south of the lock a triangular block was built, named Strykjärnet ("The [...] Iron"); several old wooden buildings were replaced by new in stone; and an eastern bridge was added over the canal named Blå Slussen ("The Blue Lock") after the blue <b>hoisting</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

The compensation would then be performed by the <b>hoisting</b> <b>device</b> (Drawworks), that would pay out or feed in wire according to estimated rig position in according to seabed. The technology of doing compensation prior to the actual change in weight ensures low fluctuations and better control for both the position and the weight on bit(WOB).|$|E
50|$|In this Leg's Detour, teams chose {{between two}} {{mountain}} rescue tasks: Search and Rescue. In Search, teams used {{a set of}} avalanche beacons to search the Matterhorn for a dummy buried in the snow; they then had to dig out the whole dummy before they could receive their next clue. In Rescue, teams used a special <b>hoisting</b> <b>device</b> to rescue a mountaineer trapped in a crevasse. One team member had to lower his or her teammate into the crevasse; the lowered teammate then had to attach a carabiner to the mountaineer. The teammate at the top then had to raise the pair back to the surface; once at the top, the rescued mountaineer would give them their next clue.|$|E

50|$|Demag Cranes AG is a German heavy {{equipment}} manufacturer now controlled by US based Terex. The roots of Demag date back {{prior to its}} formation, but became Märkische Maschinenbau-Anstalt, Ludwig A.-G in 1906 as the biggest crane building company in Germany employing 250-300 people. The company was a manufacturer of industrial cranes that included types like, bridge cranes, <b>hoist</b> (<b>device),</b> overhead cranes, Gantry crane to name a few. In 1910 came the hour of the Deutsche Maschinenfabrik in Duisburg - known worldwide by its telegram abbreviation Demag (now Demag Cranes & Components GmbH). In 1973 The Mannesmann group assumed ownership of Demag. Since that time the company has continued to grow and change. Parts of the company under core business structuring moved from its ownership to focus the main concept of the company.|$|R

Frants Lichtenberg was also working as an inspector for the federal government of Canada at the time. Immediately, fears of German sabotage were reported but it was soon clear that another tragic construction accident had befallen the structure (a problem with the <b>hoisting</b> <b>devices).</b> Re-construction began almost immediately after the accident and special permission granted for the bridge builders to acquire the steel that was in high demand because of the War effort. The fallen central span still lies {{at the bottom of the}} river. After the bridge's completion in 1917, special passes were required for those wanting to cross the structure. Armed soldiers, and later Dominion Police, guarded the structure and checked passes until the end of the War.|$|R

40|$|Quite {{a number}} of studies, such as those by Íñiguez (1963, pp. 193 - 211), García Tapia (1990, pp. 172 - 181) and Lorda (1997), have {{discussed}} the cranes used {{in the construction of}} Spanish Renaissance buildings. All these papers deal with the surviving evidence about the construction of the Escorial complex, in particular the main church or basilica, such as a large number of contracts and other documents, a manuscript by Juan de Herrera called Architectura y machinas, and the outstanding drawing of the Escorial building site now at Hatfield House, England. Another source for studies about Spanish Renaissance cranes is Lázaro de Velasco’s translation of Vitruvius’ De architectura libri decem. Velasco was the grandchild of a wood carver, Juan López de Velasco, and the son of Jacopo Torni, a Florentine painter and sculptor who was master mason of Murcia cathedral and architect of the church of San Jerónimo in Granada. Velasco followed an ecclesiastical career, holding a post as beneficiado in the chapter of Granada cathedral. However, his artistic interests show up in his work as illuminator of choir books, in his ill-fated attempt to obtain the office of master mason for Granada Cathedral in 1577 and in his complete translation of Vitruvius into Spanish, about 1564. Of course, Velasco translates the passages of Vitruvius’ tenth book about machines, such as the tryspast and the polyspast, adding drawings of these <b>hoisting</b> <b>devices.</b> Furthermore, Velasco interpolates a long passage describing a big crane, similar but not identical to the ones in the Escorial, with a pyramidal frame, a windlass or mástil, moved by men treading inside a wheel, a rotating pole, ropes and a tryspast, but does not furnish a drawing of this big, non-Vitruvian crane. After a brief review of Velasco’s career, I shall try to reconstruct the big crane in Lázaro de Velasco’s text, comparing it with the Escorial cranes, as depicted in the Hatfield drawing and described in the studies of Íñiguez, García Tapia and Lorda. I shall also discuss the possible sources of Lázaro de Velasco expertise on cranes; on the one hand, classical sources such as Vitruvius or Greek mechanics, on the other, the traditional and empirical lore of carpenters and masons, embodied in the ingenio or crane put up in Murcia cathedral in the years of Jacopo Torni, or the cranes that Velasco may have seen in Granada cathedral...|$|R
