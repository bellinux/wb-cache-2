Tannic acid has {{astringent}} properties, due to its capacity to form protein&ndash;macromolecular complexes, as well as antibacterial and antioxidant properties. However, little is known about its anti-inflammatory properties. Purpose: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> by quantifying the suppression of key molecules produced during inflammatory events in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated human intestinal cells. Methods: Intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) expression was determined by Western blot analysis; interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in Caco- 2 cells 24 hours after treatment with LPS (1 &mu;g/mL) in presence of different concentrations of <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate.</b> Results: ICAM- 1 is induced {{on a wide variety of}} cells by inflammatory stimuli such as LPS. Our results have shown <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> as a potent inhibitor of ICAM- 1 expression in LPS-stimulated Caco- 2 cells. IL- 8 and TNF-&alpha; are important inflammatory mediators, recruiting neutrophils and T-lymphocytes. Together with LPS, adding <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> at different concentrations induced a dose-dependent inhibition of IL- 8 and TNF-&alpha; released by Caco- 2 cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the specific cytokines and adhesion molecules involved in several inflammatory disorders.

40|$|A 4. 5 -month-old {{baby girl}} {{presented}} to {{hospital with a}} 2 -day history of watery diarrhea and fever. Rehydration and electrolytic balance were restored with intravenous fluid therapy followed by oral rehydration solution but diarrhea did not improve by the fourth day of hospitalization despite treatment with a probiotic. The patient was next treated with <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate,</b> a medical device recently marketed in Europe to control and reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in infants, children, and adults. The child’s diarrhea improved considerably within the first twelve hours and resolved completely within three days. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> might {{be considered as a}} useful treatment complementary to oral rehydration solution for the treatment of diarrhea in infants with rotavirus gastroenteritis...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{diarrhea}} is a {{very common}} symptom, which may recognize different causes and is basically the expression of an altered homeostasis of the bowel, which overcame current classifications. When approaching patients with acute diarrhea, we should firstly check body temperature and vital parameters and secondly provide a general medical examination mainly focused on the abdomen, in order to exclude surgical causes of diarrhea, such as acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, intestinal occlusion and others. Another important aspect is {{the assessment of the}} level of hydration in order to provide the right amount of fluids. There is no current indication for the administration of loperamide in infectious diarrhea, but there is a strong rationale for new class of drugs, which may be defined as "mucous regenerators", such as <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate.</b> Further studies are needed on this matter in order to test the effect of <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> in adult patients with acute diarrhea...|$|E

40|$|The {{intestinal}} barrier serves 2 critical {{functions for}} the survival of the individual: first, it allows nutrient absorption and second, it defends the body from dangerous macromolecule penetration. It is a complex multilayer system, consisting of an external "anatomic" barrier and an inner "functional" immunological barrier. The interaction of these 2 barriers enables equilibrated permeability to be maintained. Many factors can alter this balance: gut microflora modifications, mucus layer alterations, and epithelial damage can increase intestinal permeability, allowing the translocation of luminal content to the inner layer of intestinal wall. Several techniques are now available that enable us to study gut permeability: "in vitro" models (Caco- 2 and HT 29 -MTX cells) and "in vivo" not invasive tests (sugar tests and radioisotope scanning tests) are used to estimate permeability and to suggest molecular pathophysiological mechanisms of intestinal permeability in health and diseases. Many medicinal products used in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases have also found to play an active role in modulate intestinal permeability: corticosteroids, 5 -aminosalicylic acid, anti-tumor necrosis factor, probiotics, and mucosal protectors, like <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate.</b> This review will particularly address the role of the gut barrier in maintaining intestinal permeability (microbiota, mucus, and epithelial cells), the techniques used for estimating intestinal permeability and the therapeutic approaches able to modify it...|$|E
40|$|In their {{review of}} <b>gelatin</b> <b>tannate</b> (GT) Ruszczyński et al [1] {{extensively}} explain tannic acid (TA) activity {{and they may}} {{give the impression that}} TA is responsible for the mechanism of action of GT and also responsible for the possible adverse effects of the product. Various in vivo studies have demonstrated that GT is a stable complex not dissociated in the small intestine. Therefore any reference to the TA, in this case, is not justified. L. Bueno has presented at the 21 st UEG Week 2013 in Berlin [2] a review of the in vitro studies regarding the mechanism of action of GT and the results of his own in vivo investigations confirming that there is no dissociation of GT. Indeed, the in vivo studies performed to confirm the mechanical film forming activity of the stable complex between gelatin and TA have been done by Bueno et al in the prestigious center of INRA in Toulouse. The results of the study showed that 6 h after LPS injection, both jejunal TJ permeability and MPO activity were dramatically increased in rats. Oral pretreatment with GT reduced the jejunal increase of permeability by 78. 1 %, whereas gelatin as well as TA did not affect it. The conclusion was that only the stable complex between gelatin and TA has the potential to form a biofilm and to offer the activity of GT [2]. The conclusions of in vitro and in vivo testing are that GT acts by mechanical protection of the mucosa and that the therapeutic activity of GT is linked exclusively to its undissociated form, the only one present at the intestinal level [2]...|$|E
