5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and {{it can only be}} made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were monophyletic, demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the methods used to determine the confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E

5000|$|Time {{consistency}} is also {{a property}} in financial risk related to dynamic risk measures. The purpose of the time consistent property is to categorize the risk measures which satisfy the condition that if portfolio (A) <b>is</b> more <b>risky</b> than portfolio (B) {{at some time in}} the future, then it is guaranteed to <b>be</b> more <b>risky</b> at any time prior to that point. This is an important property since if it were not to hold then there is an event (with probability of occurring greater than 0) such that B <b>is</b> <b>riskier</b> than A at time [...] although it is certain that A <b>is</b> <b>riskier</b> than B at time [...] As the name suggests a time inconsistent risk measure can lead to inconsistent behavior in financial risk management.|$|R

25|$|Keloid scars {{can occur}} on anyone, {{but they are}} most common in dark-skinned people. They {{can be caused by}} surgery, accident, acne or, sometimes, body piercings. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a {{cosmetic}} problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the shoulders and chest. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention. Surgical removal of keloid <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.|$|E

25|$|A chip kick {{can be used}} to put {{the ball}} behind the {{defensive}} line so that either the kicker himself or a teammate can chase or regather it. Sometimes the kicker himself will attempt to regather after an extremely short chip kick over or past the defenders whilst running towards them. Upon kicking, a player is deemed to have relinquished possession of the ball and thus may not be tackled or interfered with by the defence. The kicker's already-existing momentum as he runs towards the opposition's in goal area gives him an advantage over defenders who must turn and chase. However this chip and regather <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> as it is difficult to perform successfully and good defending fullbacks will usually be lurking behind the defensive line, waiting for just this type of kick.|$|E

500|$|Despite their ferocity, {{adults are}} nectarivores, {{consuming}} [...] honeydew (a sweet, sticky liquid found on leaves, deposited from various insects), nectar, and other sweet substances. The larvae, however, are carnivorous. After they reach a certain size, they are fed insects that foragers capture and kill. The workers also regurgitate food for other ants to consume. Young ants are rarely fed food regurgitated by adults. Adult workers prey {{on a variety}} of insects and arthropods, such as beetles, caterpillars, earwigs, Ithone fusca moths, Perga saw flies, and spiders. Other prey include invertebrates such as bees, cockroaches, crickets, wasps and other ants; in particular, workers prey on Orthocrema ants (a subgenus of Crematogaster) and Camponotus, although this <b>is</b> <b>risky</b> since these ants are able to call for help through chemical signals. Slaters, earthworms, scale insects, frogs, lizards, grass seeds, possum feces and kangaroo feces are also collected as food. Flies such as the housefly and blowfly are consumed. Some species, such as M. pilosula, will only attack small fly species and ignore larger ones. Nests of the social spider Delena cancerides are often invaded by M. pyriformis ants, and nests once housing these spiders are filled with debris such as twigs and leaves by the workers, rendering them useless. These [...] "scorched earth" [...] tactics prevent the spiders competing with the ants. M. gulosa attacks Christmas beetles, but workers later bury them.|$|E

[...] Nick Catucci of The Village Voice called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and compared Blink-182 to fellow pop punk band Green Day's 2000 effort, Warning, writing, [...] "Let it be noted, however, that Warning searches for subject matter where Blink-182 searches for meaning."

500|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals the}} story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a simple Jat boy, from Delhi. He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the one thing is common among all artists, singers, painters, etc., is 'pain,' especially, via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't {{be able to reach}} his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. JJ accidentally sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called [...] "Shut Up & Dance" [...] when he and his friends go to venue, where the contest is about to start. He goes inside only to see this girl's performance, even though he initially refuses to go inside the auditorium. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a Kashmiri Pandit from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the [...] "perfect heartbreaking machine". Since JJ wanted to succeed, and he remembers the word of Khatana telling him that pain, especially from heartbreak, is the way to become an artist, he decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time, JJ and Heer will become good friends, often going on fun, nasty, naughty, and spicy adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks <b>is</b> <b>risky.</b>|$|E
