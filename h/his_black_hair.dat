5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found burdensome. Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E
25|$|Jochanaan {{emerges from}} the cistern and shouts prophecies {{regarding}} Herod and Herodias that no one understands, except Salome when the Prophet refers to her mother. Upon seeing Jochanaan, Salome is filled with an overwhelming desire for him, praising his white skin and asking to touch it, but he rejects her. She then praises <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to hear this, kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|I {{was well}} placed at table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E
50|$|Irish berserker Slaine Mac Roth is {{well known}} for <b>his</b> spiked <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Dough for the Do-Do, Moe has blond hair. In Porky in Wackyland, he has <b>his</b> {{original}} <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Petroff smiled, {{and shook}} back <b>his</b> <b>black</b> curly <b>hair,</b> as a lion might in {{sporting}} with an obstinate cub.|$|R
500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E
2500|$|Working as both screenwriter and {{assistant}} director on Rossellini’s Paisà (Paisan) in 1946, Fellini was entrusted to film the Sicilian scenes in Maiori. In February 1948, {{he was introduced}} to Marcello Mastroianni, then a young theatre actor appearing in a play with Giulietta Masina. Establishing a close working relationship with Alberto Lattuada, Fellini co-wrote the director’s Senza pietà (Without Pity) and Il mulino del Po (The Mill on the Po). Fellini also worked with Rossellini on the anthology film L'Amore (1948), co-writing the screenplay and in one segment titled, [...] "The Miracle", acting opposite Anna Magnani. To {{play the role of}} a vagabond rogue mistaken by Magnani for a saint, Fellini had to bleach <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> blond.|$|E
60|$|The man at {{the piano}} bowed. <b>His</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> heaved upon his skull like seaweed in a ground swell.|$|E
50|$|Easily {{identifiable}} on {{the field}} due to <b>his</b> flowing <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and determined aggression, Alvin was recruited by Carlton from the Bairnsdale Football Club in the Latrobe Valley Football League.|$|R
60|$|At first Ishmael {{had shrunk}} beneath this torrent of invective, but {{the threat of}} {{violence}} roused his fierce nature. His face grew evil, and <b>his</b> long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and beard bristled with wrath.|$|R
60|$|Carrier's pallor {{was of a}} grey-green {{from the}} rage that possessed him. <b>His</b> <b>black</b> eyes smouldered like those of an animal seen in the gloom, and <b>his</b> tumbled <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> {{fluttering}} about <b>his</b> moist brow, increased the terrific aspect of his countenance. Marc Antoine shrank and was dumb.|$|R
60|$|Halfoff paused. He was panting and {{his chest}} heaved. There was {{perspiration}} {{on his face}} and <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was wet.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Bateman hated his {{greatest}} friend. Eva {{got up from}} the table and with much laughter placed the wreath on <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{there had}} {{suddenly}} appeared before Humpendinck {{the form of}} the dunce, hatless and with <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> tumbled over his face in all directions.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Peter Care and shot on location in a Berkshire cornfield. This is the last video which presents Dave Gahan with blonde hair, after that he returned to <b>his</b> natural <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{feel as if}} it {{were burning}} into me,' thought Siegmund abstractedly. 'It is {{certainly}} consuming some part of me. Perhaps it is making me ill.' Meanwhile, perversely, he gave his face and <b>his</b> hot <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> to the sun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Delicious!" [...] {{said the}} tired soldier, {{kneeling}} over the spring, scooping {{it up in}} his hand to drink, opening his collar, and bathing hands and face in the clear cool fountain, till <b>his</b> long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> hung straight, saturated with wet.|$|R
60|$|He toyed sorrowfully {{with the}} red ribbon in <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and Crispin, seeing that no fresh stake was forthcoming, made shift to rise. But the coxcomb {{detained}} him.|$|E
60|$|Thirlwell {{glanced at}} the figure rudely {{outlined}} by the dirty blue blanket on the bunk. Driscoll's face was turned to the wall, but Thirlwell saw that <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was damp.|$|E
60|$|When the {{soldiers}} found him, three hours later, {{he was lying}} with his face over his arm, <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> giving off heat under the sun. But he was still alive. Seeing the open, black mouth the young soldiers dropped him in horror.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A healing {{against the}} shadow of death,' said Kim, mixing the Kamboh's flour with the mingled {{charcoal}} and tobacco ash in the red-earth bowl of the pipe. E, without a word, slipped off his turban and shook down <b>his</b> long <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Another {{motionless}} form lay beyond Chance and Culver. It {{was that}} of a slight man, flat on his back, his arms wide, <b>his</b> long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> in the dust. Under the white level brow the face had been crushed into a bloody curve.|$|R
50|$|Remnants {{of paint}} survive in many places, {{particularly}} Zeus' red-brown tunic with dark brown {{lines at the}} edges and <b>his</b> <b>black</b> beard, <b>hair</b> and hat. The god stands on an architectural base {{in the shape of}} a gable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasure!" [...] he cried. [...] "Pleasure! Look at this!" [...] He {{pulled off}} his hat, and I saw that <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> was all decked and dashed with streaks of grey. [...] "Do you imagine that this came from pleasure?" [...] he asked, with a bitter laugh.|$|E
60|$|Siegmund came bareheaded, <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> ruffling to the wind, {{his eyes}} shining warmer than the sea-like cornflowers rather, his limbs {{swinging}} backward and forward like the water. Together they {{leaned on the}} wall, warming the four white hands upon the grey bleached stone as they watched the water playing.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two after he was gone Suzanne and Caron stood confronting each other in silence. She seemed smitten with a sudden awkwardness, and she looked away from him what time he waited, hat in hand, the chill morning breeze faintly {{stirring}} a loose strand of <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have bathed?' she said, smiling, {{and looking}} at <b>his</b> damp, ruffled <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> She shrank from his eyes, but he was quite unconscious.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lassen thereupon {{hung his}} hat upon a peg, removed his overcoat, {{straightened}} his white tie {{with the aid}} of a looking-glass, brushed back <b>his</b> glossy <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> with the palms of his hands, and took the seat opposite Laverick. His first question was inevitable.|$|R
50|$|Dennis is {{the main}} {{character}} of the strip. Badly behaved and visually rebellious, Dennis uses {{a wide range of}} pranks and weaponry in order to cause chaos and mayhem to those around him. He is trademarked by <b>his</b> scruffy, <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and red & black jersey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I speak simple truth,' bluntly {{answered}} James, {{running his}} hand through <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> to the ruin of the morning smoothness, so that it, {{as well as the}} whole of his quick, dark countenance seemed to have undergone a change from sunny south to stormy north in the few moments since his first appearance.|$|E
60|$|His {{black eyes}} flashed {{out of a}} swarthy face nearly covered with beard; his soft hat had fallen off when the captain struck him, and <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> stood up like {{bristles}} on a shoe-brush. He was not a large man; he wore a loose woolen jacket; his sleeves were short, and his hands were hairy.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect was}} electric. A stir ran, like a ripple over water, across that froth of upturned human faces, and completest silence followed. In that great silence {{they looked at}} this slim young man, hatless, long wisps of <b>his</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> {{fluttering}} in the breeze, his neckcloth in disorder, his face white, his eyes on fire.|$|E
60|$|He was a fine, {{athletic}} {{youth of}} pleasant countenance, mounted upon a spotted pony {{and wearing a}} shirt of purple calico. With a belt of silver disks around his waist and a fillet of green cloth binding <b>his</b> glossy <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> he was distinctly and delightfully colorful.|$|R
6000|$|But the {{musician}} was standing fixed, {{as if in}} great perplexity. Thrusting his hand into <b>his</b> forest of <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> he murmured, 'Surely it is the same--surely!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Burton Ellis's handsome, boyish {{face flushed}} darkly crimson {{to the roots}} of <b>his</b> curly <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> Something in the father's tone roused anger and {{rebellion}} in the son. He straightened himself up from the turnip row he was hoeing, looked his father squarely in the face, and said quietly, ...|$|R
