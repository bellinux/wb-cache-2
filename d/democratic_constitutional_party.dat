The party was rumored to be lead by the then outlaw Calderonistas who lost the war, but although most of its members were relatives of Calderonistas they never held offices during Calderon's party government and were allowed to participate, to the point that even the Electoral Court gave them an extension to end the conformation of the party thanks to then president Otilio Ulate intervention. The party was the second political force in the Costa Rican Constituent Assembly and also in the following Costa Rican general election, 1949.|$|E
