40|$|All modern nations face {{problems}} of religious toleration and respect. Examining the US constitutional tradition of religious free exercise and non-establishment, I {{argue that the}} core value in this tradition is that of equal respect for conscience, a value that militates against all governmentally-created hierarchies or 'in-groups. ' I argue that this tradition is on the whole a helpful guide in thinking about such issues more generally. On the 'free exercise' side, I argue for a doctrine of 'accommodation' that gives dispensations from generally applicable laws on grounds of conscience. On the 'non-establishment' side, I look at issues of public displays, school prayer, and public funding, arguing that {{the key question is}} whether the policy in question makes a statement of endorsement or disendorsement, creating preferred and dispreferred classes of citizens.

40|$|In recent years, the United States Supreme Court {{has shown}} an {{increasing}} unwillingness {{to engage in}} deciding matters {{that relate to the}} interpretation of religious practice and belief. While the Justices have articulated valid concerns concerning these cases, courts should not allow these concerns to deter them from making decisions vital to the effective adjudication of Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clause cases. In fact, it appears {{that as a result of}} the Court 2 ̆ 7 s increasing refusal to consider carefully the religious questions central to many cases, the Court often tends to group together religious claims and practices, regardless of the relative validity or importance of a particular practice within a religious system. This approach may lead to a number of disturbing results, some of which have already evidenced themselves in Supreme Court decisions in both Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clause cases. In Free Exercise Clause cases, grouping together all religious claims may require courts to accept and protect to the same degree all claims which appear to have a basis in religious belief. Courts may thus lose the ability to reject claims of relatively minor or even questionable religious significance. In such cases, courts may grant unnecessary and improper protections and exemptions to professed adherents, resulting in potential burdens on the government and society as a whole that could otherwise be avoided. Finally, the various dangers in both Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clause jurisprudence may be exacerbated by the fact that the Supreme Court has continuously broadened the range of the kinds of religious questions it refuses to consider. If courts continue to evade deciding these religious questions, their approach will perpetuate the unfortunate results that are already evident in a number of Supreme Court decisions. Levine concludes that the Supreme Court should reexamine the results of its Religion Clause jurisprudence, and adopt a willingness to consider more carefully questions of religious practice and belief...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{deals with}} the {{controversy}} surrounding the teaching of evolutionary theory in American public schools, with a specific focus on disclaimers read by teachers before they teach evolution. With the rise of religious fundamentalism and the correspondent change in the American socio-legal climate, questions of religion and interpretation of the Religion Clauses of the U. S. Constitution have become increasingly pertinent. In particular, the precise relationship between the Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clauses is of special importance with religious groups now more vocal in their articulation of their free exercise rights. The current form of disclaimer either mentions specific religious theories about origins as alternatives to evolution, or denigrates evolutionary theory in more indirect ways. Because such disclaimers are clearly antithetical to the neutrality concerns of the Establishment Clause, they have been held unconstitutional by all courts to date, including the December 2005 Kitzmiller case in Dover, Pennsylvania. However, this Article suggests that striking down the disclaimers without providing alternative responses to the legitimate free exercise concerns involved may violate the Free Exercise Clause. As a way of negotiating free <b>exercise</b> and <b>establishment</b> concerns, this Article proposes a generalized disclaimer: {{one that does not}} single out evolutionary theory for special treatment, but rather addresses scientific inquiry as a whole. Generalized disclaimers neither discriminate among religion, or between religion and non-religion, or between scientific theories. This Article will then go on to discuss whether such generalized disclaimers can ever be constitutional, despite their origins in the evolution controversy. That is, are they poisoned by their roots, or can they be purged of this poison if they become sufficiently neutral in form? This Article will conclude that the formally neutral generalized disclaimers should be upheld on constitutional grounds...|$|R

40|$|When {{should we}} {{accommodate}} religious practices? When should we demand that religious groups instead conform {{to social and}} legal norms? Who should make these decisions, and how? These questions lie {{at the very heart}} of our contemporary debates in the field of Law and Religion. Particularly thorny issues arise where religious practices may impose health-related harm to children within a religious group or to third parties. Unfortunately, legislators, scholars, courts, ethicists, and medical practitioners have not offered a consistent way to analyze such cases and the law is inconsistent. This Article suggests that the lack of consistency is a troubling artifact of our political system, and further, that it raises serious constitutional questions that lie at the intersection of the Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> clauses of the First Amendment. To resolve these problems, we propose and develop a test to determine whether such a religious practice should be accommodated by legislators, courts, and medical practitioners. Our test is sensitive to the institutional strengths and weaknesses of differently-situated decision-makers, and is designed to be flexible enough to account for these differences. Consequently, it has distinctive applications for legislators, administrative officials, judges, and medical practitioners. Further, although the test was developed specifically to address religious practices that may impose health-related harms to children and third-parties, it also has potential implications in other contexts as well, such as the debates over sexual orientation non-discrimination laws should accommodate religious dissent...|$|R

40|$|My goal in {{this piece}} is to surface some of the commonalities between {{religious}} belief liberty and sexual orientation identity liberty and to offer some public policy suggestions for {{what to do when}} these liberties conflict. I first want to make transparent the conflict that I believe exists between laws intended to protect the liberty of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (2 ̆ 2 LGBT 2 ̆ 2) people so that they may live lives of dignity and integrity and the religious beliefs of some individuals whose conduct is regulated by such laws. I believe those who advocate for LGBT equality have downplayed the impact of such laws on some people 2 ̆ 7 s religious beliefs and, equally, I believe those who have sought religious exemptions from such civil rights laws have downplayed the impact that such exemptions would have on LGBT people. Second, I want to suggest that the best framework for dealing with the conflict between some people 2 ̆ 7 s religious beliefs and LGBT people 2 ̆ 7 s identity liberty is to analyze religious people 2 ̆ 7 s claims as belief liberty interests under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, rather than as free exercise claims under the First Amendment. There were important historical reasons for including the First Amendment in our Constitution, with its dual Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clauses.

40|$|In each of {{the past}} four terms, the United States Supreme Court has decided a case with {{important}} implications for the interpretation and application of the Religion Clauses of the United States Constitution: Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church 2 ̆ 6 Sch. v. EEOC, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Inc., Holt v. Hobbs, and, most recently, Zubik v. Burwell. Although the Court’s decisions in these cases addressed—and seemed to resolve—a number of questions central to Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clause jurisprudence, including recognition of the “ministerial exception” and religious rights of a corporate entity, the decisions left a number of questions unanswered, such as the contours of free exercise rights for prisoners and the definition of a religious minister. More dramatically—though anticlimactically—in Zubik, rather than ruling in favor of one of the parties, the Court issued an unusual per curiam opinion instructing the parties to work {{to find a way to}} resolve the matter. This article suggests that the Supreme Court’s inability to answer some of these questions, or even to resolve the controversy in Zubik, is rooted in the Court’s continuing, and arguably expanding, hands-off approach to religious doctrine. Courts and scholars have offered sound justifications for the Supreme Court’s hands-off approach to questions of religious doctrine grounded in constitutional principles of religious freedom as well as more general concerns over judicial competence and the role of judges. Nevertheless, as recent cases have illustrated, the hands-off approach raises concerns of its own, at times serving as a source of contention and confusion. The ongoing tensions and divisions among Justices and judges revolving around these issues may suggest a need for the Supreme Court to revisit and perhaps rethink the contours of the hands-off approach to achieve clarity for the future...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{with its}} fumbling of late {{when dealing with}} cases {{involving}} religion, the U. S. Supreme Court has taken to reciting the metaphor of play in the joints between the Religion Clauses. This manner of framing the issue before the Court presumes that the Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clauses run in opposing directions, and indeed will often conflict. It then becomes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s task, as it sees it, {{to determine if the}} law in question falls safely in the narrows where there is space for legislative action neither compelled by the Free Exercise Clause nor prohibited by the Establishment Clause. The conception that the free-exercise and no-establishment texts are in frequent tension, and at times are in outright war with one another, is quite impossible. Each substantive clause in the first eight amendments to the Bill of Rights was designed to anticipate and negate the assumption of certain powers by the national government - a government already understood to be one of limited, enumerated powers. Thus, for example, the free-speech clause further limited national power and the free-press clause did so as well. These two negatives on power - speech and press - can overlap and thus reinforce one another but they cannot conflict. Simply put, it is logically impossible for two negations of a government 2 ̆ 7 s delegated power to conflict. Similarly, the free-exercise provision further restricted the nation 2 ̆ 7 s powers and no-establishment did likewise. These two negatives can overlap and thereby doubly deny the field of permissible governmental action, but they cannot conflict. To be sure, each clause in its own way works to protect religious freedom. And when circumstances are such that the scope of the clauses overlap, they necessarily complement rather than conflict with each other. However, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s imagining these two negations on governmental power as frequently clashing is at the conceptual level simply not possible...|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} and tightly reasoned book brings {{a measure of}} coherency to this controversial and seemingly chaotic field of law. It begins by recounting the history of American religious liberty, from its Lockean origins to the First Amendment to the present day. Drawing upon that history, it identifies a set of embedded and evolving constitutional values: religious voluntarism, respect for religious identity, religious equality, and freedom of religious speech, as well as broader structural values such as preserving tradition, protecting government from religion, and protecting religion from government. The book returns to these values time and again as it explores and evaluates the Supreme Court’s contemporary First Amendment doctrine under the Free <b>Exercise</b> and <b>Establishment</b> Clauses, {{as well as its}} protection of religious speech under the Free Speech Clause. A separate chapter discusses other important sources of religious freedom, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). The book provides comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of all of the major facets of the Supreme Court’s decisionmaking, including the Court’s general doctrinal tests as well as its rulings and reasoning in particular areas, for example, concerning prayer and religious instruction in the public schools, religious symbolism in other settings, legislative prayer, financial aid to religious schools and organizations, and claims for religious exemptions under RFRA and RLUIPA. It provides selective coverage of lower court decisions as well, for instance, under the land use provisions of RLUIPA. It also includes references to leading academic works. In its concluding chapter, the book highlights ongoing developments in the American religious landscape and explains how they might affect the future of religious liberty in the United States. Offering clear exposition combined with {{creative and}} sophisticated analysis, this book will be of value not only to students but also to scholars, lawyers, and judges.
