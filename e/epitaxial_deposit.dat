40|$|Scanning Laser Epitaxy (SLE) {{is a new}} {{laser-based}} layer-by-layer generative {{manufacturing technology}} being developed in the Direct Digital Manufacturing Laboratory at Georgia Tech. SLE allows creation of geometrically complex three-dimensional components with as-desired microstructure through controlled melting and solidification of stationary metal-alloy powder placed on top of like-chemistry substrates. The proposed research seeks to garner knowledge about the fundamental physics of SLE through simulation-based studies and apply this knowledge for hot section turbine component repair and ultimately extend the process capability to enable one-step manufacture of complex gas turbine components. Prior methods of repair specifically for hot-section Ni-base superalloys have shown limited success, failed to consistently maintain epitaxy in the repaired part and suffered from several mechanical and metallurgical defects. The use of a fine focused laser beam, close thermal control and overlapping raster scan pattern allows SLE to perform significantly better {{on a range of}} so-called “non-weldable” Ni-base superalloys. The process capability is expanded further through closed-loop feedback control of melt pool temperature using an infra-red thermal camera. The process produces dense, crack-free and <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposit</b> for single-crystal (SX) (CMSX 4), equiaxed (René- 80, IN 100) and directionally solidified (DS) (René- 142) Ni-based superalloys. However, to enable consistent and repeatable production of defect-free parts and future commercial implementation of the technology several concerns related to process capabilities and fundamental physics need to be addressed. To explore the process capability, the fabricated components are characterized in terms of several geometrical, mechanical and metallurgical parameters. An active-contour based image analysis technique has been developed to obtain several microstructural responses from the optical metallography of sample cross-sections and the process goes through continuous improvement through optimization of the process parameters through subsequent design of experiments. The simulation-based study is aimed at developing a multiphysics model that captures the fundamental physics of the fabrication process and allows the generation of constitutive equations for microstructural transitions and properties. For this purpose, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) finite-volume solver is used to model the melting and solidification process. The development work also focuses on studying process response to different superalloy materials and implementing a multivariate statistical process control that allows efficient management and optimization of the design parameter space. In contrast to the prior work on single-bead laser scan, the model incorporates the raster scan pattern in SLE and the temperature dependent local property variations. The model is validated through thermal imaging data. The flow-thermal model is further tied to an empirical microstructural model through the active-contour based optical image analysis technique, which enables the identification of several microstructural transitions for laser beam describing a raster scan pattern. The CFD model can effectively be coupled with finite element solver to assess the stress and deformation and can be coupled with meso-scale models (Cellular Automata) to predict different microstructural evolutions. The research thus allows extending the SLE process to different superalloy materials, performs statistical monitoring of the process, and studies the fundamental physics of the process to enable formulation of constitutive relations for use in closed-loop feedback control; thus imparting ground breaking capability to SLE to fabricate superalloy components with as-desired microstructures.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substrate}} orientation {{on the quality}} of silicon epitaxial ayers was studied in terms of deposition rate and surface topography. The layer was deposited by the hydrogen reduction of silicon tetrachloride. Deposition rate was determined from the time of deposition and from the layer thickness ob-tained by angle lapping and staining. Deposition rate was lowest on accurately oriented substrates and increased as the degree of misorientation from the direction increased. The frequently observed surface pyramid de-fect was found to be a function of (a) deposition rate and (b) substrate orientation. These pyramidal defects were not observed for low deposition rates, and when the substrate was misoriented from the direction. These observations are consistent with the proposal that the deposition rate used in practice is determined by two fundamental rate processes, namely, (a) reaction rate and (b) growth rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report some new {{experimental}} and theoretical results about the analysis of in-plane lattice spacing oscillations during two-dimensional (2 D) homo and hetero epitaxial growth. The physical origin of these oscillations comes from the finite size of the strained islands. The 2 D islands may thus relax by their edges, leading to in-plane lattice spacing oscillations during the birth and spread of these islands. On the one hand, we formulate the problem of elastic relaxation of a coherent 2 D <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposits</b> by using the concept of point forces and demonstrate that the mean deformation in the islands exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. On the other hand, we calculate the intensity diffracted by such coherently deposited 2 D islands by using a mean model of a pile-up of weakly deformed layers. The amplitude of in-plane lattice spacing oscillations is found to depend linearly on the misfit and roughly linearly on the nucleation density. We show that the nucleation density may be approximated from the full-width at half maximum of the diffracted rods at half coverages. The predicted dependence of the in-plane lattice spacing oscillations amplitude with the nucleation density is thus experimentally verified on V/Fe(001), Mn/Fe(001), Ni/Fe(001), Co/Cu(001) and V/V(001).

One way to avoid kerf loss and to reach thicknesses of less than 50 μm is a lift-off approach using porous silicon and epitaxial thickening for silicon foil fabrication. The porous layer structure requires a reorganization step that was varied in this work to optimize the detachment properties and the crystal quality of the epitaxial Si film.

Especially for their integration into frequency-tunable rf-devices (i. e. for mobile communications) the linear and nonlinear dielectric properties of thin ferroelectric SrTiO_ 3 -films are of interest. Therefore, in this work the structural as well as the dielectric properties of thin SrTiO_ 3 -films are being examined. The lattice strain of the <b>epitaxial</b> <b>deposited</b> SrTiO_ 3 films is proven to strongly effect the dielectric properties. Correlations of the dielectric constant, the rf loss, the dielectric tunability and the structural properties are demonstrated. The results are explained in terms of a thermodynamic model that describes the influence of lattice strain on the polarization of the SrTiO_ 3 films. Experimental determination of the intermodulation distortion (IMD) proofs to be an ideal tool for the examination of the nonlinear dielectric properties of the films. IMDs are generated by applying two fundamental rf-signals of slightly different frequencies to systems with nonlinear properties. Two different origins of IMD-signals are being verified for our SrTiO_ 3 -films: the nonlinear behaviour of the dielectric constant and the onset of conductivity at extremely high fundamental rf-powers. The coaction of both mechanisms leads to a rather unusual dependence of the IMD signals on the power of the fundamental signals. Furthermore, the nonlinear dielectric constant generates IMD signals of higher orders i, i. e. i = 3, 5, 7, 9. (orig.)
