50|$|Dark meat {{contains}} 2.64 {{times more}} saturated fat than white meat, per gram of protein. One commentator wrote that dark meat contains more vitamins, while a New York Times columnist has stated the two meats are nearly identical in nutritional value, especially {{when compared with}} typical red meat. Dark meat is converted into Type II or fast-twitch muscle in the human body. For ground-based birds like chicken and turkeys, dark meats occur in the legs, which are used to support {{the weight of the}} animals while they move. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one ounce of boneless, skinless turkey breast contains about one gram of fat, compared with roughly two grams of fat for an ounce of boneless, skinless thigh. The numbers go up when the skin is kept in: a chicken thigh, with skin intact, has 13 grams of total fat and 3.5 <b>grams</b> of <b>saturated</b> fat per 3-ounce serving; this is about 20 percent of the recommended maximum daily intake. Birds which use their chest muscles for sustained flight (such as geese and ducks) have dark meat throughout their bodies.|$|R
50|$|According to the Massachusetts Medical Society Committee on Nutrition, fast {{foods are}} {{commonly}} {{high in fat}} content, and studies have found associations between fast food intake and increased body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. In particular many fast foods are high in saturated fats which are widely held to be a risk factor in heart disease. In 2010, heart disease was the number 1 ranking cause of death. A 2006 study fed monkeys a diet consisting of a similar level of trans fats as what a person who ate fast food regularly would consume. Both diets contained the same overall number of calories. It {{was found that the}} monkeys who consumed higher levels of trans fat developed more abdominal fat than those fed a diet rich in unsaturated fats. They also developed signs of insulin resistance, an early indicator of diabetes. After six years on the diet, the trans fat fed monkeys had gained 7.2% of their body weight, compared to just 1.8% in the unsaturated fat group. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of about 16 <b>grams</b> of <b>saturated</b> fats a day.|$|R
5000|$|The Cheesecake Factory {{has been}} criticized for {{featuring}} large servings of high calorie and high fat foods, and a corresponding lack of healthy menu options. For these reasons, the chain was dubbed the [...] "worst family restaurant in America" [...] for 2010 by Men's Health magazine. The average sandwich at the restaurant contains 1,400 calories. In 2013, the Center for Science in the Public Interest gave a better understanding toward some of the food found at The Cheesecake Factory, including the [...] "Crispy Chicken Costoletta" [...] that has more calories (2,610) than a 12-piece bucket of fried chicken from KFC and The Cheesecake Factory's [...] "Bistro Shrimp Pasta" [...] dish, which had more calories than any other entrée from a national chain restaurant at 3,120 calories, with 89 <b>grams</b> of <b>saturated</b> fat. The United States Department of Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion states in its dietary guidelines that a typical female adult should consume about 2,000 calories (males plus 500) and no more than 10% of saturated fat per day.

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} study the removal of zinc using {{bentonite}} clay from the Northeastern Brazil, as an adsorbent. A study of the clay subjected to thermal and chemical treatment was performed in order to evaluate the optimization of the adsorption capacity of this material. For {{the evaluation of the}} kinetic equilibrium of the process, experimental tests were carried out in a finite bath system. The maximum amount of metal adsorbed was 0. 151 mEq of metal per gram of calcined clay and 0. 257 mEq of metal per <b>gram</b> of sodium <b>saturated</b> clay. The kinetic models of pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion were fitted to experimental data, and the pseudo-second order model provided the best result. The Langmuir and Freundlich models were used for the adsorption equilibrium analysis, and the Langmuir model provided the best fit for sorption isotherms. The physicochemical characterization of clay involved X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, helium pyconometry and thermogravimetric analysis. The modified clay has potential use for removing Zn 2 + ions replacing more expensive adsorbents, since good adsorption properties will be also associated with great availability and low cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether dietary habits and {{physical}} activity patterns were independently associated with severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. Data collected from 320 adults participating in an ancillary study of The Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study were analyzed as a cross-sectional assessment at study baseline. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was used as a measure of the severity of sleep disordered breathing. Separate linear regression models were fitted using RDI as the independent variable and various preselected components of dietary intake and physical activity as the dependent variables. The results indicated that even after adjusting for BMI, age, and daytime sleepiness, subjects with very severe and extremely severe SDB (RDI ≥ 50) consumed a diet that was higher in cholesterol, protein, total fat, and total saturated fatty acids. These findings were most evident among women. For all participants, those with RDI ≥ 50 in comparison to those < 50, on average consumed 88. 16 more mg of cholesterol per day (95 % CI: 44. 45 to 131. 86, p < 0. 001). Among the women participants only, those with RDI ≥ 50 in comparison to those < 50, on average consumed 21. 96 more grams of protein (95 % CI: 2. 64 to 41. 29, p = 0. 026), 27. 75 more grams of total fat (95 % CI: 3. 38 to 52. 11, p = 0. 026), and 9. 24 more <b>grams</b> of <b>saturated</b> fatty acids (95 % CI: 0. 67 to 17. 80, p = 0. 035). Furthermore, those with an RDI ≥ 50 had a 224. 58 greater caloric expenditure than those with RDI < 50 from all activities including work and sleep (95 % CI: 40. 98 to 408. 18, p = 0. 017). Although significant results were seen in a reduction of physical activity from recreational activities, this finding was explained by the increase in BMI associated with higher levels of RDI...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{regeneration}} temperature on characteristics {{and extent of}} desorption of saturatedCuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 have been studied. Adsorbent CuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 (8 %-Cu) was prepared using the dry impregnation method with Cu(NO 3) 2. 3 H 2 O solution on a commercial γ-Al 2 O 3. SO 2 adsorption process of the adsorbent CuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 were conducted on temperature of 400 °C with a concentration of SO 2 in a model gas of 18500 ppmv and the initial weight of adsorbent of 1. 0 <b>gram.</b> Regeneration of <b>saturated</b> adsorbent were carried out under air flowat various temperatures of 500, 600 or 700 °C. Both of adsorption and regeneration experiments were carried out with a flowrateof model gas or air of 1. 4 – 1. 8 mL/sec for 60 minutes. Extent of desorption of saturated adsorbent CuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 were measured based on the different weight of the adsorbent between {{the beginning and the}} end of adsorption and regeneration process. Regeneration temperaturesof 500 and 600 °C did not significantly effect the averagepore diameter of adsorbent. But that of 700 °Caffectedthe specific surface area and averagepore diameter ofthe adsorbentsignificantly. The extent of desorption of the saturated adsorbentCuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 at the regeneration temperature of 600 °Cwas higher thanthose of 500 and 700 °C. Up to four adsorption-desorptioncycles, the extent of desorption were more less constant.
