40|$|Interstellar {{extinction}} {{includes both}} absorption and scattering of photons from interstellar {{gas and dust}} grains, {{and it has the}} effect of altering a source's spectrum and its total observed intensity. However, while multiple absorption models exist, there are no useful scattering models in standard X-ray spectrum fitting tools, such as XSPEC. Nonetheless, X-ray halos, created by scattering from dust grains, are detected around even moderately absorbed sources and the impact on an observed source spectrum can be significant, if modest, compared to direct absorption. By convolving the scattering cross section with dust models, we have created a spectral model as a function of energy, type of <b>dust,</b> and <b>extraction</b> region that can be used with models of direct absorption. This will ensure the extinction model is consistent and enable direct connections to be made between a source's X-ray spectral fits and its UV/optical extinction. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Mineral dust is a {{major source}} of micronutrients (e. g. Fe) in open oceans and HNLC zones. In the Southern Ocean in particular, the {{properties}} and impacts of current dust deposition are not well constrained. Here, several dust-bearing snow samples collected in the NE Antarctica coast are investigated in order to :(i) characterize the mineralogy, size, and morphology of dust by single particle analyses (automated-FEG-SEM-EDS and TEM-SAED), (ii) trace the origin and the relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic particles in dusts through elemental and multi-isotopic analyses (HR-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS) and (iii) quantify the Fe bioavailability in <b>dusts</b> (via <b>extractions).</b> Our first results show a fine size distribution (98 % of particles < 5 µm, n= 1550). A large fraction exhibits a Fe contribution, either from mineralogy or coating. While the mineralogy suggest a substantial contribution of proximal rocks, a high Pb enrichment factor (x 7 relative to upper continental crust - UCC) indicates an anthropogenic contribution to the dust deposition. Overall, this study will improve our understanding of dust reaching the coast of NE-Antarctica, which may represent a proxy for the dust material supplied to the Southern Ocean, by far the largest HNLC. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the mining}} {{industry}} has been concerned {{about the presence of}} soluble As(III)/As(V) in feed solution, which may affect the chemolithotrophic microorganisms that inhabit the heaps, thereby affecting the overall Cu bioleaching process. Soluble As may be present because it is a “chalcophile element” with a low affinity for oxygen, and preferentially bonding to sulfur to form sulfides (Oremland and Stolz 2003). As-containing MS (e.g., arsenopyrite FeAsS, or enargite Cu 3 AsS 4) are common in Cu-sulfide ore deposits. Thus, As-bearing phases are generated, and are present in solid and liquid waste from diverse mining processes, including roasting of the powdered enriched ore (producing fine particle waste), conversion of smelting products (<b>dusts),</b> the solvent <b>extraction</b> process (solutions), Cu recovery by refining (electrolytes), precious metals refinery (purges) and heap leaching [acid mine drainage (AMD)]. The concentration of arsenic in AMD, similar to that of mine heaps, may be from 2 to 20  g/L (Santini et al. 2000; Bednar et al. 2002; Delavat et al. 2012 a, b).|$|R
50|$|SMA {{is mixed}} {{and placed in}} the same plant as that used with {{conventional}} hot mix. In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, {{immediately}} after the launch of Craven A, Carreras launched yet more brands such as Wall Arms, Piccadilly and Turf. By 1927 the business had outgrown the Arcadia premises in City Road, the war had increased demand for cigarettes and, despite taking on additional London premises at Aldgate, Carreras {{had to find a}} new factory. In 1928, the famous Arcadia Works was opened in Mornington Crescent NW1, formerly a favourite residence of artists and writers. This building, which has become a major London landmark, was as revolutionary in its concept as it was unusual in its design. It was the first factory in Britain to make use of pre-stressed concrete technology, the first to contain air conditioning and a <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> plant and the company was the first to provide full welfare services for its employees. Such was the fame of the Arcadia Works that it was often visited by royalty, including the Duke of Windsor when he was the Prince of Wales, King George VI when he was the Duke of York, and the late Duke of Kent. Many other important visitors from every part of the globe were entertained at Mornington Crescent. Dominating the entrance to the building were two large bronze cats. [...] Cast at the Haskins Foundry in London, these versions of the Egyptian god Bastet were each eight feet six inches tall and stood guard over Arcadia Works until 1959 when Carreras merged with Rothmans of Pall Mall and moved to a new factory in Basildon, Essex. The cats were separated, with one making the short journey to Essex, but one went to bask in the sun outside the Carreras factory at Spanishtown, Jamaica.|$|E
5000|$|De Hoop is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as a [...] "stellingmolen" [...] It is a three-storey smock mill on a three-storey base. The stage is at third-floor level, 7.00 m above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch with a continuous chain. The cap rotates on 24 wooden blocks. The sails on the outer sailstock are Common sails, with leading edges streamlined on the Fok system. The sails on the inner sailstock are Ten Have sails, with leading edges fitted with aerofoils on the Van Bussel system. Both have a span of 24.55 m. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by IJzergieterij Hardinxveld-Giessendam as number 47. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 65 cogs. This drives the wallower (32 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 87 cogs, drives the two lantern pinion stone nuts, which have 27 and 28 staves. These drive the 1.40 m and 1.50 m diameter millstones. A third pair of stones is driven by an electric motor so production could continue on days when there was not enough wind.Several modern developments were added during the 1992 rebuild. A chain elevator lifted grain from the ground floor to the grain silos on the third floor (first floor in the smock) from where it could be fed by gravity to one of the pairs of millstones. The grain flow to the silos and from silo to millstone was computer controlled by pneumatically operated valves. Also a central <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> system was added. Flour was collected on the first floor in a large silo and mixer from where it could be bagged on the ground floor. Unfortunately following years of standstill and disuse these systems are no longer functional. The ground floor also houses a small shop selling flour and bread making products.|$|E
40|$|A {{huge amount}} of blue dust is {{produced}} during mining operations of iron ore and mostly dumped at mines site. Till date no measure action is being taken for utilization of blue <b>dust</b> for <b>extraction</b> of metallic iron. Generally metallic iron is produced through BFO and DRI processes where particle/ore size and reductant {{is the most important}} factor considered for BF charge. The present piece of research work is aimed at use of blue dust for production of metallic iron. A newly emerging technology i. e. plasma smelting process is adopted for reduction of blue dust. Blue dust of average particle size about 100 - 150 micron is taken and carbon (pet coke) of 5, 10, 12, 15 and 20 percent is thoroughly mixed, used as feed material. It is charged to a 35 KW dc arc plasma furnace and smelted for different time lengths i. e. 10, 17 and 20 min using argon and nitrogen, separately, as plasma forming gas. The degree of metallization, amount of recovery for all samples is measured. Maximum of 86 % recovery and 98 % metallization is achieved. It is observed that use of nitrogen as plasma forming gas increases the rate of recovery than that of argon plasma, due to high energy flux of nitrogen gas which increases the enthalpy due to its diatomicity. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows the presence of ferrite and cementite phases in the smelted product. Variation of microstructure is observed with the samples. The hardness measurement of different phases on the sample ensured the presence of ferrite, pearlite and cementite phases depending on smelting condition...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} limiting nutrients for the growth of oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial ecosystems, which in turn contributes to CO 2 sequestration. The solid-phase speciation of P will influence its solubility and hence its availability to such ecosystems. This study reports on the results of X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe chemical analysis and X-ray mapping, chemical extractions and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis carried out to determine the solid-phase speciation of P in dusts and their source sediments from the Saharan Bodélé Depression, the world’s largest single source of <b>dust.</b> Chemical <b>extraction</b> data suggest that the Bodélé dusts contain 28 to 60 % (mean 49 %) P sorbed to, or co-precipitated with Fe (hydr) oxides, < 10 % organic P, 21 - 50 % (mean 32 %) detrital apatite P, and 10 - 22 % (mean 15 %) authigenic-biogenic apatite P. This is confirmed by the other analyses, which also suggest that the authigenic-biogenic apatite P is likely fish bone and scale, and that this might form a larger proportion of the apatite pool (33 +/− 22 %) than given by the extraction data. This is the first-ever report of fish material in aeolian dust, and it is significant because P derived from fish bone and scale is relatively soluble and is often used as a soil fertilizer. Therefore, the fish-P will likely be the most readily form of Bodélé P consumed during soil weathering and atmospheric processing, but given time and acid dissolution, the detrital apatite, Fe-P and organic-P will also be made available. The Bodélé dust input of P to global ecosystems will only have a limited life, however, because its major source materials, diatomite in the Bodélé Depression, undergo persistent deflation and have a finite thickness...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. To {{assess the}} effect of various vaccine strains on {{replication}} and shedding of virulent Marek’s disease virus from experimentally infected chickens, quantitative PCR (q-PCR) methods were developed to accurately quantify viral DNA in infected chickens and in {{the environment in which}} they were housed. Four groups of 10 chickens, kept in poultry isolators, were vaccinated at 1 day old with one of four vaccines covering each of the three vaccine serotypes, then challenged with very virulent MDV strain Md 5 at 8 days of age. At regular time-points, feather tips were collected from each chicken and poultry dust was collected from the air-extract prefilter of each isolator. DNA was extracted from feather and dust samples and subjected to real-time q-PCR, targeting the US 2 gene of MDV- 1, in order to measure Md 5 level per 10 4 feather tip cells or per microgram of dust. Accuracy of DNA <b>extraction</b> from <b>dust</b> and real-time q-PCR were validated by comparing either q-PCR cycle threshold values or the calculated MDV genome level; for use in q-PCR, DNA was extracted from serial dilutions of MDV-infected dust diluted with noninfected dust, or DNA from MDV-infected dust was diluted with DNA from noninfected dust. The results confirmed the accuracy and sensitivity of <b>dust</b> DNA <b>extraction</b> and subsequent q-PCR and showed that differences in virus levels between dust samples truly reflect differences in shedding. Vaccination delayed both replication of Md 5 in feather tips and shedding of Md 5. First detection of Md 5 in feather tips always preceded or coincided with first detection in dust in each group. pCVI 988 and HVT+SB- 1 were the most efficient vaccines in reducing both replication and shedding of Md 5. There was close correlation between mean virus level i...|$|R

40|$|Elevated {{platinum}} (Pt) concentrations {{are found}} in road dust {{as a result of}} emissions from catalytic converters in vehicles. This study investigates the occurrence of Pt in road dust collected in Ghent (Belgium) and Gothenburg (Sweden). Total Pt contents, determined by tandem ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS), were in the range of 5 to 79 ng g − 1, comparable to the Pt content in road dust of other medium-sized cities.

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of the processes that metals undergo during dry weather periods whilst deposited on urban surfaces and their environmental significance is essential to predict the potential influence of metals on stormwater quality and thereby to develop appropriate stormwater pollution mitigation measures. However, very limited research has been undertaken in this area. Accordingly, this study investigated the geochemical phase and particle size relationships of seven metals which are commonly associated with urban road <b>dust,</b> using sequential <b>extraction</b> {{in order to assess}} their mobility characteristics. Metals in the sequentially extracted fractions of exchangeable, reducible, oxidisable and residual were found to follow a similar trend for different land uses even though they had variable accumulation loads. The high affinity of Cd and Zn for exchangeable reactions in both, bulk and size-fractionated solid samples confirmed their high mobility, while the significant enrichment of Ni and Cr in the stable residual fraction indicated a low risk of mobility. The study results also confirmed the availability of Cu, Pb and Mn in both, stable and mobile fractions. The fine fraction of solids (< 150 µm) and antecedent dry days can be highlighted as important parameters when determining the fate of metals associated with urban road dust. The outcomes from this study are expected to {{contribute to the development of}} effective stormwater pollution mitigation strategies by taking into consideration the metal-particulate relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this article assessed geochemical factors relating to dust produced during primary lead smelting. Bulk dust samples and size-selective airborne dust samples were collected from four areas of a primary lead smelter and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and sequential chemical extraction. X-ray diffraction showed that the smelter dusts were composed primarily of sulfides, oxides, sulfates, and silicates of metal ores, with galena being the primary <b>dust</b> component. Sequential <b>extraction</b> revealed the solubility of lead compounds at less than 7 % in the exchangeable and mildly acidic steps for the bulk dusts collected from four smelter areas. The later steps of the extraction procedure were more effective in dissolving the lead compounds associated with the bulk dust samples, with 43 %, 26 %, and 8 % of the total lead, in the ore storage, sinter, and blast/dross smelter areas, respectively, being extracted in the residual step. Sequential extraction of coarse airborne dust samples from the ore storage and sinter plant showed that 1. 2 % and 4. 1 % of the total lead, respectively, was exchangeable. The finer particle size fractions from these areas of the smelter showed higher percentages of exchangeable lead. Of the course airborne dust from the blast/dross furnace processes, 65 % of the total lead was exchangeable. However, the largest percentage of lead from these areas was associated with the finer particle-size fractions. If lead bioavailability is related to its solubility as determined through sequential extraction, the health hazards associated with lead exposure may be appreciably enhanced in the blast and dross furnace processes...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{weathering}} of silicate rocks generates soils {{that contain}} mineral nutrients, sustain ecosystems, modify water chemistry in the hydrosphere, and regulate the global carbon cycle. Understanding the timescales of soil formation {{and sources of}} soil mineral nutrients has great implications for securing the future of agriculture and food production. However, few tools are currently available to directly quantify the rates of chemical weathering and timescales of soil formation. Uranium-series isotopes fractionate during chemical weathering and the activity ratios of (234 U/ 238 U), (230 Th/ 238 U), (238 U/ 232 Th) and (230 Th/ 232 Th) have great potential to constrain the rates and timescales of chemical weathering and soil formation in soil profiles. In addition, U-series techniques {{have been used in}} conjunction with strontium (Sr) isotopes to trace source materials in open systems, provided that the end-member reservoirs have distinct isotope signatures. By combining U-series and Sr isotope analysis in soil profiles, it is possible to quantify rates of chemical weathering and soil formation as well as to identify trace sources of mineral nutrients. ^ The objectives of this study are 1) to identify key processes such as chemical weathering vs. atmospheric deposition that affect soil formation and development and 2) to quantify chemical weathering rates in volcanic soil profiles under a tropical climate. The study site is situated in Basse-Terre Island of French Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. Thick soil/regolith profiles with rock clasts are developed due to rapid and intensive weathering of andesitic parent materials. Shallow soils are highly depleted with respect to mineral nutrients and atmospheric contributions to soil mineral nutrients {{have been shown to be}} important for the volcanic island. In this study, I focused on three deep soil cores with depths ranging from 8 to 12 m from the Bras-David, Moustique Petit-Bourg, and Deshaies watersheds that are distributed across the large precipitation gradient of the island, and water samples from the rivers adjacent to these soil sites. Soil and water samples were collected from field trips to Basse-Terre in 2014 and from archived soil samples collected in July 2007. Analyses for major element concentrations, U-series, and Sr isotopic ratios in bulk soils, sequential extraction fractions, and river water were performed at The University of Texas at El Paso. ^ Results indicate that chemical weathering reactions are integral to the conversion of andesitic bedrock into thick accumulations of depleted soils since mobile elements such as calcium, magnesium, and strontium have undergone intensive chemical weathering at the deep soil profiles when compared to samples representing the parent bedrock collected from outcrops. Surface processes, such as dust addition, impact soil development, as evidenced by increase of mobile elements near the surface. This observation is further confirmed by the isotopic analysis, where U-series and Sr ratios increase at the surface with signatures similar to the Saharan <b>dust</b> end-member. Sequential <b>extraction</b> procedures reveal the release of mobile elements near the surface during the first leaching phase, with U and Sr isotope signatures similar to marine aerosols. Constraining soil profile-scale weathering rates of andesite were achieved by solving a set of differential equations on U-series mass balances in the profile, thus yielding a duration of chemical weathering range from 300 to 400 Kyr, and an average weathering rate of 30 m/Ma in the weathering profile. ^ Because of ongoing investigations of chemical weathering rates across a range of scales of observation on Basse-Terre Island, the results from the three soil profiles located in the Deshaies, Moustique Petit-Bourg and Bras David watersheds can be directly compared with local clast and watershed scale observations. The sensitivity of calculated chemical weathering rates varies according to the scale of observation. The collected soil profiles did not reach the unweathered bedrock, therefore the deep regolith samples are composed of highly weathered clay minerals. Weathering clasts exhibit a slower weathering rate (0. 3 m/Ma) due to its small scale of surface area, while high solute fluxes transported by rivers in the Bras David watershed yield much faster chemical weathering rates (300 m/Ma), therefore, the transformation of bedrock to regolith occurs at much greater depth. ...|$|R

It is therefore recommended that a <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> unit be used when cutting all types of bandage...|$|E

Carbonaceous particles are produced in an argon plasma using acetylene. As {{soon as the}} particle density becomes sufficient, dust density waves (DDWs) are spontaneously excited within the cathode sheath. Recently, it was proven that DDWs can significantly enhance the agglomeration rate between particles by transferring them a significant kinetic energy. Thus, it helps them to overcome Coulomb repulsion. The influence of this mechanism is studied from acetylene injection {{to the formation of}} very large agglomerates forming an organized structure after a few dozens of seconds. For this purpose, three diagnostic tools are used: extinction measurements to probe nanometer-sized particles, fast imaging for large agglomerates and a <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> technique developed for ex-situ analysis.
