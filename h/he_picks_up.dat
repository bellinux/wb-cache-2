5|$|President Bartlet sneaks out to go {{shopping}} at a rare book store and refuses to take photographers along, much to Mandy's chagrin. Donna has at this point been pestering Josh about her Christmas gift all day. While he doesn't follow the list submitted, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a book for her at the shop and writes a message in it that leaves her tearful but happy.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> on the repetitive {{nature of his}} own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> the fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, {{but after a few}} months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> {{his fifth}} victory on the Sunshine Tour at the Telkom PGA Championship. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> two more wins in 2014, one in 2015 {{and another in}} 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Paul: [...] "... Dick came round. He {{was a bit}} of a musician, played jazz piano, so he {{was even}} more interesting. ... He got hold of Alun Owen, a Welsh playwright who'd written Last Tram to Lime Street. ... <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> little quotes like 'He's very clean, isn't he?' <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the jokes and sarcasm, the Beatle humour, John's wit and each one of us, Ringo's laconic humour. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> our characters, which was good." ...|$|R

5|$|Outside, Madonna rummages debris, {{tries to}} make a phone-call from a payphone, gets frustrated, and starts smashing objects {{in front of her}} with the rod. Her actions catches the {{attention}} of a man, played by Howard. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> his sniper rifle to shoot at the object of disturbance, but seeing Madonna through the lens, runs after her. They meet each other at a destroyed building where both of them notice each other and circle around with weapons in their hand. They come close and instead of attacking they throw away the weapons, embrace each other and engage in a dance-routine. After they complete their dance, and the song ends, the couple notice a little boy watching them from the destroyed building. The video ends with the couple leaving the city with the little boy hand-in-hand together with a large dog, and a panorama of the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproduction}} of octopuses {{has been studied}} {{in only a few}} species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a {{thin strip}} of {{whalebone}} {{and showed it}} to them. The ends were sharp as needle-points. The strip he coiled carefully, till it disappeared in his hand. Then, suddenly releasing it, it sprang straight again. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a piece of blubber.|$|R
50|$|Yip {{has played}} on PGA Tour Canada since 2007, {{when it was}} known as the Canadian Tour. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his first {{professional}} win in a non-tour event at the Alberta Open in May 2009. In August <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his first Canadian Tour victory at the Jane Rogers Championship.|$|R

25|$|One day, Georges {{sits next}} to Anne's bedside and tells her a story of his childhood, which calms her. As he reaches the story's conclusion, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a pillow and smothers her.|$|E
25|$|Sim shows all of Shade's new {{recruits}} round the Sub, {{and seems to}} have some authority over the other children. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> on Gold-Eye's lack of sexual knowledge, and points him towards the relevant lessons.|$|E
25|$|The game {{also carries}} RPG {{elements}} such as leveling up by winning enough experience when defeating enemies. Enemies' attacks can also affect the player's commands with items <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> across the stages and activate them while opening the menu.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> one wicket in the match, that of James Byrne.|$|R

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> {{narratives}} left {{hanging from}} previous albums, magnifies recurring themes and takes signature production techniques to extremes. The album's structure – a seamless {{ebb and flow}} of interlinked songs – is dizzyingly grandiose, underpinned by a complementary sense of theatre and elegance. Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more of the}} contradictions and complexities at the core of his work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams {{are married}} {{and the parents}} of twin girls. They live at Ashgrove Cottage on his half-pay, not enough to support fellow navy men in the household. Sophia's mother lost her money, {{including}} Sophia's portion, and now lives with them. They have Cecelia, Sophia's young niece in their household as well. As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey {{is ready to go}} to sea again. Stephen Maturin comes to call, and soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey time to bring the crew of the Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop strategies.|$|E
25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He then looks at a withering daisy flower that <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up,</b> as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E
2500|$|Philander {{continued}} his sensational {{form in the}} series in New Zealand which began in March 2012. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> five wickets in the first test at Dunedin, which ended a draw. [...] He followed this up with a match-winning performance in the second test at Hamilton where <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> 4–70 and 6–44 for the second 10-wicket haul of his career.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> some dice from a checker-board {{and began}} throwing, right hand against left.|$|R
500|$|He {{observes that}} [...] "Every naturalist {{traveller}} {{appears to have}} some instance to relate of how he was taken in by a protectively-coloured insect. These stories are told with a curiously exaggerated delight at the deception...", giving as example how Professor Drummond in his book Tropical Africa thought a mantid was a wisp of hay. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> on the casually mentioned fact that Drummond's African companion was not deceived, writing {{that we should not}} judge camouflage [...] "from the human standpoint".|$|E
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he bends {{down to pick up}} the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> the broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E
500|$|After {{bringing}} Jordan {{back to her}} mother, Catherine (Megan Gallagher), Black {{is driving}} home when he notices several youths egging a house—the house he once shared with Catherine and Jordan, and in which his friend Bob Bletcher was killed. He goes inside, and overhears several teenagers gathered in the basement trying to scare each other {{with the story of}} Bletcher's murder. Black interrupts, scaring off the youths—and is again reminded of his past, recalling his reaction when Crocell was found to have committed suicide. As Black leaves the house, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> an egg carton discarded by the fleeing teenagers and throws the remaining eggs at the walls.|$|E

500|$|While in 1334BC Egypt with Queen Nefertiti, {{after an}} unseen adventure, the Doctor {{receives}} {{a call from}} the [...] "Indian Space Agency" [...] in 2367AD about a vast spaceship which will crash into Earth in six hours. [...] The ISA plans to destroy it with missiles unless the Doctor stops it first. Taking Nefertiti with him, <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> Edwardian explorer John Riddell from the African plains in 1902AD. He then materialises the TARDIS around his companions Amy and Rory ten months after he last saw them in [...] "Asylum of the Daleks", inadvertently taking Rory's father Brian on the TARDIS as well. They materialise in the spaceship and find that it contains dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One {{encounters}} {{three of}} his past incarnations: one practical, one good, and one paranoid. The Nameless One learns that the [...] "good" [...] incarnation is the original, who was made immortal by Ravel. The Nameless One had committed immeasurably terrible deeds in his lifetime, and when he realized there would be retribution on his soul when he died, he sought to postpone death {{as long as possible}} in order to atone. After meeting his past incarnations, The Nameless One confronts his mortality, which is embodied as a powerful being called The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One reveals that since being separated from The Nameless One, he has enjoyed his freedom and has been attempting to erase clues that might lead The Nameless One to discover the truth. Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One either slays his mortality or convinces it to rejoin with him; either option finally ends his immortality and allows him to die. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of the eternal Blood War between demons and devils; <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> a mace and walks toward the conflict.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the music video, Fernández turns on the car radio where a radio personality woman named Veronica is on air and he immediately gets flashbacks of her. Once he arrives at his house, he turns on the radio where Veronica plays [...] "No Sé Olvidar" [...] on the radio station. Fernández glances at the photos of him and Veronica and burns them at the fireplace. He steps outside but still cannot forget the time he spent with her and imagines Veronica next to him. He exercises as another attempt to forget but to no avail. Fernández takes a shower and hallucinates Veronica being next to him and holding him. Fernández begins to lose his mind and breaks the house furniture. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> another photo of him and Veronica, lits it on fire, and proceeds to set the house on fire. At the end of the song, Veronica asks Fernández for forgiveness on the radio. [...] "The video ends with a quote in Spanish, translating to [...] "Not even fire can consume the soul...". It received a nomination for Video of the Year at the 10th Annual Lo Nuesro Awards in 1998, but lost to [...] "Ella y Él" [...] by Ricardo Arjona.|$|E
