Most analysed hydrological gauging stations proved statistically significant upward trend, using Mann–Kendall statistical test. We noted that causes for statistically insignificant results on some stations, are deficiencies and irregularities in sets of temperature data and anthropogenic impacts on watercourses. Water temperature in rivers is heavily influenced by weather conditions, in particular air temperature. Water temperature data of selected water gauging stations were compared with air temperature data of space comparable meteorological station. We examined the Pearson correlation coefficient between water and air temperature. Correlation is sufficient, despite the problems with different quality {{of the air and}} water temperature data. The results of seasonal analysis of stream water temperature trends, showed an alarming rise of water temperature in the summer months. The temperature of the water courses vary, not only temporally but also geographically. We examined how the average water temperature is changing along the stream of rivers Sava and Savinja. We also examined the connection of air and water temperatures with the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> North Atlantic and Mediterranean oscillations. The results showed poor matching.

We test this hypothesis by examining causal links between time series of solar irradiance based on both amplitude and length of the 11 -year solar sunspot cycle and <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> Arctic <b>Oscillation</b> AO and ENSO activity. We use a wavelet lag coherence method based on wavelet filtering to examine the significance and magnitude of the phase coherence of the pairs of series in lag-period space. Hence we study the non-linear phase dynamics of weakly interacting oscillating systems. The method clearly shows no link between AO or SOI with solar irradiance at all scales from biannual to decadal. We conclude that the 11 -year cycle sometimes seen in climate proxy records {{is unlikely to be}} driven by solar forcing. ...|$|R

However, {{little has been}} done to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of air temperature in the Tarim Basin, northwest China. In this study, we collected daily air temperature from 19 meteorological stations for the period of 1960 - 2012, and analyzed annual mean temperature (AMT), the annual minimum (T min) and maximum temperature (Tmax), and mean temperatures of all twelve months and four seasons and their anomalies. Trend analyses, standard deviation of the detrended anomaly (SDDA) and correlations were carried out to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of various mean air temperatures. Our data showed that increasing trend was much greater in the T min (0. 55 °C/ 10 a) than in the AMT (0. 25 °C/ 10 a) and Tmax (0. 12 °C/ 10 a), and the fluctuation followed the same order. There were large spatial variations in the increasing trends of both AMT (from - 0. 09 to 0. 43 °C/ 10 a) and T min (from 0. 15 to 1. 12 °C/ 10 a). Correlation analyses indicated that AMT had a significantly linear relationship with T min and the mean temperatures of four seasons. There were also pronounced changes in the monthly air temperature from November to March at decadal time scale. The seasonality (i. e., summer and winter difference) of air temperature was stronger during the period of 1960 - 1979 than over the recent three decades. Our preliminary analyses indicated that local environmental conditions (such as elevation) might be partly responsible for the spatial variability, and large scale climate phenomena might have influences on the temporal variability of air temperature in the Tarim Basin. In particular, there was a significant correlation between <b>index</b> <b>of</b> El Niño-Southern <b>Oscillation</b> (ENSO) and air temperature of May (P = 0. 004), and between the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> Pacific Decadal <b>Oscillation</b> (PDO) and air temperature of July (P = 0. 026) over the interannual to decadal time scales...|$|R

The reality of non-stationary rainfall extremes should be properly considered {{in the design of}} water {{infrastructure and}} flood mitigation projects, because the extreme value distribution models with constant parameters may no longer be valid under non-stationary climate conditions. In this study, first extreme rainfall frequency analysis in Victoria (Australia) was conducted through generalized extreme value (GEV) models under non-stationary and stationary climate conditions, and superiority of non-stationary GEV models over stationary models was investigated. High quality extreme rainfall data (i. e. annual maximums) from 23 stations in Victoria for storm durations ranging from 10 min to 48 h were used for frequency analysis. In developing the non-stationary extreme rainfall models, both the time dependency and the dependency to <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> climate <b>oscillations</b> affecting Australian rainfall variability were investigated.

In contrast to the conventional approach, which engages models that are physically-based but very data-demanding and computation-intense, the proposed method is a data-driven randomized search algorithm capable of inducing a model from moderate amount of training data at reasonable computational cost. GP maintains a population of models and recombines them iteratively to improve their performance meant as an ability to explain the training data.
