5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who argue most for {{war against the}} Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|The F571 {{extension}} is {{orthogonal to}} the presence of the boolean datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce boolean or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 extension was actually present in SQL92, well before the boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 extension is implemented by few systems however; PostgreSQL <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> implementing it.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury has a non-selective {{education}} system, {{assessed by}} the SATs exam. There are seven primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951. Parrs Wood and The Barlow were two of only six schools in Manchester to achieve the Manchester Inclusion Standard in 2007, awarded by Manchester Council to those schools doing innovative work {{to ensure that all}} their pupils are able to participate fully in the school's activities.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that there were at least two inns during the 18th century, although their precise locations and names are unknown. In 1827, Parson and White's Directory listed the Brown Jug, adjoining Carr Hill Pottery at Carr Hill Lane and it is likely that this venue <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> earlier inns. The second is likely the Old Fellows Inn, located near the Brown Jug at Carr Hill Lane, listed in 1844, but later listed as 'The Free Gardeners Arms". By 1856, both the Brown Jug and the Free Gardeners Arms were well established and thriving and continued to prosper well into the 20th century, under the slightly different names of The Old Brown Jug and The Gardeners Arms.|$|E

25|$|However, {{because of}} the holiday rules, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, so if TM2 <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> days, Rosh Hashanah in year 2 is {{postponed}} by adding one day to year 1 (the second deḥiyyah). To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2. It is to allow for these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.|$|E

An Austrian division defeated his independent command near Geneva in 1814. During the Hundred Days he was tasked with stopping Napoleon's march near Grenoble, but his troops went over to the ex-emperor. For this, he was later tried by the Bourbons but acquitted. His surname <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between the Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana is their rights to land. In Guyana, Amerindian villages are state elected administrative units {{but there is nothing}} relating to the reservation system and villages are in remote areas. Although the situation of Guyanese Wapishana is better than most part of the Brazilian population of Wapishana, it is still far from perfect. Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.|$|E
25|$|His {{father is}} just a name, which occurs in various forms, e.g., Entifidich in the Poppleton manuscript, Enfidaig, Amfredech, Anfudeg, and as Amfodech in the French king-list {{embedded}} in the Scalacronica. The list in National Library of Scotland MS, Advocates' 34.7.3, seems to say that Taran was the brother of King Nechtan m. Der-Ilei, which could mean that Taran's mother was the Pictish princess Der-Ilei. However, the latter list is problematic and places the reign of King Bridei m. Der-Ilei, Nechtan's brother, after Nechtan; on the other hand, the list <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that is aware that Bridei {{was the son of}} Dargart, indicating access to material not available to some of the other lists.|$|E
