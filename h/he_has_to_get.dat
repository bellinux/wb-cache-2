5|$|Leslie meets Ann at the pit {{with the}} rented excavator, which starts filling {{it in with}} dirt. However, they failed to realize Andy was under some tarps in the pit, and he is injured when mounds of dirt fall on him. He is taken to the hospital, where Ann is {{assigned}} as his nurse. An angry Ron (Nick Offerman) tells Leslie the town is now open to a large potential lawsuit from Andy, and he sends her to visit him along with their city attorney Scott (H. Jon Benjamin).

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

50|$|The size of Bromley's {{fine for}} {{his support of}} Essex was never {{disclosed}} {{but it must have}} been substantial as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> permission <b>to</b> sell land to pay it. He mortgaged his Montgomeryshire property to his second cousin, Francis Newport for £2,800. His fourth wife Anne Beswick, whom he married in 1604 was a wealthy widow and the lands he obtained through his court connections brought him £5000 later that year. Yet in 1606 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the king <b>to</b> write to Newport asking for an extension on his mortgage.|$|R

500|$|Steinberg {{next came}} up with the idea of showing Oguri moving through two busy Los Angeles intersections. The result is the 11-minute dance film [...] "Xing", which was {{screened}} in 2003 at the Getty Center during Dance Camera West. [...] "Nothing was choreographed beforehand. Oguri does not choreograph, he improvises. But the shots are very specific and the direction is very specific. He knows that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from point A to point B, but I do not mind how." [...] Steinberg made her first feature-length documentary, Height of Sky, about Oguri, and it was shown on the Sundance Channel in 2008.|$|E

[...] Daniel Stern guest starred as the voice of the adult Bart, just like he did for the adult voice of the character Kevin in the television show The Wonder Years (he had also featured with Yeardley Smith in the movie City Slickers around the time this episode was produced).|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Button again {{competed with}} Honda {{alongside}} Barrichello. He {{was unable to}} take part in winter testing, prior to the season because of two hairline fractures to his ribs, sustained in a karting incident in late 2006. Former British world champion Damon Hill aired doubts over Button's hopes to be a championship contender at Honda over the coming season, saying, [...] "if he is serious... <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> himself in a car that is a championship contender." [...] Alan Henry writing in The Guardian 2007 F1 season guide, predicted: [...] "Button will win a couple more races but is not a title contender." [...] He was proved to be wrong, as the Honda RA107 proved to be aerodynamically poor.|$|E
2500|$|Upset {{at getting}} the raw {{end of the}} deal, the Robot Devil decides <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his own hands back. He begs Fry, but Fry refuses {{reminding}} him they made a deal. The Robot Devil tries {{to make a deal}} with Bender for his hands. When Bender refuses the Robot Devil then makes another deal, in which he trades Bender a stadium air horn for his [...] "crotch-plate" [...] so that he can annoy people. When Bender uses the air horn on Leela, he causes her to go deaf. Leela refuses to tell Fry that she is deaf because she is afraid that Fry will stop writing the opera, so she attends the premiere pretending she can still hear the performance. During the intermission, the Robot Devil offers Leela robotic ears in exchange for one of her hands at a time of his choosing. Desperate to hear the opera, Leela accepts the offer.|$|E

2500|$|Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox {{are forced}} {{to pack up and}} leave their Southern {{settings}} after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. The trio moves to Harlem, [...] "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.|$|E
