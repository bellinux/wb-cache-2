Substitution of composite material over the conventional steel material for <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has increasing the advantages of design due to its high specific stiffness and strength. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{the main component of}} drive system of an automobile. Use of conventional steel for manufacturing of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has many disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength. Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency. Two piece <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> increases the weight of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> which is not desirable in today’s market. Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.

50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the <b>driven</b> <b>shaft</b> (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the <b>driven</b> <b>shaft.</b> Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|E
