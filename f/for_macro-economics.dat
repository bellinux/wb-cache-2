The core fiscal issues – taxation, expenditures, the fiscal deficit – are obviously important <b>for</b> <b>macro–economics.</b> In addition, governments have often chosen to use the Budget speech as a mechanism for announcing important new policy initiatives, and for outlining some plans for economic policy in the coming months. Casual empiricism reveals that stock market activity tends to be greatly influenced by the Budget. As of today, {{the highest number of}} trades ever recorded on NSE was 1. 4 million trades, on 28 February 2001, a Budget day. The stock market response to a Budget is often viewed as an important summary statistic of the ‘quality ’ of a Budget in terms of improving macro–economic prospects. In this paper, we seek to explore the interplay between the Budget and the stock market, in the following areas – Informational efficiency First, we seek to examine {{the extent to which the}} stock market response to the Union Budget is consistent with the behaviour that we might expect in an efficient market, i. e. in a world with speculation by rational economic agents.

Firstly, unemployment is asymmetric over the business cycle, i. e. it rises harply in recessions and it falls slowly in expansions. Secondly, its seasonal fluctuations are not constant {{across the two}} business cycle stages {{in the sense that}} there is less seasonality in recession periods. Thirdly, the effect of shocks to the unemployment ra e in expansions seem transitory, while this effect is permanent in recessions. Some implications of these stylized facts <b>for</b> empirical <b>macro-economics</b> and seasonal djustment are discussed. JEL Classification System-Numbers: C 22, E 24...|$|R
