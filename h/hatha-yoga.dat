The culture of the body (kāya-sādhana) through processes of <b>Haṭha-yoga</b> was of paramount importance in the Nāth sect and found in all sahaja schools. Whether conceived of as 'supreme bliss' (Mahā-sukha), as by the Buddhist Sahajiyās, or as 'supreme love' (as with the Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyās), strength of the body was deemed necessary to stand such a supreme realisation.|$|E

5000|$|When {{he began}} to {{introduce}} yoga {{in the treatment of}} Baumgartner's old and rheumatic patients, Khane had to adapt his teaching to the limited abilities of this new audience. For pedagogic reasons, he decided to introduce into his <b>hatha-yoga</b> lessons some Chinese exercises based on the inner style (Nei Shia) of the kung-fu method attributed to the Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma. He used in addition some postures depicted in the temples of ancient Egypt, which he calls [...] "Egyptian yoga".|$|E
5000|$|I quickly {{realized}} that, in the authentic practice of Yoga, {{it is important}} to know about small details and differences, as the effect of the practice depends on the correct performance, just like in any other technology, where you have to follow a precise plan to achieve the desired results.Although <b>Hatha-Yoga</b> has a number of straight rules, saying that retaining and controlling the sexual power is paramount for every serious aspirant, it is devoid of any dogmatic character, being an empirical science containing a wisdom that is based on the experience of the masters of yore. The strict rules serve solely for the awakening of the serpent power who is the only power that can liberate the Sadhaka from all shackles and constraints. Reinhard Gammenthaler ...|$|E
5000|$|Khane {{was born}} in Dakar, into a Sufi family. He learned yoga {{at an early age}} and became a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda. He founded the first center of the International Yoga Institute (or Institut International de Yoga) in Dakar, in 1960. In 1964, he was invited by Philippe Baumgartner, a French {{gerontologist}} and author of several books (among them, L'Homme et son Âge, Julliard, Paris, 1959; and 101 Conseils pour retrouver et développer la mémoire, Hachette, Paris, 1976, [...] ) to take part with him in several international medical conferences in order to explain and show how yoga might be helpful against the ageing process. In 1965, Baumgartner asked him to collaborate with him in the treatment of his rheumatic patients in Aix-les-Bains. Both organised later an annual course of treatment in Gorée. This collaboration lasted until the death of Baumgartner in 1980 and was very important for the genesis of the therapeutic and preventive yoga method created by Khane. Baumgartner introduced Khane in several important European yoga schools and federations who invited him soon to give often seminars and <b>hatha-yoga</b> demonstrations. In 1972, he opened his first yoga teacher training school in Switzerland. In 1974, he {{became a member of the}} pedagogic committee of the Fédération Française de Yoga (called now the FNEY). In 1978, he decided to leave this Federation and devote himself entirely to the development of the International Yoga Institute in Europe, Africa and America. His yoga school now has branches in many countries throughout the world.|$|E
5000|$|Khane wrote {{several books}} about [...] "Egyptian yoga". He claimed in those books that some <b>hatha-yoga</b> asanas were practised in ancient Egypt. Khane claims in {{addition}} that other poses represented in Egyptian temples and graves had similar effects to the Indian one {{and could be}} considered as yoga postures. As Khane mentions himself, some [...] "Egyptian" [...] postures had been taught in the past by Hanish (Mazdanan, 1932), and A. de Sambucy, who wrote in the sixties the book Le Yoga irano-égyptien. Khane built a complete pedagogic system based on the Egyptian bas-reliefs and paintings, and studied the similarities between some Egyptian words or pharaonic symbols and Indian yogic concepts. He proposes to see in Pharao {{a model of the}} human realization. The assertion made by Khane in many of his books, lectures, interviews and articles is that signs of the existence of yoga appear at approximately the same time in India and Egypt, and that the two traditions are very close, but parallel. For Khane, yoga is a universal legacy kept in life and passed down to humanity through generations by India, {{despite the fact that it}} is possible to find numerous traces of yoga in Ancient Egypt and perhaps in a few Judaeo-Christian or Islamic practices. For him what is important in the fact that yoga was practiced in Egypt, is that it is a link between several spiritual traditions and a factor of unity for humanity.The idea that yoga was practised in Ancient Egypt is now accepted by several European writers specialized in the study of the spirituality. Khane is generally accepted by other yoga schools as one of the main exponents of Egyptian yoga. Davina Delor writes : [...] "Babacar Khane est le maître contemporain révélateur du Yoga des Pharaons." [...] Gérard Blitz, former General Secretary of the European Union of National Yoga Federations (UEFNY, called now European Union of Yoga) credits him with having found the traces of the Egyptian yoga [...] "Es este hombre que se interesa al Yoga Egipcio, Yoga de el que él su esposa han vuelto a encontrar huellas en una civilización antigua de al menos seis mil anos (ver su libro : [...] "El Yoga de los Faraones" [...] and asked him to conduct several international yogic trips (1987, 1989, 1991) to Egypt under the patronage of the European Union of National Yoga Federations.In Africa, Senghor in one of his official speeches, called upon Senegalese youth and athletes to return beyond Greece to their Egyptian roots, following the path opened by Khane.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hatha-yoga</b> in Western {{culture is}} often {{perceived}} as the practice of physical exercises (practice of the asana position), usually done to improve one’s health and emotional state. Even {{if that is the}} case, it is still based on the rule of “the silencing of the modifications of the mind. ” It is about a containment of mind dispersion in terms of non-important, minute, everyday issues, which are not important for the basis of our existence, balance and inner harmony, the unity of body and mind. Even if we train only for our health and for improvement of our physical fitness, then the end result, in the case of many physical and sports activities, is stopping mind movement. The full concentration on one action, on one point in space, might not have any metaphysical meaning for us, but it still remains full concentration. This can be achieved by patiently practicing <b>hatha-yoga.</b> “Yoga is growing in popularity in Poland. As with every fashion, this leads to a number of simplifications, and sometimes even misunderstandings. Meanwhile, the book by Professor Konecki is about yoga in the context of modern culture.

40|$|The {{novelty of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the changes in cardiorespiratory and metabolic intensity brought about by the practice of pranayamas (breathing exercises of yoga) and meditation during the same <b>hatha-yoga</b> session. the technique applied was the one advocated by the <b>hatha-yoga</b> system. Nine yoga instructors-five females and four males, mean age of 44 +/- 11, 6, were subjected to analysis of the gases expired during three distinct periods of 30 min: rest, respiratory exercises and meditative practice. A metabolic open circuit computerized system was applied (VO 2000, MedGraphics-USA). the oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and the carbon dioxide output (VCO(2)) were statistically different (P <= 0. 05) during meditation and pranayama practices when compared with rest. the heart rate also suffered relevant reductions when results at rest were compared with those during meditation. A smaller proportion of lipids was metabolized during meditation practice compared with rest. the results suggest that the meditation used in this study reduces the metabolic rate whereas the specific pranayama technique in this study increases it when compared with the rest state.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} project {{is comprised of}} a written document and choreographic work. The choreographic work was presented in the Claire Trevor Theatre at the University of California, Irvine on May 6 and 7, 2014. The presentation consisted of a half-hour length contemporary ballet piece entitled "LUMINOSITY: the quality of being intellectually brilliant, enlightened, inspired" created with the intention to abstractly illustrate the journey of the mind as it transitions from a state of fluctuating, destructive chaos to quiet stillness and then from quiet stillness to brilliant, spiritual enlightenment. The supporting research paper examines {{the purpose of the}} mindful use of the breath advocated in western <b>Hatha-Yoga</b> practices and in the Pilates Method developed by Joseph H. Pilates. Breath awareness, a fundamental principle to these and many other mind-body and somatic practices, is explored to further understand the consequence an observance of the breath has on unifying the mind, body, and spirit of an individual. A particular focus is placed on the yogic philosophy that addresses the power of the breath to still fluctuations in the mind, reawaken awareness of the present moment, and deepen spirituality through that process. The philosophy of dance as a spiritual expression and healing art is addressed through the perspective of American modern dance forerunners, Ruth St. Denis and Isadora Duncan. The concepts of interiority and internal awareness are investigated throughout the choreographic process by integrating breath and meditation exercises, somatic-based improvisation, discussion, and self-reflection into each rehearsal. The choreographic investigation and findings from that study are documented in this work...|$|E
