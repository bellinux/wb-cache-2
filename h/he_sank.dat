5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|After sinking Majestic, Hersing {{took his}} {{submarine}} to refuel at a Turkish port before attempting the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. While transiting the straits, U-21 was nearly {{pulled into a}} whirlpool but the Germans managed to escape. After arriving in the Ottoman capital, the crew were given a large welcoming ceremony attended by Enver Pasha. U-21 required significant maintenance, and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out. Once the repair work was finished, U-21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol. Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage, which <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> with a single torpedo. Later on the patrol, a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U-21s periscope; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed, but doing so brought them into a minefield. One mine exploded off the U-boat's stern but it caused no significant damage, and U-21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had {{changed his name to}} Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. <b>He</b> <b>sank</b> into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E
5|$|In August, Robinson {{was sent}} to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his {{evacuation}} to England, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, {{he took over the}} coastal monitor HMS M21, in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in despatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes's operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds, and instead trained crews of coastal torpedo boats, a role which led to a distant posting in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War, fighting the Bolshevik forces along the Russian coastline. Robinson commanded a squadron of coastal torpedo boats in the Caspian and forced the surrender of several enemy forts through aggressive tactics. These achievements would later win him the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. His most notable achievement at this time was leading a small coastal motor boat inside the harbour of Fort Alexandrovsk, where <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> a barge and prompted a mass surrender from the garrison.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{imperial}} fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions {{in exchange for}} the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. <b>He</b> <b>sank</b> his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession {{in the same way as}} his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.|$|E

25|$|About Huxley himself {{we have a}} more {{complete}} record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection.

Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.|$|E

25|$|Fonti {{personally}} sank three {{ships and}} identified a wreck located 28 kilometres {{off the coast}} of Cetraro, in Calabria, by environmental workers as MV Cunsky and says <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> it himself in 1992, complete with 120 barrels of toxic and radioactive waste. He said 'Ndrangheta received £100,000 for the job. Fonti had been put on the job by his boss Sebastiano Romeo of the 'Ndrangheta clan from San Luca in collaboration with Giuseppe Giorgi. Another 'Ndrangheta boss involved was Natale Iamonte who sank ships near Melito di Porto Salvo.|$|E
25|$|The next episode {{we know of}} in Huxley's {{life when}} he {{suffered}} a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS Rattlesnake in 1848. Huxley had further periods of depression {{at the end of}} 1871, and again in 1873. Finally, in 1884 <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60. This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bi-polar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.|$|E

25|$|On 25 October, Hawkins sighted two strange vessels {{some five}} or six leagues off Pointe du Raz. Dispatch {{captured}} both, which {{proved to be the}} French gun-vessels No. 345 and No. 353. Each was armed with two brass guns, one a 32-pounder and the other a 6-pounder. Each had a crew of 20 soldiers. They had left Brest for Odierne (or Dandiorne) but the wind had blown them out to sea. Conquest arrived on the scene and then the British sighted two more gun-vessels. Dispatch captured one, No. 371, armed like the two already captured, but with a crew of 22. Hawkins thought it too dangerous to try to send the three gun-vessels to England so <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> them after having removed the guns.|$|E
25|$|The last {{blockade}} runner to make Savannah was the British {{steam ship}} Fingal. Its cargo {{of arms and}} munitions reached the entrance to Wassaw Sound {{at the mouth of}} the Savannah River on a clear night in mid November, but heavy fog in the early morning masked the ship’s progress across the bar and upriver. Later she made two unsuccessful attempts at escaping the blockade before being converted into an ironclad. Pulaski’s share on ship's manifest was two 24-pounder Blakely rifles and a large consignment of British-made Enfield infantry rifles. As the Union Flag Officer Du Pont sought to close the alternative channels local ships used, <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> stone-filled ships in the Savannah River channel, and stationed gunboats at two southerly estuaries, Wassaw Sound, south of Wilmington Island, and Ossabaw Sound at Skidaway Island.|$|E
25|$|A gifted concert violinist of {{international}} repute, her considerable talents and reputation were eventually eclipsed {{by those of}} her lover, in whose shade she appeared content to remain. In return, Pound was more loyal, not to say faithful, to her than to any of his many other mistresses. He dedicated the final stanza of his epic The Cantos to her, in homage and gratitude for her courageous and loyal support of Pound during his 13-year incarceration in a mental hospital after having been indicted for treasonous activities against the United States and in support of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime.

Tanio missed on a bank shot but the ball sank on an unintended pocket to reach the hill first; Akakariyama broke and ran out to tie the match for the last time.

25|$|The Nuggets routed the Hornets in Game 1, led by {{hometown}} player Chauncey Billups's 36 {{points in}} his playoff debut for the Nuggets. <b>He</b> <b>sank</b> a career playoff-high 8 three-pointers and added 8 assists in the game. He continued his form in Game 2, scoring 31 points as the Nuggets took a 2–0 {{lead in the}} series. The Hornets bounced back with a victory in Game 3. Game 3 was marked with plenty of fouls, {{with a total of}} 58 personal fouls in the game, resulting in four players fouling out of the game, David West and Tyson Chandler for the Hornets, and Kenyon Martin and Nenê for the Nuggets. The referees also called three flagrant fouls from James Posey, Chandler and Billups. Hornets' head coach Byron Scott was also called for a technical foul after arguing on Posey's flagrant foul.|$|E

During the combat <b>he</b> <b>sank</b> two Venetian galleys and captured three others. Still in 1539, while landing on Corfu, he encountered 12 Venetian galleys under the command of Francesco Pasqualigo and captured the galley of Antonio da Canal.
