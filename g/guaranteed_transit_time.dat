Methods: 34 patients with chronic functional constipation age 3 to 13 years and 15 controls without constipation.

The <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of {{the peak of the}} pulse varies with the central wavelength due to the etalon effects caused by the reflectivity at the air/medium boundaries.

DESIGN [...] Prospective measurement of bowel function. SETTING [...] Bristol, Avon, UK between 1987 and 1989. SUBJECTS [...] Subjects were drawn from 1897 people who comprised 72. 2 % of a stratified random sample of all men aged 40 - 69 years and women aged 25 - 69 years on the lists of 19 general medical practitioners. Altogether 1561 subjects (59. 4 %) recorded bowel function and a subsample of 98 (50 women and 48 men) had intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] The interdefecatory time interval and stool form (on a validated 1 - 6 scale sensitive to <b>transit</b> <b>time)</b> were recorded prospectively from three consecutive defecations. In the subsample the mean intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> was measured simultaneously using a four marker, two stool x ray technique. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the extent to which intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> could be predicted from the defecatory data. The formulas obtained were then applied to the whole study population. In women, intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> was best predicted by the formula 103 - 1. 23 (DF) [...] 4. 69 (SFS) + 0. 638 (IDTI), where DF is the stated defecation frequency per week, IDTI is the interdefecatory time interval, and SFS is the sum of the three stool form scores, for which the correlation coefficient r = 0. 736.

40|$|Purpose: The {{measurement}} of broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) in cancellous bone {{for the assessment}} of osteoporosis follows a parabolic-type dependence with bone volume fraction; having minima values corresponding to both entire bone and entire marrow. Langton has recently proposed that the primary BUA mechanism may be significant phase interference due to variations in propagation <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> through the test sample as detected over the phase-sensitive surface of the receive ultrasound transducer. This fundamentally simple concept assumes that the propagation of ultrasound through a complex solid : liquid composite sample such as cancellous bone may be considered by an array of parallel ‘sonic rays’. The <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of each ray is defined by the proportion of bone and marrow propagated, being a minimum (tmin) solely through bone and a maximum (tmax) solely through marrow. A <b>Transit</b> <b>Time</b> Spectrum (TTS), ranging from tmin to tmax, may be defined describing the proportion of sonic rays having a particular <b>transit</b> <b>time,</b> effectively describing lateral inhomogeneity of <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> over the surface of the receive ultrasound transducer. Phase interference may result from interaction of ‘sonic rays’ of differing <b>transit</b> <b>times.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that there is a dependence of phase interference upon the lateral inhomogenity of <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> by comparing experimental measurements and computer simulation predictions of ultrasound propagation through a range of relatively simplistic solid:liquid models exhibiting a range of lateral inhomogeneities. Methods: A range of test models was manufactured using acrylic and water as surrogates for bone and marrow respectively. The models varied in thickness in one dimension normal to the direction of propagation, hence exhibiting a range of <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> lateral inhomogeneities, ranging from minimal (single <b>transit</b> <b>time)</b> to maximal (wedge; ultimately the limiting case where each sonic ray has a unique <b>transit</b> <b>time).</b> For the experimental component of the study, two unfocused 1 MHz ¾” broadband diameter transducers were utilized in transmission mode; ultrasound signals were recorded for each of the models. The computer simulation was performed with Matlab, where the <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and relative amplitude of each sonic ray was calculated. The <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> for each sonic ray was defined as the sum of <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> through acrylic and water components. The relative amplitude considered the reception area for each sonic ray along with absorption in the acrylic.

The literature was systemically reviewed for the values of, and the variability in, gastric, small intestinal and colonic <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> under fed and fasted conditions. Meta-analysis used the "metafor" package of the R language. Meta-models of GI transit were assumed to be log-normally distributed between the studied populations. Twenty-nine studies including 125 reported {{means and standard deviations}} were used in the meta-analysis. Caloric content of administered food increased variability and delayed the gastric transit of both pellets and tablets. Conversely, food caloric content reduced the variability but had no significant influence on the mean small intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> (SITT). Food had no significant effect on the <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> through the colon. The transit of pellets through the colon was significantly slower than that of single-unit tablets which is most likely related to their smaller size.

Increased intestinal <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> affects {{a part of the}} population and is notably observed with human aging, which also corresponds to modifications of the gut microbiota. Thus we tested the metabolic and compositional changes of a human gut microbiota induced by an increased <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> simulated in vitro. Methods: The in vitro system, Environmental Control System for Intestinal Microbiota, was used to simulate the environmental conditions of 3 different anatomical parts of the human colon in a continuous process. The retention times of the chemostat conditions were established to correspond to a typical <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of 48 hours next increased to 96 hours. The bacterial communities, short chain fatty acids and metabolite fingerprints were determined. Results: Increase of <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> resulted in a decrease of biomass and of diversity in the more distal compartments. Short chain fatty acid analyses and metabolite fingerprinting revealed increased activity corresponding to carbohydrate fermentation in the proximal compartments while protein fermentations were increased in the lower parts. Conclusions: This study provides the evidence that the increase of <b>transit</b> <b>time,</b> independently of other factors, affects the composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota. The <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> is one of the factors that explain some of the modifications seen in the gut microbiota of the elderly, as well as patients with slow <b>transit</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe lungs are an {{important}} site of granulocyte pooling. The aim {{of the study is}} to quantify pulmonary vascular granulocyte <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> using deconvolution analysis, as has previously been performed to measure pulmonary red cell <b>transit</b> <b>time.</b> Granulocyte and red cell studies were performed in separate groups of patients. Both cell types were labelled with Tc- 99 m, which for granulocyte labelling was complexed with hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). The red cell impulse response function (IRF) was monoexponential with a median <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of 4 · 3 s. The granulocyte IRF was biexponential in 19 of 22 subjects, 18 of whom had systemic inflammation (inflammatory bowel disease, systemic vasculitis or graft-vs-host disease) and four were controls without inflammatory disease. The median <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> of the fast component ranged from 20 to 25 s and of the slow component 120 – 138 s in the four patient groups. The fraction of cells undergoing slow transit correlated significantly with (a) mean granulocyte <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and (b) the fraction showing shape change in vitro. We conclude that granulocyte <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> through the pulmonary circulation is bimodal and that shape-changed (activated) cells transit more slowly that non-activated cells. The size of the fraction undergoing slow transit is closely related to mean granulocyte <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and is {{an important}} determinant {{of the size of the}} pulmonary vascular granulocyte pool...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the variation associated with repeated measurement of gastrointestinal (GI) <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> {{and the effect of}} oral ranitidine on GI <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> in healthy dogs using a wireless motility capsule (WMC) system. Eight privately owned healthy adult dogs were enrolled, and one developed diarrhea and was removed from the study. For the first 3 repetitions, each dog was fed a standard meal followed by oral administration of a WMC. For the 4 th repetition, each dog was given ranitidine hydrochloride (75 [*]mg PO every 12 hours) prior to and during assessment of GI <b>transit</b> <b>times.</b> Mean between-subject coefficients of variation for gastric emptying time (GET), small and large bowel <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> (SLBTT), and total <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> (TTT) were 26. 9 %, 32. 3 %, and 19. 6 %, respectively. Mean within-subject coefficients of variation for GET, SLBTT, and TTT were 9. 3 %, 19. 6 %, and 15. 9 %, respectively. Median GET, SLBTT, and TTT without ranitidine were 719, 1, 636, and 2, 735 minutes, respectively. Median GET, SLBTT, and TTT with ranitidine were 757, 1, 227, and 2, 083 minutes, respectively. No significant differences in GI <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> were found between any of the 4 repetitions. Under these experimental conditions, no significant effects of oral ranitidine on GI <b>transit</b> <b>times</b> were observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate associations between fiber intake, colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> and stool frequency. Thirty-eight patients aged 4 to 14 years were submitted to alimentary evaluation and to measurement of colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time.</b> The median fiber intake of the total sample was age + 10. 3 g/day. Only 18. 4 % of the subjects presented a daily dietary fiber intake below the levels recommended by the American Health Foundation. In this group, the median left colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> was shorter than in the group with higher dietary fiber intake (11 vs 17 h, P = 0. 067). The correlation between stool frequency and colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> was negative and weak for left colon (r = - 0. 3, P = 0. 04), and negative and moderate for rectosigmoid and total colon (r = - 0. 5, P< 0. 001 and r = - 0. 5, P< 0. 001, respectively). The stool frequency was lower in the group with slow <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> (0. 8 vs 2. 3 per week, P = 0. 014). In conclusion, most patients with chronic functional constipation had adequate dietary fiber intake. The negative correlation between stool frequency and colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> increased progressively from proximal segments to distal segments of the colon. Patients with normal and prolonged colonic <b>transit</b> <b>time</b> differ in terms of stool frequency...|$|R
