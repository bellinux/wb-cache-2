50|$|In {{addition}} to their high life expectancy, islanders are noted for their low mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Wilcox (2007) compared age-adjusted mortality of Okinawans versus Americans and found that, during 1995, an average Okinawan was 8 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> coronary heart disease, 7 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> prostate cancer, 6.5 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> breast cancer, and 2.5 times less likely to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> colon cancer than an average American of the same age.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{many people}} think that the {{likelihood}} of <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> shark attacks is greater than that of <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> being hit by falling airplane parts, when more people actually <b>die</b> <b>from</b> falling airplane parts. When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media.|$|R

5000|$|Women fear <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> {{breast cancer}} more than <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> heart disease, even though women are eleven {{times more likely}} to <b>die</b> <b>from</b> heart disease or stroke than from breast cancer. According to {{cardiologist}} Lisa Rosenbaum, this may be because women [...] "view heart disease as the consequence of having done something bad, whereas to get breast cancer is to have something bad happen to you".|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{pressure}} volume characteristics of left lungs obtained <b>from</b> 23 babies <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> {{sudden infant death}} syndrome were compared with results from 18 length-matched babies <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> established but primarily non-pulmonary causes. Volume distension at 30 cm of water and deflation flow volume characteristics were very similar in the two groups. These findings do not suggest that babies <b>dying</b> <b>from</b> {{sudden infant death syndrome}} have abnormally stiff lungs...|$|R

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and <b>died</b> <b>from</b> ovarian cancer, while her grandmother <b>died</b> <b>from</b> ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, <b>died</b> <b>from</b> breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E

5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight.
