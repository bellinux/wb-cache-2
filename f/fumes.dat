5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and <b>fumes,</b> or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium <b>fumes</b> can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the <b>fumes,</b> with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. <b>Fumes</b> and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and <b>fumes</b> containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding <b>fumes,</b> for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A cascade {{impactor}} was em-ployed {{to separate the}} <b>fume</b> particles {{in order to determine}} the size distribution of welding <b>fume.</b> Clear images of coarse welding <b>fume</b> particles (microspatter) from scanning electron microscopy are presented. The particle size distribution of the welding <b>fume</b> reveals that gas metal arc welding (GMAW) <b>fume</b> consists pre-dominately of particle agglomerates smaller than approximately one microme-ter. Less than 10 % of the <b>fume</b> by weight is microspatter, which is larger than a mi-crometer. This fraction of microspatter does not change greatly as the GMAW pa-rameters are changed.

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic <b>fumes</b> can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the effect of silica <b>fume</b> on expansion of cement and drying shrinkage of mortars is reported. Tests were conducted on cylindrical specimens of 30 mm diameter and 30 mm height for expansion of cement pastes. The drying shrinkage of mortars was studied on bars of 25 mm square cross-section and 250 mm length. The variables of the study were percentage replacements of cement with silica <b>fume.</b> The test results indicate that the expansion of cement pastes with the incorporation of silica <b>fume</b> was less than in the ones without silica <b>fume.</b> The 28 -day drying shrinkage of mortar bars increases as does the percentage of silica <b>fume,</b> whereas the shrinkage of mortar bars at 405 days for all replacements of silica <b>fume</b> was observed to be about 2. 65 +/- 0. 11 %.

50|$|Potential {{behavioral}} {{savings from}} VAV <b>fume</b> hoods are highest when <b>fume</b> hood density (number of <b>fume</b> hoods {{per square foot}} of lab space) is high.

Put another way, savings from closing <b>fume</b> hoods can only be achieved when <b>fume</b> hood exhaust rates are greater than the air exchange rate needed to achieve the required ventilation rate in the lab room. For example, in a lab room with a required air exchange rate of 2000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), if that room has just one <b>fume</b> hood which vents air {{at a rate of}} 1000 square feet per minute, then closing the sash on the <b>fume</b> hood will simply cause the lab room's air handler to increase from 1000 CFM to 2000 CFM, thus resulting in no net reduction in air exhaust rates, and thus no net reduction in energy consumption.|$|R
