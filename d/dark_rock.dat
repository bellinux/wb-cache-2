5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented <b>dark</b> <b>rock,</b> polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The tiny islets {{this species}} inhabits around Dinagat provide {{striking}} micro-habitats, often having near-vertical rock walls and highly vegetated tops. Here, N.viridis plants occasionally grow lithophytically, their roots anchored in fissures. Where present, surrounding vegetation provides {{support for the}} plants' scrambling vines, though these may overhang the sheer rock faces, dangling only a few metres from the water. Exposed to direct sunlight, the <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> walls can get very hot, and during particularly dry periods any N.viridis plants in close proximity will largely wither, leaving only a few green shoots.|$|E

Recording sessions began in October 2001 and initially {{she intended to}} record in Chicago, Illinois, but those plans were later abandoned. Although each session had individual engineers, Auf der Maur and Chris Goss were primary producers of the project. Auf der Maur also financed the recording sessions herself, as she was not signed to a record label at the time. She also self-financed the sessions to [...] "secure creative control" [...] as she [...] "wanted the foundation of it to be really pure." [...] Describing the recording process, Auf der Maur said: [...] "The L.A. section of the record is the prettier, more ethereal stuff [...] the <b>dark,</b> <b>rock</b> stuff actually –– which is really my main route and the muscle of the record –– was recorded in Canada. And then in Chicago we're recording some songs with James and Chris that are more mid-dissonant pop –– mid-tempo, mid-volume." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "retro-metal" [...] {{has been}} applied to such bands as The Darkness, whose unique mix of glam rock and heavy riffs earned them a string of singles hits and a quintuple {{platinum}} album with One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back (2005), which reached number 11. Bullet for My Valentine, from Wales, broke into the top 5 in both the U.S. and British charts with their melodic <b>dark</b> <b>rock,</b> with Scream Aim Fire (2008). Asking Alexandria's third studio album, From Death to Destiny, also debuted in the top five of the Billboard 200 during the week it was released, while also debuting at number 1 in both the British Rock and Metal charts.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the 69 Eyes' music {{style was}} of glam metal {{influenced}} by acts such as Mötley Crüe and Hanoi Rocks. However, {{they began to}} incorporate more influence from gothic rock bands such as The Mission, The Cult, [...] The Sisters of Mercy and The Lords of the New Church. Their sound {{was described as a}} mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered rock 'n' roll. Their music continued to show further influence from other rock artists such as The Doors, Elvis Presley, and Billy Idol as well as vampire films and literature. The term [...] "goth 'n roll" [...] is used by fans to describe their style. [...] They are often described as a <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> band, a term which the band has embraced. In recent times, with the release of Back in Blood, The 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar-based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.|$|E
2500|$|The pipa {{has also}} been used in rock music; the California-based band Incubus {{featured}} one, borrowed from legendary guitarist Steve Vai, in their 2001 song [...] "Aqueous Transmission," [...] as played by the group's guitarist, Mike Einziger. [...] The Shanghai progressive/folk-rock band Cold Fairyland, which was formed in 2001, also use pipa (played by Lin Di), sometimes multi-tracking it in their recordings. [...] Australian <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> band The Eternal use the pipa in their song [...] "Blood" [...] as played by singer/guitarist Mark Kelson on their album Kartika. Other musicians who released albums featuring Yang Jing on pipa include Swiss jazz group 4tett, Pierre Favre, Wolfgang Sieber, and Miki Minoru. [...] The instrument is also played by musician Min Xiaofen in I See Who You Are, a song from Björk's album Volta. [...] Western performers of pipa include French musician Djang Si'an 张思安 (Jean-Sébastien Héry), who created a new style of playing for pipa and zhongruan instruments by integrating jazz and rock concepts to the instrument such as power chords and walking bass.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{referred}} {{to the music of}} HIM as gothic rock, gothic metal, alternative rock, alternative metal, and <b>dark</b> <b>rock.</b> The band themselves {{have referred}} to their music as [...] "love metal", the title of their fourth studio album. According to Ville Valo, the term [...] "love metal" [...] was coined as a response to people having difficulties categorizing their music. In regards to HIM being labeled a [...] "goth band", Valo responded by stating: [...] "We can't do anything about that , but I think we are a special shade of goth, more tender than others. In Finnish tradition, our music is very melancholic." [...] Valo has described HIM's sound as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music". According to Valo, since the beginning the band's intent was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences. Valo has often cited Black Sabbath and Type O Negative as HIM's biggest influences. Some of the band's further influences include Paradise Lost, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Cathedral, Electric Wizard, Monster Magnet and Norwegian black metal. Regarding HIM's sound, Valo has also stated that: [...] "We never tried to claim that we have reinvented the wheel of rock 'n' roll. We've always been proud to be the torchbearers for Sabbath, Type O, Paradise Lost and Anathema, and a lot of those bands." ...|$|E
60|$|There, upon huge {{pedestals}} of <b>dark</b> <b>rock,</b> sculptured with rude {{emblems of}} the Phallic worship, separated {{from each other}} by a distance of forty paces, and looking down the road which crossed some sixty miles of plain to Loo, were three colossal seated forms--two male and one female--each measuring about thirty feet from the crown of its head to the pedestal.|$|E
60|$|Blinks of {{sunshine}} touched the lower {{face of the}} crag, and in their track the <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> glittered with a steely luster, but trails of mist rolled among the crannies above. Below, a precipitous slope of small stones that the dalesmen call a scree ran down to a hollow strewn with broken rocks, and across this he could distinguish the blurred flat top of another height.

60|$|The sharp hiss {{the steel}} runners made was louder, the wind began to scream, {{and she got}} {{something}} of a shock when she cautiously looked up. It {{was hard to see}} through the snowy spray, but the top of the crag looked ominously near. Glancing down hill with smarting eyes, she thought the slope, which, from the top, had seemed to fall evenly to the dale, was also inclined towards the crag. She could not see much of the latter, but there was a fringe of <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> where the white declivity broke off.|$|E

No one came to him, but the silent Brownies who brought his daily food; and with bitter tears he wept for Lily-Bell, mourning his cruelty and selfishness, seeking to do some kindly deed that might atone for his wrong-doing.|$|E

60|$|He {{felt more}} cheerful now. It {{looked as if}} the end of his long search were near, since there was every reason to believe he would join the men before they could test the claim. On the second day he laboriously ascended a steep slope leading out of a valley he had followed, a broken line of {{footprints}} running upward in front of him. This seemed to indicate that the great ridge ahead could be crossed, though when he glanced at the ramparts of <b>dark</b> <b>rock</b> the task looked insuperable.

Then they tried roast lynx and ate a little, and finished with some scraps of cheese and deep draughts of hot water. Then--oh Tyburnia and Chelsea and all that is becoming!--they smoked Trafford's pipe for alternate minutes, and Marjorie found great comfort in it.|$|E

Lucy, however, was keen on going on, and by and by one of the guides picked out a coulee that might take us up. Coulee's good French-Canadian, but Alpinists call it a couloir. It looked like a thin, white, perpendicular streak on the face of the <b>dark</b> <b>rock.</b> But perhaps I'm boring you with these particulars." ...|$|E

60|$|Stinging frost set in, and on {{the morning}} they cleared the ground for the first post Charnock felt daunted as he beat his numbed hands.

The roof had fallen in, and vines filled the interior. In front of the door and all about, lumps of reddish, rusty-looking rock were scattered.
