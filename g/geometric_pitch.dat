40|$|We study {{experimentally}} how two key <b>geometric</b> parameters (<b>pitch</b> and gas fraction) of textured hydrophobic surfaces affect liquid slip. The two are independently controlled on precisely fabricated microstructures of {{posts and}} grates, and the slip length {{of water on}} each sample is measured using a rheometer system. The slip length increases linearly with the pitch but dramatically with the gas fraction above 90 %, the latter trend being more pronounced on posts than on grates. Once the surfaces are designed for very large slips (> 20 μm), however, further increase is not obtained in regular practice because the meniscus loses its stability. By developing near-perfect samples that delay {{the transition from a}} dewetted (Cassie) to a wetted (Wenzel) state until near the theoretical limit, we achieve giant slip lengths, as large as 185 μm. © 2008 The American Physical Society...|$|R

Molecular dynamics simulations and tight-binding calculations have demonstrated the structural stability of CNCs; they have higher cohesive energy (~ 7.4 eV/atom) than that of C 60 (7.29 eV/atom) [10, 13]. Electronic properties of CNCs including band structures and density of states were investigated using a tight-binding model [11, 14], and it was predicted that some carbon nanocoils could be semi-metals, in contrast to the conventionally semiconducting and metallic behavior known for the straight carbon nanotubes.|$|R
40|$|Spirally {{corrugated}} tube {{is one of}} the most important parts of coaxial heat exchangers. It can greatly improve the heat transfer efficiency of heat exchangers. Here, a novel spirally {{corrugated tube}} with six-start is proposed. However, up to now, there is little literature about the heat transfer performance and flow field of this novel six-start spirally corrugated tube. In this paper, the effects of <b>geometric</b> parameters (<b>pitch</b> p, corrugation depth e), Reynolds number Re and fluid properties on the heat transfer performances are investigated based on the validated numerical model. The results show that with the increasing of pitch p, both the heat transfer coefficient h and Nusselt number Nu decrease gradually. Meanwhile, with the increasing of corrugation depth e, both the secondary flow velocity vxy and the vorticity of longitudinal vortex increase gradually. Moreover, under the same working condition, the heat transfer performances of the six-start spirally corrugated tube are affected by both the working medium and Reynolds number. Finally, a criterion correlation for heat transfer calculation in the six-start spirally corrugated tube is proposed and validated to be reliable and suitable. This work can reveal the enhanced heat transfer mechanism of the six-start spirally corrugated tube and benefit the further research on heat transfer characteristics of multi-start spirally corrugated tube or other related devices...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{characteristics}} of wing-in-ground effect propulsors were investigated using a comparative analysis of thrust and powering characteristics between wing-in-ground (WIG) effect thrusters and traditional screw propellers. WIG thrusters {{were found to}} have constant thrust production and efficiency, nearly independent of speed of advance, as contrary to screw propellers, whose optimum efficiency occurs at only one speed point. To produce the same amount of thrust as equivalent screw propellers, WIG thrusters have to work under heavily loaded operating conditions. WIG thrusters were also found to produce a relatively lower but nearly constant efficiency and thrust, independent of speed. Another distinguishing propulsion characteristic revealed for WIG thrusters is that they are capable of operating at much higher speeds, in a range of three to six times that of screw propellers of the same size. While the speed range of screw propellers is mainly limited by their <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch,</b> the speed range of WIG thrusters has no speed limit in ideal fluid. In reality, the speed range is only limited by viscous drag and cavitation, or compressibility, in water or air, respectively. This suggests a potential for WIG thrusters of higher speed application than screw propellers.

40|$|The aeropropulsive {{characteristics}} of an advanced twin-engine fighter aircraft designed for supersonic cruise {{have been studied}} in the Langley 16 -Foot Tansonic Tunnel and the Lewis 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Tunnel. The objective was to determine multiaxis control-power characteristics from thrust vectoring. A two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzle was designed to provide yaw vector angles of 0, - 10, and - 20 deg combined with <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch</b> vector angles of 0 and 15 deg. Yaw thrust vectoring was provided by yaw flaps located in the nozzle sidewalls. Roll control was obtained from differential pitch vectoring. This investigation was conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 20 to 2. 47. Angle of attack was varied from 0 to about 19 deg, and nozzle pressure ratio was varied from about 1 (jet off) to 28, depending on Mach number. Increments in force or moment coefficient that result from pitch or yaw thrust vectoring remain essentially constant over the entire angle-of-attack range of all Mach numbers tested. There was no effect of pitch vectoring on the lateral aerodynamic forces and moments and only very small effects of yaw vectoring on the longitudinal aerodynamic forces and moments. This result indicates little cross-coupling of control forces and moments for combined pitch-yaw vectoring...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the static test facility of the Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to evaluate the internal performance of a nonaxisymmetric convergent divergent nozzle designed to have simultaneous pitch and yaw thrust vectoring capability. This concept utilized divergent flap deflection for thrust vectoring in the pitch plane and flow-turning deflectors installed within the divergent flaps for yaw thrust vectoring. Modifications consisting of reducing the sidewall length and deflecting the sidewall outboard were investigated as means to increase yaw-vectoring performance. This investigation studied the effects of multiaxis (pitch and yaw) thrust vectoring on nozzle internal performance characteristics. All tests were conducted with no external flow, and nozzle pressure ratio was varied from 2. 0 to approximately 13. 0. The results indicate that this nozzle concept can successfully generate multiaxis thrust vectoring. Deflection of the divergent flaps produced resultant pitch vector angles that, although dependent on nozzle pressure ratio, were nearly equal to the <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch</b> vector angle. Losses in resultant thrust due to pitch vectoring were small or negligible. The yaw deflectors produced resultant yaw vector angles up to 21 degrees that were controllable by varying yaw deflector rotation. However, yaw deflector rotation resulted in significant losses in thrust ratios and, in some cases, nozzle discharge coefficient. Either of the sidewall modifications generally reduced these losses and increased maximum resultant yaw vector angle. During multiaxis (simultaneous pitch and yaw) thrust vectoring, little or no cross coupling between the thrust vectoring processes was observed...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement {{technology has}} been widely used in heat exchangers. The six-start spirally corrugated tube is a novel heat transfer tube, and its flow resistance characteristics have not been studied. In this paper, the flow resistance characteristics of the six-start spirally corrugated tube are studied. Specifically, the effect of influencing factors such as <b>geometric</b> parameters (<b>pitch</b> and corrugation depth), fluid properties and Reynolds number on flow resistance of the six-start spirally corrugated tube are studied. The results show that, firstly, the six-start spirally corrugated tube has a better heat transfer performance than both the circular tube and four-start spirally corrugated tube, and its flow resistance is situated between circular tube and four-start spirally corrugated tube. Secondly, with the increasing of the pitch p of the six-start spirally corrugated tube, both the pressure drop ΔP and resistance coefficient f are decreasing gradually. Thirdly, the increase of corrugation depth e {{can lead to a}} large flow resistance, so it is not recommended to adopt an excessive increase in the corrugation depth e. The effect of fluid properties on flow resistance in tube is not obvious, and the changing rate of ratio fe/fs of all working media are almost the same. Moreover, with the increasing of Reynolds number Re, resistance coefficient f both in the six-start spirally corrugated tube and circular tube are decreasing gradually. Finally, based on the above research data, the criterion correlation for flow resistance calculation in the six-start spirally corrugated tube is obtained. It can be concluded that the six-start spirally corrugated tube studied in this paper has a smaller flow resistance than the commonly used four-start spirally corrugated tube. This work can provide some advices for the future research of reducing flow resistance in spirally corrugated tube or other related devices...|$|R

The study was conducted on a set of three-dimensional finite element design models. A dimension less Stress Transfer Parameter (STP) was utilized for gauging the performances of the different screws according to its load sharing capabilities. Stress-transfer behavior was found to be linear for varying load magnitudes. The <b>geometric</b> properties investigated; <b>pitch,</b> thread length, width, major diameter and thread angle showed different influences on the three different profiles studied (triangular, trapezoidal and rectangular).

The best design was of the rectangular profile (Design no. 24) with an STP value of 0. 4344. It was concluded that the best biomechanical properties were found in rectangular screw profiles.

In this work, we present {{the performance of}} a pixelated Schottky Al/p-CdTe/Pt detector (4 × 4) coupled to a custom-designed digital readout electronics for high flux measurements. The detector (4 × 4 × 2 mm 3) has an anode layout based on an array of 16 pixels with a <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch</b> of 1 mm (pixel size of 0. 6 mm). The 4 -channel readout electronics is able to continuously digitize and process the signals from each pixel, performing multi-parameter analysis (event arrival time, pulse shape, pulse height, pulse time width, etc.) even at high fluxes and at different throughput and energy resolution conditions. The spectroscopic response of the system to monochromatic X-ray sources, at both low and high rates, is presented with particular attention to the mitigation of some typical spectral distortions (pile-up, baseline shifts and charge sharing). At a photon counting rate of 520 kcps/pixel, the system exhibits an energy resolution (FWHM at 59. 5 keV) of 4. 6 %, 7. 1 % and 9 % at throughputs of 0. 9 %, 16 % and 82 %, respectively. Measurements of Ag-target X-ray spectra also show the ability of the system to perform accurate estimation of the input counting rate up to 1. 1 Mcps/pixel.

The good room temperature performance and the high spatial resolution of pixellated CdZnTe detectors make them very attractive in space-borne x-ray astronomy, mainly as focal plane detectors for {{the new generation of}} hard x-ray focusing telescopes. In this work, we investigated on the spectroscopic performance of two pixellated CdZnTe detectors coupled with a custom low noise and low power readout application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The detectors (10 × 10 × 1 and 10 × 10 × 2 mm^ 3 single crystals) have an anode layout based on an array of 256 pixels with a <b>geometric</b> <b>pitch</b> of 0. 5 mm. The ASIC, fabricated in 0. 8 µm BiCMOS technology, is equipped with eight independent channels (preamplifier and shaper) and characterized by low power consumption (0. 5 mW/channel) and low noise (150 – 500 electrons rms). The spectroscopic results point out the good energy resolution of both detectors at room temperature [5. 8 % full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 59. 5 keV for the 1 mm thick detector; 5. 5 % FWHM at 59. 5 keV for the 2 mm thick detector) and low tailing in the measured spectra, confirming the single charge carrier sensing properties of the CdZnTe detectors equipped with a pixellated anode layout. Temperature measurements show optimum performance of the system (detector and electronics) at T= 10 °C and performance degradation at lower temperatures.

These tests revealed that the double-barreled configuration induced error in its steady state measurement at zero incidence that increased consistently with jet Mach number to 1. 1 % at Mach 0. 9. For all Mach numbers, the double-barreled probe nulled at a pitch angle of approximately 7 degrees and provided inconsistent measurements when yawed. The double-barreled probe provided adequate measurements via both its steady state and high response tubes (within +/- 0. 15 % accuracy) over unacceptable ranges of biased pitch and inconsistent yaw angles which varied with Mach number. By comparison, the coannular probe provided accurate measurements (at zero incidence) for all jet Mach numbers as well as over a flow angularity range which varied from +/- 25. 8 degrees at Mach 0. 3 to +/- 14. 2 degrees at Mach 0. 9.

40|$|An {{intriguing}} {{perspective is}} presented in studying the stability robustness of systems with multiple rationally independent and uncertain delays. The problem {{is known to be}} notoriously complex due to the infinite dimensionality of the system. The process starts with a holographic class coordinate transformation from the delay space to a new set of coordinates. This mapping reduces the dimension of the problem from infinity to a manageably small number. Furthermore it confines the domain of study within a finite dimensional cube with edges of length 2 π in the newly introduced domain, what we call the building block. In essence, the mapping collapses the entire set of potential stability switching points onto a small number of building hypersurfaces (upperbounded by n 2, where n is the dimension of the dynamics). We further demonstrate that these building hypersurfaces can be implicitly defined and they are completely isolated within the above mentioned cube. It is also shown that the detection of these building hypersurfaces is necessary and sufficient in order to arrive at the complete stability robustness picture we seek. This novel perspective serves very well for the preparatory steps of our group 2 ̆ 7 s recent paradigm called Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR). As the 2 ̆ 2 building block 2 ̆ 2 concept is valid for the most general class of linear time-invariant, multiple time-delayed systems (LTI-MTDS), this work contains the first treatment of n-dimensional p-time delay cases in full rigor. ^ This unique methodology is then utilized to assess the stability of regenerative chatter of non-uniform pitch milling process. With this method and a complementary numerical routine, we provide a process optimization scheme. The end result is a powerful tool to determine some important selections of the milling operation: (i) <b>geometric</b> selection: the <b>pitch</b> angle selection of the tool and, (ii) operational selection: the optimum cutting conditions (i. e., depth of cut and the spindle speeds), for maximizing the metal removal rate while avoiding the onset of undesired regenerative chatter. A case study is provided which displays the capabilities of the technique, as well as a comparison with other numerical approaches to show the advantages of the Building Block concept. ...|$|R
