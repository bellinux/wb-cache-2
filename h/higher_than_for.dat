As {{a result of}} the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League when the average player wage was £75,000 per year. The average salary stands at £1.1million as of the 2008–09 season. As of 2015, average salaries in the Premier League are <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> any other football league in the world.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes is <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> other Banksia species {{with which it}} occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E

25|$|From {{a sample}} of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River {{examined}} between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and is much <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>for</b> other cetaceans and {{for the majority of}} terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals.

This condition is thought to be directly related to environmental contamination, in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with the high incidence of this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary are having a direct carcinogenic effect or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants' resistance to the disease.|$|E

For uniform distribution, in case of I/B WMN, the throughput of EDCA {{is a little bit}} <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> Hybrid WMN.
