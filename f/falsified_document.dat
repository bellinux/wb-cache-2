50|$|In the 12th century, Horn had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention {{in connection with}} the noble family that bore the same name, but it seems that the actual “first mention” in 1135 is a <b>falsified</b> <b>document.</b> Nevertheless, a genuine document from 1166 has the same contents and names the same persons, thus confirming the 12th century, at least, as the earliest time when the village is known to have existed.|$|E
5000|$|According to a later <b>falsified</b> <b>document</b> {{of bishop}} Pelagius of Oviedo, Alfonso III held a council at Oviedo in 899 or 900 {{and with the}} {{approval}} of a certain [...] "Pope John" [...] (perhaps John VIII was intended) raised Oviedo to metropolitan rank. A document dated 20 January 905 in Pelagius's Liber testamentorum records a large donation made by the monarch to the see of Oviedo and confirmed by Gomelo II. This document is strongly suspect.|$|E
50|$|Between 1941 and 1942, her {{section was}} {{destroyed}} by the Germans. The outcome of this action were the numerous arrests of underground activists. Irena was arrested by the Gestapo on 7 October 1942. They placed her at Pawiak. She underwent harsh interrogations but revealed nothing. Other colleagues, knowing her role in intelligence, sent her a vial of cyanide, but she didn't use it. Her husband arranged {{for her to be}} freed from prison. A bribed guard put her in the group of non-political prisoners to be transported to the Majdanek camp. While there, a group of NSZ fighters from Pomerania freed her from the camp. Dressed in Gestapo uniforms, they came to the camp and presented a <b>falsified</b> <b>document</b> saying that Irena was to be brought to Warsaw for more interrogation. This event was documented in a Delegatura Rządu report.|$|E

50|$|Sankt Julian was {{mentioned}} in a 1290 document as “apud Sanctam Julianam” (Latin for “at Saint Juliana’s”), and therefore, despite the name’s masculine appearance and sound, {{the village is}} in fact named after a saint named Juliana, who is worshipped at the village’s church. There are several saints named Juliana, but the old patronage for Sankt Julian’s church could only have referred to Juliana of Nicomedia, who during her long martyrdom had molten lead poured over her. According to a <b>falsiﬁed</b> <b>document</b> dated to 1192, “Saint Julien” {{might have been the}} church’s namesake saint, and indeed the village maintains a partnership with one of the many places in France named Saint-Julien (to wit, the one in Côte-d’Or). Sankt Julian may well once have borne another name that the brisk pilgrimage in Saint Juliana’s pushed aside when the name was changed. If so, the old name is now forgotten. After 1290, the following forms of the name crop up in the record: ecclesiae sanctae Julianae (1336), ecclesiae de sancta Juliana (1340), zu sant Juliana (14th century), Sanct Julian (1588) and Sanct Juljan (1686). In the local speech, the village is also called “Dilje”.|$|E
5000|$|If Trajan's {{adoption}} of Hadrian was genuine, it {{came too late}} to dissuade other potential claimants. Hadrian's rivals were Trajan's closest friends, the most experienced and {{senior members of the}} imperial council. Compared to them Hadrian was only an upstart. Hadrian could not count on [...] "inside" [...] support from fellow senators, and had to find political friends elsewhere to secure his newly won position. According to Historia Augusta, Hadrian simply informed the Senate of his accession in a letter as a fait accompli, and that [...] "the unseemly haste of the troops in acclaiming him emperor was due to the belief that the state could not be without an emperor". Hadrian quickly secured the support of the legions. One potential opponent, the Moorish prince and outstanding general Lusius Quietus, was promptly dismissed. By taking his personal guard of Moorish auxiliaries from Quietus Hadrian could safely relieve him of his post as governor of Judea later. The Senate's endorsement followed when possibly falsified papers of adoption from Trajan were presented. According to these papers, Hadrian had been adopted in absentia on 9 August 117 (Trajan having died on 8 August), which was technically irregular, as the two parties concerned were required to be present at the ceremony. The rumour of a <b>falsified</b> <b>document</b> of adoption carried little weight, as Hadrian's legitimacy arose from the endorsement of the Senate - and above all from the support of the Syrian armies. Nevertheless, various public ceremonies were organized - Egyptian papyri tell of one organized between 117 and 118 CE - extolling the fact that Hadrian had been divinely chosen by his deified father and by the gods themselves.|$|E
