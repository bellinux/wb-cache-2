50|$|In this assay, the copper(II) binds with nitrogens {{present in}} the {{peptides}} of proteins. In a secondary reaction, the copper(II) is reduced to copper(I). Buffers, such as Tris and ammonia interfere with this assay, therefore rendering this assay inappropriate for protein samples purified from ammonium sulfate precipitation. Due to its insensitivity and little <b>interference</b> by <b>free</b> amino acids, this assay is most useful for whole tissue samples and other sources with high protein concentration.|$|R

50|$|ANT uses an {{adaptive}} isochronous network technology to ensure coexistence with other ANT devices. This scheme provides {{the ability for}} each transmission to occur in an <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> time slot within the defined frequency band. The radio transmits for less than 150 µs per message, allowing a single channel to be divided into hundreds of time slots. The ANT messaging period (the time between each node transmitting its data) determines how many time slots are available.|$|E
30|$|If the {{employed}} pulse has {{a spectrum}} that is restrictively limited within the increased subcarrier spacing, no spectra-crossing happens between adjacent subcarriers, which confirms an inter-carrier <b>interference</b> (ICI) <b>free</b> transmission. Thus, the orthogonality condition (5) is {{changed to a}} one-dimension only, i.e., any traditional Nyquist pulse can be used. This {{can be interpreted as}} an alternative way to relax the orthogonality condition. Moreover, like OQAM, the FMT only holds a perfect reconstruction in the distortion-free case as well.|$|R

Measurements of time waveforms and spectra of incandescent lamps, tubular and compact fluorescent lamps with conventional and electronic ballasts, as well as Light Emitting Diodes are discussed and compared to other works...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{family of}} inter-symbol <b>interference</b> (ISI) <b>free</b> pulses {{generated}} by improved Nyquist filters with a frequency characteristic composed of six parabolic pieces is proposed. We studied {{the performance of}} the new pulses in terms of the ISI error probability when the impulse response is sampled with a timing offset. To illustrate the achieved improvement, the new pulses are compared with other performing pulses that were reported in the literature. Simulation results show that comparable or enhanced ISI performance can be obtained at reasonable complexity...|$|R

50|$|Video senders {{that operate}} on {{existing}} Wi-Fi networks {{have recently been}} developed and provide another <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> method of transmitting audio and video. Bandwidth over the Wi-Fi network will be shared between the video sender and all other connected devices, which can cause issues when used with older networking technologies, however {{this is not a}} problem with more recent 802.11n and 802.11ac technologies as the available bandwidth is so high. Due {{to the fact that they}} operate on the local Wi-Fi network, their range is limited, however Wi-Fi based video senders also allow for other interesting technologies to be included. These include technologies that allow for mobile device screen-mirroring, such as Miracast and Airplay, as well as media streaming features such as DLNA.|$|E

In this paper, we focus on the downlink and compare the downlink CIBS-CDMA system employing an MUl-free receiver with the conventional downlink Direct-Sequence (DS) CDMA system employing a chip equalizer receiver. The analysis, which is validated by simulation results, reveals that CIBS-CDMA with an MUI-free receiver has a number of advantages over DS-CDMA with a chip equalizer receiver...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is the {{evaluation}} of the analytical characteristics of the determinations performed using glucose oxidase and acetylcholinesterase based electrochemical sensors, developed applying original or optimized conventional methods of enzyme immobilization. It was found that the sensitivity of glucose determination, for example, varies from 0. 048 to 3. 36 mA L mol- 1 cm- 2 and the response time of the glucose oxidase based sensors - from 5 to 30 s, according to the method of the bioreceptor immobilization. The sensitivity of the analysis is affected from the activity of the immobilized biocomponent, from the composition of the solution (concentration of the substrate, of the mediator and of the inhibitor), and from the experimental conditions (pH, temperature, agitation), {{as well as from the}} kinetic parameters of the studied process. It was found that the immobilized glucose oxidase conserves its substrate specificity in the presence of a number of glucides (galactose, maltose, fructose, and saccharose) in 100 fold higher concentrations. The selectivity of glucose analysis is ensured applying a suitable potential. <b>Interferences</b> <b>free</b> glucose amperometric determination was performed at 0. 00 V/SCE, in the presence of ascorbates and urates.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} amounts of {{interference}} that can affect BIRS' measurements, several methods had to be employed to process the data. Data had to first be fed to a preamplifier and slope filter to prevent interference from overloading the signal and drowning out the desired information. The signal could then be amplified and fed to a commercially bought spectrum analyzer which selects 128 relatively <b>interference</b> <b>free</b> frequencies to observe every 3 seconds for half an hour. The frequencies below 20 MHz are largely used for international communications, so the system needed to adapt its filters every {{half an hour to}} effectively remove the interference. The antenna used the galactic background radiation for calibration. The BIRS is oriented to point almost directly at the galactic south pole, so background is measured at that point for calibration.|$|E

This implies that economic rents, i.e. profits generated {{from a lack of}} perfect competition, must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.|$|R

By contrast to the standard Mach-Zehnder realization, our device does not contain an etched region inside the interference loop.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE) can be {{implemented}} in a Linear Peri-odic Time-Varying Multiple Access (LPTVMA) system. As-suming quasi-synchronous users, LPTVMA systems {{can be considered as}} Multi User <b>Interference</b> (MUI) <b>free</b> systems. Hence LPTVMA systems can be equalized. In multipath channels the equalization step uses a Zero Padding (ZP) tech-nique. The equivalent channel to equalize is a zero-pad chan-nel. For such zero-pad channels the MLSE can be efficiently implemented by using a parallel trellis Viterbi algorithm. The complexity of the MLSE can be further reduced because the padding zeros have known positions in the received sig-nal. The proposed MLSE uses a periodic time-varying trel-lis. Thus the number of states of the MLSE can be reduced. The performances of LPTVMA systems using the proposed MLSE are evaluated by simulations. 1...|$|R
