40|$|A field-oriented {{sedimentation}} {{study was}} conducted at Blind Pass Florida, shortly after the last channel dredging {{in the summer of}} 2000. Blind Pass is a wave-dominated tidal inlet that has been migrating southward for over 3, 000 meters before it was stabilized by a series of hard-engineering structures since 1937. Thereafter, the inlet has been maintained by frequent dredging. The dredged material was typically used to nourish the adjacent beaches, especially the downdrift Upham Beach. T ime-series measurements of tidal currents and bathymetry were conducted in the inlet channel. The ebb-dominated main channel, roughly 6 m deep, extends along the southern side, where peak <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> approached 150 cm/s. Along the northern side of the inlet, the ebb curre nts are much weaker, as compared to both the flood current and <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> in the main channel. Shortly after the 2000 dredging, rapid sedimentation was measured along the northern side of the inlet. This accumulation is likely resulted from the predominant southward longshore sand transport, bypassi ng the north jetty. The northern part of the inlet is dominated by flood-directed current and the weak <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> is not adequate to flush the bypassed sediment out of the inlet. Along the southern side with the deep channel, active sediment flushing is evident as indicated by the coarse, shelly lag deposit on the bottom.

These simulations are conducted for four distinct periods where markedly different river discharge and tides occurred, and the outputs are compared to time series measurements and synoptic thermohaline data. The model reveals its ability in reproducing observed temporal variability in sea level height and along-channel velocity, presenting skill coefficients higher than 0. 85. The model qualitatively reproduces along-channel thermohaline distributions at three different vertical levels, during low-to-medium river inflow, underestimating the salinity stratification when the river flow is high (higher than View the MathML source). In general, the trends inferred from the observations are reproduced by the numerical model. The cross-sectional tidally averaged structure of salinity and longitudinal velocity analyzed near the channel's mouth reveals <b>ebb</b> residual <b>currents</b> at the south shore and flood residual currents at the north shore under low-to-medium river discharge.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Presentation date: 1979 - 04 - 30 The {{ocean wave}} {{conditions}} {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River have long proven a hazard to ship navigation. Over 62 major shipwrecks have occurred at, or in the vicinity of the river entrance. The wave pattern is extremely complex, varying seasonally with prevailing winds and river discharge, as well as the tidal cycle. Analysis of the cornplex wave refraction process requires repetitive wave crest mapping at critical periods such as peak <b>ebb</b> <b>current,</b> winter storms, and spring ti des. Oregon Army National Guard Mohawk aircraft equipped with the AN/APQ- 94 Side Looking Airborne Radar system have overcome most of the monitoring limitations, providing scheduling flexibility, cloud penetration, and a constant angle of illumination, although the scanning nature of the system requires a correction for the progression of the wave crest between scans. This correction was accomplished by adding the resultant vectors of apparent wave refraction patterns obtained from a given flight to those of a subsequent flight flown imediately after, at a reciprocal azimuth. SLAR imagery interpretation and analysis was aided by color density slicing, which enables differences in wave steepness and height to be detected. Wave crest patterns from the imagery were traced on an equivalent scale as previous wave pattern predictions, enabling easy comparison. The use of photographic enlargements of the SLAR imagery was used in conjunction with weather and sea data, in aiding further exploitation of the imagery to aid the understanding of wave action when storm produced swell encounters strong <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> velocities seaward of the river entrance.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{analysis}} of the flow in tidal flats is essential to understanding the hydrodynamics of estuarine areas {{in the presence of}} macrotides. The river flow influence on tidal flats hydrodynamics is a rarely subject addressed in the literature. This numerical study was developed in the final stretch of the North Channel of the Amazon River, where a detail modeling was used to characterize the flow in the flooded regions due the tides. The tides control the water levels fluctuations, velocities and times of flooding and exposition inside the flats. The effect of river flow is only noticed in the upstream tidal flats, through changes in mean water levels, flats widths and velocities patterns, dampening the flood currents and amplifying the ebb's. The flats were classified as flood-dominant systems, although the main channel has dominance in the <b>ebb</b> <b>currents</b> due to the presence of river flow.

ST 01 occurs during a neap tide (range 1. 0 m) when peak currents through the inlet are at a minimum, allowing wave action to move sediment onshore from the ebb delta, reducing inlet cross section and promoting closure.

For this reason, the understanding of the sedimentary transport is important to estimate the future evolution of this site. This study combines acoustic data (side-scan sonar, single- and multibeam, acoustic doppler current profiler), current modeling and grain-size analysis of surficial sediment samples to evaluate the relative contribution of the hydrodynamic and morphological effects on the sedimentary transport in the area. The hydrodynamic results show a dominance of the flood tidal current for the entire study area. However, locally near the Scheldt Estuary, the <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> dominates as an effect of the Scheldt outflow. Based on the grain-size analysis, a sediment map is made in combination with the seabed morphology and permits a classification of 5 sediment types. The residual sediment transport, based on the grain-size data, is estimated by a numerical model (Gao and Collins, 1991) and is related to seabed features observed on the acoustic data (side-scan sonar and multibeam).

40|$|Abstract: Hypothetical eastward {{relocation}} of Fire Island Inlet is examined as a thought exercise in regional sediment management. Subjects considered include morphologic {{behavior of the}} inlet, hydrodynamics of the present and hypothetical relocated inlet, collapse of the existing ebb-tidal shoal and formation of new ebb and flood shoals, sand bypassing, navigability, and stability of the beaches east and west of the inlet. The relocated inlet would be more hydraulically efficient than the present inlet, increasing tidal exchange (prism), promoting circulation in Great South Bay, and increasing sand storage in the inlet shoals. Collapse of the abandoned ebb shoal would feed the eroding beaches to the west, such as Gilgo Beach, for 50 - 100 years. Oak Beach would no longer experience an erosional <b>ebb</b> <b>current</b> and wave action. The east jetty would impound sediment, gradually building {{the width of the}} fragile beaches of Fire Island located to the east. Several sediment-sharing projects would benefit from the inlet relocation, a goal of regional sediment management. Potentially unacceptable negative consequences that require study, such as increased storm surge susceptibility, are identified...|$|E
5000|$|The {{comparatively}} {{large quantities}} of water that flow quite quickly through a gat cause heavy erosion that results in a channel deeper {{than the rest of}} the surrounding seabed and also endangers neighbouring islands. When the water masses from mud flats behind the islands surge out again into the sea as <b>ebb</b> <b>currents,</b> they flow rapidly again through the narrow gat. But as these water masses break out into the open sea, they spread out and slow down. As a result, on this seaward side of the gat, the particles of sand and mud carried with the water settle and form an ebb delta with its shallower waters between the islands. The sandbanks so formed are often known in Germany as plate (pronounced [...] "plah-ter", see Kachelotplate). The point where the water pouring out of the gat runs over these banks, which often lie in an arc between the islands, is the sand bar (Barre). This is the shallowest part of the gat for shipping, but also the deepest point on the shallowest line between the islands. A flood delta is formed in a similar way on the landward side of the gat.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLack of measurements {{has led to}} a poor understanding of tidal currents within the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR). Shipboard ADCP measurements are a technically viable means to measure these currents and their vertical structures. Shipboard ADCP measurements from a three-week long cruise conducted by the R/V Point Sur are used in this study. Transects along the main shipping channel and across the bar were extracted using criteria of constant speed and heading. Vertical sections from each transect were compared with predictions from the SELFE model in order to evaluate the models’ ability to predict these currents. Observed flood currents within the river are bottom intensified with slight river outflow at the surface early in the flood cycle. Complete reversal of the flow throughout the column is experienced later as the flood fully develops. <b>Ebb</b> <b>currents</b> are much stronger and more homogenous throughout the water column due to the combination of river outflow and tidal current. Inside the river mouth, the SELFE model agrees qualitatively well with observations, with only a few discrepancies. Outside the river mouth, the SELFE model does not resolve the observed vertical structure, possibly due to coarse grid resolution and limited observational input. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of environments and hydrodynamics in Cadiz Bay, it is of interest to study the dynamics of sedimentary exchange between the coastal zones and continental shelf. The most abundant clay minerals {{on the floor of}} the continental shelf and Cadiz Bay, and in the par-ticulate matter in suspension, are: illite, smectite, kaolinite + chlorite, and the interstratified clay minerals illite-smectite. The average concentration of suspended matter is 6. 5 mg/l, the lowest (1. 37 mg/l) being found on the inner shelf and in the inner zones of the bay less affected by cur-rents and surge. The highest values (14 mg/l) are found in the outer bay, consistent with the dis-tribution of muddy facies on the sea floor. The flow paths have been established from the local variations in the mineralogical associa-tions found at the sampling stations, and by means of the alignments of the lowest values of the factor loadings at those stations most affected by the flows. The mineralogical similarity of the components of the clay fraction is related to the mixing action undergone by the components of the suspended matter reaching the bay from various sources, probably produced by the contin-uous action of the tidal <b>ebb</b> <b>currents</b> flowing from the inner sectors of the bay towards the con...|$|R
