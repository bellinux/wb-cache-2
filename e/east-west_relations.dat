5|$|In <b>east–west</b> <b>relations,</b> Douglas-Home {{continued}} his policy {{of keeping the}} Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities of the KGB in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.|$|E

25|$|Berlin's unique {{situation}} {{as a city}} half-controlled by Western forces {{in the middle of}} the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany made it a natural focal point in the Cold War after 1947. Though the city was initially governed by a Four Power Allied Control Council with a leadership that rotated monthly, the Soviets withdrew from the council as <b>East-West</b> <b>relations</b> deteriorated and began governing their sector independently. The council continued to govern West Berlin, with the same rotating leadership policy, though now only involving France, Great Britain, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Zagreb drivers {{typically}} use a wide {{network of}} avenues and other arterial streets. Due {{to the shape}} of the city, most of the trips done in the city are on the <b>east-west</b> <b>relation,</b> causing high traffic on roads like Vukovar Avenue, Dubrovnik Avenue and Zagrebačka Avenue. The 18 km Slavonska Avenue is the longest {{and one of the most}} congested roads in Zagreb, connecting the inner city to the A3 highway in the east.|$|R
50|$|The {{branch line}} to Kelso from St Boswells opened on 17 June 1850 to a {{temporary}} station near Kelso; obstruction from the Duke of Roxburghe frustrated {{efforts to get}} a proper Kelso station at once, and the later permanent station was inconveniently located south of the Tweed. The Newcastle and Berwick Railway had earlier promoted a branch to Kelso from Tweedmouth, near Berwick, and Learmonth had envisaged these lines as together forming a strategic <b>east-west</b> link. <b>Relations</b> between the NBR and the North Eastern Railway, successor to the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, were cool and the development never took place.|$|R
50|$|For {{a period}} of almost thirty years (1927-1954) the school was funded {{predominantly}} through {{the support of the}} Rockefeller Foundation. Since then the Canton of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Council bear most of the costs associated with the Institute. This transfer of financial responsibility coincided with the 1955 arrival of William Rappard's successor as Director of the Institute, Lausanne historian Jacques Freymond. Freymond inaugurated {{a period of}} great expansion, increasing the range of subjects taught and the number of both students and faculty, a process that continued well after his retirement in 1978. Under Freymond's tenure, the Graduate Institute hosted many international colloquia that discussed preconditions for <b>east-west</b> negotiations, <b>relations</b> with China and its rising influence in world affairs, European integration, techniques and results of politico-socioeconomic forecasting (the famous early Club of Rome reports, and the Futuribles project led by Bertrand de Jouvenel), the causes and possible antidotes to terrorism, Pugwash Conference concerns and much more. Freymond's term also saw many landmark publications, including the Treatise on international law by Professor Paul Guggenheim and the six-volume compilation of historical documents relating to the Communist International.|$|R

500|$|Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for {{regional}} cooperation between NATO {{and its neighbors}} were set up, like the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1998, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. At that time, the decision was criticised in the US by many military, political and academic leaders as a [...] "a policy error of historic proportions." [...] According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and an advocate of the containment policy, this decision [...] "may {{be expected to have}} an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to <b>East-West</b> <b>relations,</b> [...] to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking." ...|$|E

40|$|Ever since Flinders Petrie {{undertook}} a theodolite survey on the Giza plateau in 1881 and {{drew attention to}} the extraordinary degree of precision with which the three colossal pyramids are oriented upon the four cardinal directions, there have been a great many suggestions as to how this was achieved and why it was of importance. Surprisingly, given the many astronomical hypotheses and speculations that have been offered in the intervening 130 years, there have been remarkably few attempts to reaffirm or improve on the basic survey data concerning the primary orientations. This paper presents the results of a week-long Total Station survey undertaken by the authors during December 2006 whose principal aim was to clarify the basic data concerning the orientation of each side of the three large pyramids and to determine, as accurately as possible, the orientations of as many as possible of the associated structures. The principal difference between this and all previous surveys is that it focuses upon measurements of sequences of points along multiple straight and relatively well preserved structural segments, with best-fit techniques being used to provide the best estimate of their orientation, as opposed to simple triangulation between directly identified or extrapolated corners. Our results suggest that there is only a very slight difference in orientation (c. 0. 5 arc minutes) between the north-south axes of Khufu's and Khafre's pyramids, that the sides of Khafre's are more perfectly perpendicular than those of Khufu's, and that the east-west axis is closer to true cardinality in both cases. The broader context of associated structures suggests that the <b>east-west</b> orientation in <b>relation</b> to sunrise or (in one case) sunset may have been a, or even the, key factor in many cases.
