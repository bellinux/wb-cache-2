He proposed that the declaration from the British government should state: [...] "its conviction, its desire or its intention to support Zionist aims {{for the creation of}} a Jewish national home in Palestine; no reference must be made <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> the question of the Suzerain Power because that would land the British into difficulties with the French; it must be a Zionist declaration." ...|$|E

500|$|Minogue's {{efforts to}} be taken seriously as a {{recording}} artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not [...] "paid her dues" [...] and {{was no more than a}} manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, [...] "If you're part of a record company, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Callin' In Sick" [...] is a style {{parody of}} music popular in Seattle, Washington, most notably grunge. [...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is a little bit harder <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Prost won {{the first}} two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost {{recovered}} from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that [...] "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> be honest, I had {{made the mistake of}} winning! The French don't really like winners." ...|$|E

500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia wants to be the best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> , simply because she just doesn't carry {{the weight of the world}} on her shoulders like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|E

It will help, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> be familiar with the novel, or to make a leap of sympathy with the characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{developing}} {{the character of}} Lexa further, the idea of her being romantically interested in women was pitched. [...] "It just made complete sense.

2500|$|Hitchens {{has said}} of his reputation: [...] "I {{know a lot of}} people {{consider}} me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth, but you have to learn not to care, or at least not to mind.

2500|$|Some of the {{controversy}} over this may be media driven.

2500|$|The {{term was}} popularized by {{sociologist}} and University of Pennsylvania professor E. Digby Baltzell, himself a WASP, in his 1964 book The Protestant Establishment: Aristocracy and Caste in America. Baltzell stressed the closed or caste-like {{characteristic of the}} group by arguing that [...] "There is a crisis in American leadership {{in the middle of}} the twentieth century that is partly due, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>to</b> the declining authority of an establishment which is now based on an increasingly castelike White-Anglo Saxon-Protestant (WASP) upper class." ...|$|E
