5|$|Sedna's <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> {{means that}} the {{probability}} of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.|$|E

25|$|Several planned {{thruster}} firings {{en route}} to Mercury were unnecessary, because these fine course adjustments were performed using solar radiation pressure acting on MESSENGER's solar panels.

25|$|Sirius' {{spacecraft}} Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 4 were {{manufactured by}} Space Systems/Loral. The first {{three of the}} series were orbited in 2000 by Proton-K Block-DM3 launch vehicles, with the final three-satellite constellation completed on November 30, 2000. Radiosat 4, built as a ground spare, {{was transferred to the}} Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in October 2012. It is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The satellites are based on the Space Systems/Loral 1300 platform. All three satellites broadcast directly to the consumer's receiver, but due to the <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> only two of them broadcast at any given time.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) make it very difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elliptical</b> {{geosynchronous}} <b>orbits</b> {{can be and}} {{are designed}} for communications satellites {{in order to keep}} the satellite within view of its assigned ground stations or receivers. A satellite in an <b>elliptical</b> geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> appears to oscillate in the sky from the viewpoint of a ground station, tracing an analemma in the sky. Satellites in <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> must be tracked by steerable ground stations.|$|R
40|$|The Atmosphere Explorer {{satellites}} (AE-C, -D, and -E) {{were initially}} placed into <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> with perigees around 140 km and apogees of 4000 km. As {{a result of}} such an orbital geometry, measurements of neutral constituents at high altitudes represent mainly vertical changes in densities. The influence of horizontal density gradients on measurements above 400 km is small. Under geomagnetically quiet conditions, the density profiles can be used to derive scale-height temperatures of the exosphere. The open-source neutral mass spectrometer (OSS) flown on all three AE-satellites measured neutral constituents such as N 2, O, and N well above 400 km. The temperatures derived from scale heights show a good agreement among the constituents and the expected close correlation with the F 10. 7 -cm solar flux. Satellites with <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> provide the opportunity to measure simultaneously both densities and temperatures...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the music}} {{services}} Muzak / DMX Music or Music Choice, the SiriusXM for Business service {{uses the same}} channels and SDARS delivery platform as the consumer Sirius service. The SDARS delivery platform, on the other hand, is more reliable {{than any of the}} other services in that it is not subject to satellite dish rain fade. The <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> of the Sirius satellite constellation can pose difficulties for the reliable delivery of the signal to stationary antennas in certain parts of the country. To eliminate this potential problem, Sirius launched a new geostationary satellite, FM-5, to improve service to non-mobile customers such as those of SiriusXM for Business. The service can also be accessed online using Sirius' online streaming technology, allowing any business with a broadband Internet connection to overcome any potential reception issues. Additionally, Sirius is applying for repeaters in Hawaii and Alaska and has already been granted authority for 20 repeaters covering the island of Puerto Rico by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|E

NGC 2419 is likely in a <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> around the Milky Way.

5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbits</b> formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.|$|R
500|$|Recent {{speculation}} about the alignment of extreme TNOs being due to a distant massive planet began with a 2014 letter to the journal Nature, in which astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott S.

Brown at Caltech explained how a massive outer planet would be the likeliest explanation for the similarities in orbits of six distant objects, and proposed specific orbital parameters. The predicted planet could be a super-Earth, with an estimated mass of 10 Earths (approximately 5,000 times the mass of Pluto), a diameter two to four times that of Earth, and a <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> with an orbital period of approximately 15,000 years.|$|E
500|$|... 90377 Sedna (520 AU average) is a large, reddish {{object with}} a gigantic, <b>highly</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>orbit</b> that takes it from about 76AU at {{perihelion}} to 940AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. Mike Brown, {{who discovered the}} object in 2003, asserts that it cannot {{be part of the}} scattered disc or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed [...] "distant detached objects" [...] (DDOs), which also may include the object , which has a perihelion of 45AU, an aphelion of 415AU, and an orbital period of 3,420 years. |work=University of Hawaii |url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~jewitt/kb/sedna.html|accessdate=23 June 2006}} Brown terms this population the [...] "inner Oort cloud" [...] because it may have formed through a similar process, although it is far closer to the Sun. Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though its shape has yet to be determined.

2500|$|The {{planet has}} a high {{eccentricity}} of about 0.63.
