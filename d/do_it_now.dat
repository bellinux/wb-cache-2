25|$|By 2000, Steve Jobs {{expressed}} interest in developing a portable music player. But Rubinstein demurred, saying the necessary components were not yet available. While on a routine supplier visit to Toshiba Corp. in February, 2001, however, Rubinstein first saw the tiny, 1.8-inch hard disk drive that became {{a critical component of}} the iPod. While Toshiba engineers had developed the drive, they were not sure how it could be used. At a Tokyo hotel later that evening, Rubinstein met with Jobs, who was in Japan on separate business. “I know how to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> All I need is a $10 million check,” he told Jobs.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E

The stream of editorials began with the July 20 article [...] "Somebody Is Getting Away With Murder", written by Seltzer himself. The following day, the Press published another front-page editorial, addressed directly to County Coroner Sam Gerber: [...] "Why No Inquest? <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> Dr. Gerber". A few hours after the editorial was published, Gerber ordered an inquest. And on July 30, the Press published an editorial entitled [...] "Quit Stalling – Bring Him In".

500|$|In {{his second}} year of college, Thompson {{embarked}} {{on a trip to}} San Juan, Puerto Rico as part of an exchange program. He spent six months in an apartment with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song [...] "Crackity Jones;" [...] many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view Halley's Comet (he later said it [...] "seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time"), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words [...] "we gotta <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>now</b> is the time Joe," [...] to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{was still}} {{interested}} in Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian in early 1991. Impressed with Daniel Waters' work on Heathers, Burton approached {{him for a}} rewrite. However, he eventually signed Waters to write the script for Batman Returns. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite. Warner Bros. approached Kevin Smith in 1996 to rewrite the script, though Smith turned down the offer in favor of Superman Lives. Smith later joked that his response was [...] "Didn't we say all we needed {{to say in the}} first Beetlejuice? Must we go tropical?" [...] In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying [...] "The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it." ...|$|E

He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>now</b> is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time."

2500|$|Orbison {{attributed}} his own passion {{during his}} performances {{to the period}} when {{he grew up in}} Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, [...] "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there.
