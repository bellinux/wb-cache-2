5000|$|... #Caption: The German <b>head</b> <b>yoke.</b> The German <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> {{was similar}} to the Acadian <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> in that both {{attached}} to the head at the horns. The alternative was the New England bow yoke that rested loosely on the necks of the oxen. These two Hereford oxen are about to be led in a summer parade.|$|E
50|$|Although {{all three}} yoke types are effective, {{each has its}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages. As mentioned above, withers yokes suit zebu cattle, and head yokes can of course only be used for animals with suitable horns. Head yokes need to be re-shaped frequently to fit the animals' horns as they grow; unlike other types, a single-beam <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> fixes {{the heads of the}} oxen apart, helping them to stand quietly without fighting. A single-beam <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> may offer better braking ability on downhill grades and appears to be preferred in rugged mountainous areas such as Switzerland, Spain and parts of Italy. Bow yokes need to be the correct size for the animal, and new ones are often made as the animal grows, but they need no adjustment in use. Whichever type is used, various lengths of yoke may be required for different agricultural implements or to adjust to different crop-row spacings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>yokes</b> {{are widely}} used in {{southern}} Europe, much of South America and in Canada.|$|R
50|$|In other circumstances, {{horned animals}} may be preferred, for example, {{to help the}} animal defend itself against predators, to allow the {{attachment}} of <b>head</b> <b>yokes</b> to draught oxen, to provide a hand-hold on smaller animals such as sheep, or for aesthetic reasons - in some breeds the retention of horns is required for showing.|$|R

50|$|A <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> fits {{onto the}} head of the oxen. It usually fits behind the horns, and has carved-out {{sections}} into which the horns fit; it may be a single beam attached to both oxen, or each ox may have a separate short beam (see picture). The yoke is then strapped to the horns of the oxen with yoke straps. Some types fit instead onto the front of the head, again strapped to the horns, and ox pads are then used for cushioning the forehead of the ox. A tug pole is held {{to the bottom of the}} yoke using yoke irons and chains. The tug pole can either be a short pole with a chain attached for hauling, or a long pole with a hook on the end that has no chain at all. Sometimes the pole is attached to a wagon and the oxen are simply backed over this pole, the pole is then raised between them and a backing bolt is dropped into the chains on the yoke irons in order to haul the wagon.|$|E
40|$|Three yoking {{systems are}} used {{globally}} {{to capture the}} power of oxen. These are the <b>head</b> <b>yoke,</b> withers yoke, and neck yoke. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, with culture and cattle {{playing a role in}} the adoption and use of each system. The neck yoke system offers important lessons in understanding animal comfort and yoke design. Despite its success, the neck yoke should not be universally adopted, nor should it be universally promoted. However ignoring the lessons learned in North America over the last 400 years would ignore animals and teamsters who perfected this system and learned to maximize animal comfort and performance. Using history, research in Africa, as well as farm and competition experience from the United States and Canada, this paper addresses improving animal comfort, performance and welfare by understanding and appreciating yoking systems for oxen.

50|$|A yoke may be {{used with}} a single animal. Oxen are {{normally}} worked in pairs, but water buffalo in Asian countries are commonly used singly, {{with the aid of}} a bow-shaped withers yoke. Use of single bow or withers yokes on oxen is documented from North America, China, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Switzerland, and several designs of single <b>head</b> or forehead <b>yoke</b> are recorded in Germany.|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, three {{dimensional}} dynamic micromagnetic modeling {{based on}} Landau-Lifshitz equation with Gilbert damping {{has been used}} to study the magnetic processes of the thin film write heads for high density and high data rate perpendicular magnetic recording. In extremely narrow track width regime, for example, around or below 100 nm, the head field is found to suffer from significant loss from the ideal AttM s value for perpendicular recording. In the meantime, remanent head field becomes significant, posing potential issue of head remanence erasure. Using micromagnetic modeling, various novel head designs have been investigated. For an overall head dimension around one micron, the shape and structure of the <b>head</b> <b>yoke</b> have been found to greatly affect the head magnetization reversal performance, therefore the field rise time, especially for moderate driving currents. A lamination of the head across its thickness, both in the yoke and in the pole tip, yields excellent field reversal speed, and more importantly, it suppresses the remanent field very well and thus making itself a simple and effective approach to robust near-zero remanence. A single pole head design with a stitched pole tip and a recessed side yoke can produce significantly enhanced head field compared to a traditional single pole head. Various head design parameters have been examined via micromagnetic modeling. Using the dynamic micromagnetic model, the magnetization reversal processes at data rates beyond 1 G bit/s have been studied. The excitation of spin wave during the head field reversal and the energy dissipation afterwards were found im portant in dictating the field rise time. Both the drive current rise time and the Gilbert damping constant affect the field reversal speed. The effect of the soft underlayer (SUL) in both the write and the read processes have been studied via micromagnetic modeling. Although it is relatively easy to fulfill the requirement for the magnetic imaging in writing, the SUL deteriorates the readback performance and lowers the achievable recording linear density. Various parameters have been investigated and solutions have been proposed. The effect of stress in magnetostrictive thin films has been studied both analytically and by simulation. The micromagnetic model has been extended to incorporate the stress-induced anisotropy effect. Simulation was done on both a magnetic thin film undergoing stresses to show the static domains and a conceptual write head design that utilizes the stress induced anisotropy to achieve better performance. A self-consistent model based on energy minimization has been developed to model both the magnetization and the stress-strain states of a magnetic thin film...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the past}} the {{principal}} use of the crush, in England {{also known as a}} trevis, was for the shoeing of oxen. Crushes were, and in places still are, used for this purpose in North America and in many European countries. They were usually stand-alone constructions of heavy timbers or stone columns and beams. Some were simple, without a <b>head</b> bail or <b>yoke,</b> while others had more sophisticated restraints and mechanisms; a common feature is a belly sling which allows the animal to be partly or wholly raised from the ground. In Spain, the crush was a village community resource and is called potro de herrar, or [...] "shoeing frame". In France it is called travail à ferrer (plural travails, not travaux) or [...] "shoeing trevis", and was associated with blacksmith shops. Although the word travail derives from Latin tripalium, [...] "three beams", all surviving examples but that at Roissard have four columns. In central Italy it is called a travaglio, but in Sardinia is referred to as sa macchina po ferrai is boisi, or [...] "the machine for shoeing the oxen". In the United States it was called an ox sling, an ox press or shoeing stalls. In some countries, including the Netherlands and France, horses were commonly shod in the same structures. In the United States similar but smaller structures, usually called horse shoeing stocks, are still in use, primarily to assist farriers in supporting the weight of the horse's hoof and leg when shoeing draft horses.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the American Institute of Physics via the DOI in this record. Four {{different}} designs of partially built hard disk write <b>heads</b> with a <b>yoke</b> comprising four repeats of NiFe (1 nm) /CoFe (50 nm) were studied by both x-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM). These techniques were used to investigate the static equilibrium domain configuration and the magnetodynamic response across the entire structure, respectively. Simulations and previous TRSKM studies have made proposals for the equilibrium domain configuration of similar structures, but no direct observation of the equilibrium state of the writers has yet been made. In this study, static XPEEM images of the equilibrium state of writer structures were acquired using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism as the contrast mechanism. These images suggest that the crystalline anisotropy dominates the equilibrium state domain configuration, but competition with shape anisotropy ultimately determines the stability of the equilibrium state. Dynamic TRSKM images were acquired from nominally identical devices. These images suggest that a longer confluence region may hinder flux conduction from the yoke into the pole tip: the shorter confluence region exhibits clear flux beaming along the symmetry axis, whereas the longer confluence region causes flux to conduct along one edge of the writer. The observed variations in dynamic response agree well with the differences in the equilibrium magnetization configuration visible in the XPEEM images, confirming that minor variations in the geometric design of the writer structure can have significant effects on the process of flux beaming.
