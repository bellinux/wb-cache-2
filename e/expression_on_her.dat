25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays {{the idea that she}} is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face is also denoted with an air of approachability according.|$|E
25|$|Tomoki Nagamine {{attempts}} to confess his love to an upperclassman named Sayuki Ayase; however, {{he does not}} succeed in doing so, being caught off by a sad <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. In the meantime, he works alongside his crush Sayuki in the library committee. One day, the library manager Misuzu gives Tomoki a diary, telling him that the book chose him. A cute girl introducing herself as Yua—who is the goddess of happiness—comes bursting out of the book, and informs Tomoki that all his happiest memories will be recorded in his diary. The story mostly revolves around Tomoki interacting with the four heroines (in later versions, seven) and eventually forming a romantic relationship with one.|$|E
25|$|The series' main {{theme is}} {{responsibility}} {{as seen through}} Kenshin's action as he wants to atone {{for all the people}} he killed during the Bakumatsu by aiding innocent people by wielding a non-lethal sword. Marco Olivier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolizes Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors appearing in the series. This theme also encourages former drug dealer Takani Megumi into becoming a doctor upon learning of Kenshin's past and actions. Another theme is power which is mostly seen by Sagara Sanosuke and Myojin Yahiko. However, like Megumi, these two characters are also influenced by the main character as they wish to become stronger in order to assist Kenshin across the plot. Additionally, the series discourages revenge as seen in the final arc when Yukishiro Enishi believes he succeeded in getting his revenge on Kenshin but starts having hallucinations of his late sister with a sad <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the child}} grew silent and {{thoughtful}} again. Mary Louise, watching the changing <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, was convinced she knew {{more of the}} mystery than she dared confide to her new friend. There was no use trying to force her confidence, however; in her childish way she was both shrewd and stubborn and any such attempt would be doomed to failure. But after quite a period of silence Mary Louise asked gently: ...|$|R

25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

[...] The Times recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the [...] "endless layers of mysteries" [...] the image offers: [...] "What is Norman Mailer's head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or F-16s skimming the hills?" ...|$|E

Yuen Qiu, who did not audition, was spotted during her friend's screen test smoking a {{cigarette}} with a sarcastic <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, which won her the part. Qiu, a student of Yu Jim-yuen, sifu of the China Drama Academy, had appeared in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun at the age of 18. [...] After a number of other small roles, she retired from films in the 1980s. [...] Kung Fu Hustle was her first role in nineteen years.

500|$|Describing Dot, Brown has said, [...] "I love playing her– she's {{a strong}} character. Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd {{religious}} beliefs, but her heart's {{in the right}} place. She has that awful worried <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face the whole time". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has [...] "no reason to have the hypochondria she {{had in the past}} [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state– I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is".|$|E

2500|$|A 1934 New Yorker article {{reported}} that at her execution she wore [...] "a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially {{made for the}} occasion, {{and a pair of}} new white gloves" [...] though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, [...] "Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, her head up always, and without the slightest change of <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her." [...] A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, pulled out his revolver, and shot her in the head to make sure she was dead.|$|E
60|$|Before {{speaking}} {{he looked}} at her with a great new interest in his eye. It {{was the first time that}} he had seen her thus, and she was altered in more than dress.

2500|$|According to Anna Marie West, {{both she}} and Charmaine were {{frequently}} subjected to criticism, beatings, {{and other forms of}} punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose's care at Midland Road, but although she (Anna Marie) was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in relation to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was beaten or to what punishment she was subjected. Despite the years of neglect and abuse she had endured, Charmaine's spirit had not been broken, and she would talk wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held her [...] "mummy will come and save me". Anna Marie would later recollect her sister would repeatedly antagonise Rose by making statements such as: [...] "My real mummy wouldn't swear or shout at us" [...] in response to Rose's scathing profanities. A childhood friend of Charmaine's who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road named Tracey Giles would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests' flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Tracey, Charmaine had been [...] "calm and unconcerned", whereas Anna Marie had been standing by the door with a blank <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E

60|$|Judy {{never owned}} a doll, {{never heard of}} Cinderella, never played at any game. She once or twice fell into {{children}}'s company {{when she was about}} ten years old, but the children couldn't get on with Judy, and Judy couldn't get on with them. She seemed like an animal of another species, and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides. It is very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh. She has so rarely seen the thing done that the probabilities are strong the other way. Of anything like a youthful laugh, she certainly can have no conception. If she were to try one, she would find her teeth in her way, modelling that action of her face, as she has unconsciously modelled all its other <b>expressions,</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> pattern of sordid age. Such is Judy.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, it was Pomona.

She listened attentively, with the constrained <b>expression</b> still <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, and her hands still nervously clasped together in her lap.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} single case study of a brain-damaged patient, AD, {{suffering}} from visual face and object agnosia, with impaired visual perception and preserved mental imagery. She is severely impaired {{in all aspects of}} overt recognition of faces as well as in covert recognition of familiar faces. She shows a complete loss of pro-cessing facial expressions in recognition as well as in matching tasks. Nevertheless, when presented with a task where face and voice expressions were presented concur-rently, there was a clear impact of face <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ratings of the voice. The cross-modal paradigm used here and validated previously with normal subjects (de Gelder & Vroomen, 1995, 2000), appears as a useful tool in investigating spared covert face processing in a neuropsychological perspective, especially with proso-pagnosic patients. These findings are discussed against the background of different models of the covert recognition of face expressions. ª 2000 Academic Press Key Words: cross-modal bias; affective cognition; face expression; voice expres-sion; emotions; prosopagnosia; covert recognition; implicit processing; conscious-ness...|$|R
