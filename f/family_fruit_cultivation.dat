40|$|While Hampton Court Palace was {{occupied}} by the royal <b>family,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>cultivation</b> formed {{an integral part of}} horticulture. This paper reveals that it was not only integral to the gardens but also had an important symbolic function. The collection of fruit at Hampton Court was a leading reference collection, new trends were set here, new varieties were cultivated and new techniques of cultivation were developed. While it was generally recognized as such, it was compromised during a reorganisation of the functions of the gardens of the various royal palaces around London in 1842. Until then, fruit culture at Hampton Court was justly celebrated, and this case study investigates for the first time how over a three-hundred-year period societal change affected and shaped new fashions of consumption and cultivation. As such this paper alters our thinking about the role fruit had within society and how it was an indicator of social and political change...|$|E

A social survey assessed current <b>fruit</b> <b>cultivation</b> and the <b>fruit</b> planting preferences of farmers, as well as differences in preferences based on distance to roads. Survey results from 200 households in 21 villages indicate current <b>fruit</b> <b>cultivation</b> does not correspond well with planting preferences. Households near and far from roads share similar cultivation patterns and planting preferences with one exception: farmers living far from roads prefer to plant coffee significantly more than do those living near roads. I attribute this preference for coffee cultivation far from roads to coffee’s high sales price and relative ease of transport to buyers. This study produced a rank-ordered list of fruit preferences to guide nursery priorities across the study area, though nursery managers are encouraged to focus on coffee for remote planting projects...|$|R
