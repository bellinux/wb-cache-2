25|$|In his introduction, Mailer details his {{conflicted}} {{attitude toward}} the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one. This claim, however, might just be a way for Mailer to mitigate any negative criticism and show modesty by denying his abilities, or as a ruse to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> to discover for ourselves whether Mailer can write a good short story.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E

25|$|Dave Gaubatz, {{a former}} Air Force special {{investigator}} {{who was as}} a civilian employee in Iraq in 2003, says that while in Iraq, he acquired what he considered reliable information about WMD caches in four locations that had gas and chemical weapons that were recently produced. He could not <b>get</b> <b>U.S.</b> military officials {{to look into the}} matter, so he eventually contacted Weldon and Representative Peter Hoekstra, head of the House Intelligence Committee, to share his information and to try to get them to pressure the Defense Department and intelligence agencies to do the WMD searches in four locales.|$|E
25|$|If the {{immediate}} international situation {{is used as}} an excuse to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> to drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, {{and at the end of}} it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} episode aired during the {{beginning}} of the fifth season, it was produced by the crew of the fourth season. A large part of the original crew left the show after season four. This led to the addition of several scenes, which normally would not have been considered, because the mentality of the departing crew was [...] "what are they going to do, <b>get</b> <b>us</b> fired?" [...] Although most of the episode was completed by the staff of season four, the end was rewritten by the team of season five.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Roth Cornet {{wrote that}} [...] "though it's {{unlikely}} {{to stand out}} {{as one of the}} shrewdest political satires of its time, [...] is a clever, unrestrained and—most importantly—sidesplitting parody that pokes fun at both a vapid media and one of the world's most dangerous dictators." [...] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net said the film was [...] "hilarious, but it will probably <b>get</b> <b>us</b> nuked." [...] Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that [...] "if this unessential but agreeable movie really triggered an international response, this is life reflecting art in a major way." ...|$|E

500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E
500|$|The duo reprised their {{performance}} at KIIS-FM's Wango Tango music festival in Los Angeles, on May 14, 2011. Lopez wore a shiny gold catsuite for the performance, {{which did not}} go as planned when halfway through the performance her microphone failed. She continued performing for 20 seconds, before realising that she had lost sound. According to lifestyle website Female First, Lopez proceeded to dance, and urged the audience to sing along. At {{the end of the}} performance, Lopez addressed the crowd straight after the performance, saying [...] "We ain't gonna let that <b>get</b> <b>us</b> down, right? Nobody keeps mama down."

[...] "We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there’s an {{enormous}} economic incentive to shoot there.

It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E

500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "The animation is stunningly rendered. But {{the story is}} always the critical element in Pixar movies, and Cars' story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Like the Toy Story films, Cars is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, {{with a dash of}} Zen by way of George Lucas." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might <b>get</b> <b>us</b> into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't <b>get</b> <b>us</b> into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E

500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> killed." ...|$|E

It was a great idea to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> out of Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment."
