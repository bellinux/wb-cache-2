That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility.

25|$|Unlike dynamic {{metabolic}} simulation, FBA {{assumes that}} the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, {{it is possible that}} an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that they are far less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the need to consider enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.|$|E

2500|$|Theories abound for the {{different}} possible causes of the flagrant graft that exists in Nigeria. Some blame greed and ostentatious lifestyles as a potential root cause of corruption. To some, societies in love with ostentatious lifestyle may delve into corrupt practices to feed the lifestyle and also embrace a style of public sleaze and lack of decorum. The customs and attitudes of the society {{may also be a}} contributing factor. Gift giving as expressions of loyalty or tributes to traditional rulers may be fabrics of the society.

These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008.Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action.Environment destruction caused by humans is a global problem, and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is on going every day.
