This paper describes ve properties of probabilistic <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> that are particularly useful in intelligent systems research. (1) Directed probabilistic graphs capture essential qualitative properties of a domain, along with its causal structure. (2) Concepts such as relevance and con icting evidence have a natural, formally sound meaning in probabilistic models. (3) Probabilistic schemes support sound reasoning at a variety of levels ranging from purely quantitative to purely qualitative levels. (4) The role of probability theory in reasoning under uncertainty can be compared to the role of rst order logic in reasoning under certainty. Probabilistic <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> provide insight into the foundations of logic-based schemes, showing their diculties in highly uncertain domains. Finally, (5) probabilistic <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> support automatic generation of understandable explanations of inference for the sake of user interfaces to intelligent systems. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{epistemological}} foundations of <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> embodied in retrieval languages. It considers questions such as the validity of <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> and their effectiveness {{for the purposes of}} retrieval and automation. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> it considers are derived from three theories of meaning that have dominated twentieth-century philosophy. The discipline of philosophy impacts other knowledge disciplines, particularly in the theoretical constructs they employ. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore how epistemology, that branch of philosophy concerned with how and what we know, has contributed to the design of <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> embodied in retrieval languages designed for organizing information. Different retrieval languages make different presuppositions about what is meant by knowledge. These differences give rise to questions such as • How valid are the <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> embodied in different retrieval languages, i. e., how well do they do what they purport to do, i. e., to represent knowledge? • How effective are they in facilitating the achievement of the objectives of a retrieval language: collocation, discrimination, and navigation? • How amenable are they to automation and semantic interoperability? In the course of the twentieth century, the problem of what and how we know has been dealt with through language analysis and theories of meaning. Three theories of meaning are especially relevant to the discussion o...|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{question}} facing cognitive science concerns {{the nature of}} conceptual representations {{as well as the}} constraints on the interactions between them. One specific question we address in this paper is what makes cross representational interplay possible? We offer two distinct theoretical scenarios: According to the first scenario, co-activated <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> interact {{with the help of an}} interface established between them via congruent activation in a mediating third party general cognitive mechanism, e. g., attention. According to the second scenario, co-activated <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> interact due to an overlap between their features, for example when they share a magnitude component. First, we make a case for cross-representational interplay based on grounded and situated theories of cognition. Second, we discuss interface-based interactions between distinct (i. e., non-overlapping) <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations.</b> Third, we discuss how co-activated representations may share their architecture via partial overlap. Finally, we outline constraints regarding the flexibility of these proposed mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Semantic {{matching}} {{is finding}} a mapping between two <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> encoded using the same ontology. Solving this matching problem is hard because the syntactic form of two <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations</b> rarely matches exactly. Previous research has shown transformation rules {{can be used to}} improve matching, but acquiring transformations is difficult. In this paper, we present an algorithm for mining transformation rules for semantic matching. This algorithm was evaluated in two domains – battle space planning and chemistry. In both cases, the resulting transformations helped to improve matching significantly compared to using only taxonomic knowledge. ...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} {{has emerged as}} a growing field of practice and research in response to the recognition that knowledge is a potent force in the economy, and for competitive advantage. The concept of knowledge itself, however, remains vague and unsatisfactory, a situation that may well hinder the development of knowledge management theory and practice. Several perspectives on knowledge are outlined in this paper, including empiricist, rationalist, autopoietic, connectionist, and situated cognitivist. The latter perspective in particular is discussed in detail, as it provides the useful conceptual distinction between knowing-in-action as a transactional process, and <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations.</b> The implications for these perspectives for knowledge management practice are discussed. It is concluded that on any definition of knowledge, the management of people in its broadest sense must be a central feature. From the perspective of situated cognition it is argued that knowledge management practice in fact focuses on management of <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> itself cannot be managed, only the conditions of its use-in-action, which necessarily centres on people. Knowledge management practice, if it is to remain distinct from information management, which also focused on <b>knowledge</b> <b>representations,</b> must give pride of place to the management of people. 1...|$|R
