5|$|Nouvelles Extraordinaires, {{like other}} {{newspapers}} of its time, gave primarily political and commercial information, classified by source and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (the oldest, {{from the most}} distant lands, coming first). It offered reports on international politics, such as wars and diplomatic relations, as well as coverage of major domestic affairs. The newspaper also contained trivia, editorials and advertising.

5|$|The Allies had {{detected}} {{preparations for}} the convoy, and naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C., had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy’s intended destination and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The Allied Air Forces had developed new techniques they hoped would improve the chances of successful air attack on ships. They detected and shadowed the convoy, which came under sustained air attack on 2–3 March 1943. Follow-up attacks by PT boats and aircraft were made on 4 March. All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship, greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows.

500|$|Thirteen {{years after}} the trial, in a memoir {{entitled}} Master of the Girl Pat published by Doubleday, George Orsborne provided a new context for the Girl Pat voyage. According to this narrative, he had been recruited in 1935 to work for British Naval Intelligence. The Girl Pat venture was a secret assignment, connected with the imminent Spanish Civil War. Between the stops at Corcubión and Dakar, Orsborne claims, he carried out a mission {{to blow up a}} railway bridge in Spanish Morocco. The stops at Port Etienne, Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence. In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details: Stone becomes [...] "Fletcher", and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a [...] "desertion". Some of Orsborne's dates are inconsistent with the boat's known movements—he gives 26 June as the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> in Dakar, and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record. Orsborne describes his stay in Wormwood Scrubs prison as [...] "a wonderful experience. I wouldn't have missed it for anything".|$|E
