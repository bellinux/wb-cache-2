50|$|The 26th OWS Systems Flight is {{responsible}} for maintaining and upgrading all computer systems equipment locally owned and employed by the 26th Operational Weather Squadron. The Systems Flight consists of a Government Civilian personnel as well as Active Duty USAF Airmen with an AFSC of 3D0X2 (Cyber Systems Operator). The job for both GS and USAF personnel generally consists of standard network administrative tasks, i.e., system building, installation, integration, internetworking, <b>intranetworking,</b> and vulnerability assessment. The Systems Flight also functions as a communications focal point, performing small computer maintenance and ensuring the availability of computer services to {{the remainder of the}} squadron.|$|E

Our efforts cover three critical areas of scalable, parallel I/O for for highperformance multicomputers: networking, memory management, and file and object store. We are leveraging off on-going research results in these three areas. Our main efforts in the scalable I/O initiative will be directed towards hardening, porting, tuning, and deploying our technology on the target platforms. 1 Introduction This document describes {{the operating system}} component in the Scalable I/O Initiative for high-performance multicomputers. The operating system component offers coverage over three critical requirements for message-based massively parallel multicomputers: Networking : Support low-overhead, high-bandwidth, and scalable communication between processors. This will involve work at two different levels. The first, <b>intranetworking,</b> enables communication between processors {{that are part of}} the sa [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Scandinavian {{countries}} are all among the {{minority of the}} world's nations that have established a national health network infrastructure. These networks provide a secured communication environment for health professionals, mainly in hospitals and local health services/GPs. Despite serving similar requirements, these national infrastructures differ in several aspects: organizational extension, choice of carrier technology, IP addressing and NAT strategy, DNS implementation and QoS support. Initiatives to interconnect these national health networks in Scandinavia date several years back, and today the Danish health network {{has a number of}} cross-border connections, including VPN tunnels to the Swedish and Norwegian health networks. However, limitations in the connecting technology, and scalability issues related to technological architecture, pose limitations on the cross-border service provisioning. The thesis investigates the differences in technical infrastructure, discusses consequences of these differences, and suggests modifications to harmonize the technology among the national health networks involved. Some of these suggestions may even have merit within national borders, as they can be seen to address scaling issues in <b>intranetworking</b> in general...|$|E
40|$|Since 2000, the {{convergence}} of new low-cost fast <b>intranetworking</b> technology and very large storage components has enabled completely new solutions to conservation of, and widespread accessibility to, cultural media. In a project commencing during mid 2002, ZKM has investigated the mid- and long-term implications of these technologies in the context both of archival and conservation and also of access by researchers and the public. This work has centered upon the construction and management of very large disk storage systems by non-specialist personnel in the museum environment, and builds upon ZKMs experience with largescale automated CD archives. While the advantages of disk-based storage for media archive is well reported, this project addresses the reliability of such systems for repository of high quality masters, enabling the complete disposal of conventional tape media for the first time. The ZKM Storage Area Network (SAN) project will reach approximately 100 Tb (Terabyte) capacity by mid 2004 and will eventually house the audio and moving imagery collection of the ZKM | Media Library as well as mirroring several other collections. This paper presents specific experiences in loss-less digitisation processes and the automatic generation from digital masters {{of a range of}} outdated, current, and future compressed data formats for internet and mobile wireless users. The interoperability of different vendor storage products and open systems-based implementations is reported and the personnel training and management procedures necessary to sustain and guarantee the integrity of such archives over very long periods is also addressed...|$|E
