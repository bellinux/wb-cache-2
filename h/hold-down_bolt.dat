50|$|When the two NSDs were ignited at each hold down, the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolt</b> {{traveled}} downward {{because of}} the release of tension in the bolt (pretensioned before launch), NSD gas pressure and gravity. The bolt was stopped by the stud deceleration stand, which contained sand. The SRB bolt was 28 in long and 3.5 in in diameter. The frangible nut was captured in a blast container.|$|E
50|$|Timing {{sequence}} referencing in ignition {{is critical}} for a successful liftoff and ascent flight. The explosive <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> relieve (through the launch support pedestals and pad structure) the asymmetric vehicle dynamic loads caused by the SSME ignition and thrust buildup, and applied thrust bearing loads. Without the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> the SSMEs would violently tip the flight stack (orbiter, external tank, SRBs) over onto the external tank. That rotating moment is initially countered by the hold-bolts. Prior to release of the vehicle stack for liftoff, the SRBs must simultaneously ignite and pressurize their combustion chambers and exhaust nozzles to produce a thrust derived, net counter-rotating moment exactly equal to the SSMEâ€™s rotating moment. With the SRBs reaching full thrust, the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> are blown, releasing the vehicle stack, the net rotating moment is zero, and the net vehicle thrust (opposing gravity) is positive, lifting the orbiter stack vertically from the launch pedestal, controllable through the coordinated gimbal movements of the SSMEs and the SRB exhaust nozzles.|$|R
50|$|The piers had not shifted or settled, but the masonry of {{the pier}} bases showed poor {{adhesion}} between stone and cement: the stone had been left too smooth, and had not been wetted before adding the cement. The <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> to which the column bases were fastened were poorly designed, and they burst through the masonry too easily.|$|R
40|$|In December 1996, the Boiling Water Reactor Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP) issued BWRVIP- 25 [1], which {{provides}} a generic inspection strategy for boiling water reactor (BWR) core plates, and defines flaw evaluation methodologies. That report provides inspection/repair strategies for the core plate rim <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> that include installation of wedges, or periodic ultrasonic (UT) and/or visual (VT) examination. Carolina Power & Light Company (CP&L) has developed a plant specific inspection plan for the core plate rim holddown bolts. The plan is considered equivalent to the inspection requirements described in the generic guidelines provided in BWRVIP- 25, but is more detailed and avoids the need for wedge installation by combining rigorous analyses with UT and/or VT examination. This paper presents {{a description of the}} alternate inspection plan, a discussion of the qualification requirements, and a summary of the analyses performed for the core plate rim <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> for th [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Each {{solid rocket}} booster had four {{hold-down}} posts that fit into corresponding support posts on the mobile launcher platform. <b>Hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> held the SRB and launcher platform posts together. Each bolt had a nut at each end, {{the top one}} being a frangible nut. The top nut contained two NASA standard detonators (NSDs), which were ignited at solid rocket motor ignition commands.|$|R
50|$|The Space Shuttle {{main engines}} (SSMEs) were ignited at T-6.6 seconds. The SSMEs were liquid-fueled {{and could be}} safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the Solid Rocket Boosters ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> were {{released}} with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad. At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to 104% under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the External Tank (ET) but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident. The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.|$|R

40|$|Public Power District was {{not able}} to fully inspect 50 % of the core plate rim <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> at Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) in {{accordance}} with BWRVIP- 25 (Reference). BWRVIP- 25 requires that 50 % of the core plate rim <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> of BWR/ 2 - 5 plants without repair wedges be examined by enhanced VT- 1 from below the core plate (or by UT from above core plate once the technique is developed). However, it was determined that the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification demonstrates that the core plate bolts have a relatively low susceptibility to cracking based on field experience and fabrication practices. In addition, should cracking occur in some bolts, the consequences are mitigated by redundancy in the bolting and associated alignment hardware.

However, {{it was determined that}} the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification included an analysis that found that the bolting has a relatively low susceptibility to cracking and a very high flaw tolerance. Therefore, postulated flaws would not grow to a size that significantly reduces the bolt preload {{over the life of the}} plant. Even if significant cracking did occur in the bolting, redundant structural components will prevent adverse displacement of the core plate. Furthermore, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control (SLC) system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown. The BWRVIP is currently working on developing revised guidance for the Core Plate bolts and expects to complete that work, including gaining NRC approval of the revised guidance, by the end of 2015. Given the low likelihood that the function of the core plate will be compromised by bolting failures, there is little risk in postponing inspections of the bolts until such time as the BWRVIP develops revised guidance. This letter is being transmitted for information only and PSEG Nuclear is not requesting any action from the NRC staff. A-oo...|$|R
40|$|Until Solid Rocket Motor ignition, the Space Shuttle is mated to the Mobil Launch Platform in part via eight (8) Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts.</b> The bolts are {{fractured}} using redundant pyrotechnics, and {{are designed}} to drop through a hold-down post on the Mobile Launch Platform before the Space Shuttle begins movement. The Space Shuttle program has experienced numerous failures where a bolt has "hung-up. " That is, it did not clear the hold-down post before liftoff and was caught by the SRBs. This places an additional structural load on the vehicle that {{was not included in}} the original certification requirements. The Space Shuttle is currently being certified to withstand the loads induced by up to three (3) of eight (8) SRB hold-down post studs experiencing a "hang-up. " The results af loads analyses performed for four (4) stud-hang ups indicate that the internal vehicle loads exceed current structural certification limits at several locations. To determine the risk to the vehicle from four (4) stud hang-ups, the likelihood of the scenario occurring must first be evaluated. Prior to the analysis discussed in this paper, the likelihood of occurrence had been estimated assuming that the stud hang-ups were completely independent events. That is, it was assumed that no common causes or factors existed between the individual stud hang-up events. A review of the data associated with the hang-up events, showed that a common factor (timing skew) was present. This paper summarizes a revised likelihood evaluation performed for the four (4) stud hang-ups case considering that there are common factors associated with the stud hang-ups. The results show that explicitly (i. e. not using standard common cause methodologies such as beta factor or Multiple Greek Letter modeling) taking into account the common factor of timing skew results in an increase in the estimated likelihood of four (4) stud hang-ups of an order of magnitude over the independent failure case...|$|R
50|$|On December 12, {{the second}} attempt {{to launch a}} {{complete}} Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. Their relief at having avoided certain disaster on December 12 was short-lived when the Titan exploded {{almost as soon as}} it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off, as Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile. Testing confirmed that the shock from the pad <b>hold-down</b> <b>bolts</b> firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months. On February 2, 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on February 24, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8 due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting. On July 1, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrievedâ€”it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.|$|R
40|$|Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) {{structures}} are assembled with massive timber panels that are fastened {{together and to}} the horizontal elements (the foundations and the intermediate floors) with step joints and mechanical connections. Due to the high in-plane stiffness of CLT, the seismic behaviour of those structures markedly depends upon the connections used. The mechanical behaviour of lateral load-resisting systems made with CLT panels and typical connection systems {{was the focus of}} a large body of research, especially in Europe and North America. Furthermore, full-scale shaking table tests were carried out on several multi-storey buildings, demonstrating a significant ductility and energy dissipation under seismic loading. In contrast with the significant findings associated to those research projects, specific calculation methods have not yet been included either in Eurocode 5 (static design) or in Eurocode 8 (seismic design). Nowadays, the design is done using simplified calculation methods that neglect the connections stiffness and introduce some simplifications on their mechanical behaviour. The mechanical characterization of typical connection systems for CLT structures (e. g. with angle brackets and <b>hold-downs,</b> nailed and <b>bolted</b> to the wall and floor panels) is an expensive and time-consuming process, since requires the execution {{of a large number of}} tests. Therefore, to limit the need of experimental testing to a minimum, significant effort should be devoted to develop advanced numerical models capable to predict their load-displacement response and failure mechanisms. In the scope of this thesis, an extensive experimental programme was carried out on nailed steel-to-timber joints in CLT. The experimental results were used as input to assess the reliability of currently available calculation methods and to develop capacity-based design principles for nailed steel-to-timber joints in CLT (i. e. the overstrength factor and the strength degradation factor). In addition, analytical methods and numerical models capable to predict the mechanical properties and energy dissipation at different building levels (single fastener joint, connection, and wall system) were developed. Experimental results obtained during previous research projects served also for calibration of non-linear analyses, which were used to extend the test results to different configurations of technical interest. Outcomes of the parametric studies provided better understanding of the seismic behaviour and energy dissipation of typical connection systems for CLT buildings. It was concluded that the numerical models presented within this thesis are a sound basis to investigate the seismic behaviour of CLT buildings. However, future research is required to further verify and improve these predictive models...|$|R
