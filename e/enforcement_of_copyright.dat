25|$|There is an {{argument}} that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state. That is, infringing on copyright, unlike theft, does not deprive {{the victim of the}} original item, and so <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> law constitutes aggression {{on the part of the}} state.|$|E

25|$|For African artists concerts {{were the}} one of the fews ways to earn in the industry. Piracy and {{changing}} consumer behavior are behind declining sales of records. <b>Enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> law remains weak in Africa. MusikBi is the first legal music download website of Africa. It does not offer streaming and is limited by internet speeds in Africa. African countries (Kenya, Gambia and South Africa) have seen protest over airtime given to American music. In Zimbabwe 75% of airtime has to be given to local music. Protective actions have seen the growth of new genres like Urban Grooves emerge in Zimbabwe. In 2016 Sony Music launched in Africa by opening an office in Nigeria, traditionally services of western major international studios have not been available in Africa, the local demand for their music being met through piracy.|$|E

500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> {{has less to do with}} money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Despite his popularity, {{the artist}} earned very little from his musical career. This {{was in part}} due to weak <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> laws in Madagascar, which enabled the profits from {{illegally}} copied albums to go directly to pirates. Throughout his career as a professional musician he lived in the poor neighborhood of Anatihazo-Isotry in Antananarivo with 30members of his family. There he produced instruments and provided lessons in sodina performance. In the later years of his life, Rakoto Frah had over 80students at any given time. He was also a respected source of counsel in the neighborhood and was frequently visited by community members seeking his wisdom and advice. When based in Madagascar, the artist regularly accepted paid offers to perform on the sodina at traditional events such as famadihana (the Malagasy highland [...] "turning of the bones" [...] funerary tradition), circumcision ceremonies, weddings, engagement ceremonies, and traditional festivals held to celebrate the first rice harvest of the year. These events could last up to seven days, including performances throughout the night, and often required several days of travel to arrive at the site. Rakoto Frah was an avid fan of rugby, and he and his ensemble would regularly perform flute and drum music at national team matches. His final international festival performance was the Festival de Langon held in France in August 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Copyright {{infringement}} is reproducing, distributing, displaying or {{performing a}} work, {{or to make}} derivative works, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called [...] "piracy". While copyright is created the instance a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright. <b>Enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> is generally {{the responsibility of the}} copyright holder. The ACTA trade agreement, signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement. There are limitations and exceptions to copyright, allowing limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement. Examples of such doctrines are the fair use and fair dealing doctrine.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} perfect Nash {{equilibrium}} {{in which the}} creator of a work, motivated by economic considerations, selectively enforces her own copyright. In fact, the creator may not only permit, but may strategically promote infringement <b>of</b> the <b>copyright,</b> thereby participating indirectly in predatory pricing, and so raising barriers to entry. Our model is highly applicable to the software industry, where relatively high entry costs and the relatively low cost <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> infringement make this phenomenon likely. We further show {{the conditions under which}} exogenous intervention, through intensive <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights,</b> increases social welfare. Finally, we explore some potential strategies for such legal intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued three {{landmark}} {{decisions in}} 2007 that addressed how copyright protections apply to images {{that can be}} accessed over the Internet.

This Article briefly summarizes the facts of these three cases, explains the central holdings of each decision, and then concludes with a discussion of the collective impact that the three decisions have on <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> in the Internet context and the policy reasons supporting the court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions...|$|R
50|$|The Directive {{requires}} all Member States {{to apply}} effective, dissuasive and proportionate remedies and penalties against those engaged in counterfeiting and piracy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a low complexity and accurate technique for target image search and retrieval. This method, which operates {{directly in the}} compressed JPEG domain, addresses two of the CBIR challenges stated by The Benchathlon Network regarding the search of a specific image: finding out if an exact same image exists in a database, and identifying this occurrence even when the database image has been compressed with a different coding bit-rate. The proposed technique can be applied in feature-containing or featureless image collections, and thus it is also suitable to search for image copies that might exist on the Web for law <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> material. The reported method exploits {{the fact that the}} phase of the Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients contains a significant amount of information of a transformed image. By processing only the phase part of these coefficients, a simple, fast, and accurate target image search and retrieval technique is achieved...|$|R

5000|$|Thematically, Part 2 [...] "examines the {{technological}} and <b>enforcement</b> end <b>of</b> the <b>copyright</b> wars, {{and on the}} way that using the internet makes you a copier, and how copying puts you in legal jeopardy." [...] It discusses Mark Getty's assertion that 'intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century'. Part 2 draws parallels between the impact of the printing press and the internet in terms of making information accessible beyond a privileged group or [...] "controllers". The argument is made that the decentralised nature of the internet makes the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> conventional <b>copyright</b> impossible. Adding to this the internet turns consumers into producers, by way of user generated content, leading to the sharing, mashup and creation of content not motivated by financial gains. This has fundamental implications for market-based media companies.

50|$|Proposals {{for more}} {{vigorous}} <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> laws against individual users may affect copynorms, although both {{the direction and}} magnitude are uncertain.

On the other hand, strict enforcement might cause a backlash, further weakening social support for the copyright laws.|$|E
40|$|According to {{copyright}} system, {{the normal}} standard for protecting {{literary and artistic works}} is originality hence the international copyright treaties such as Berne convention, while emphasizing on originality are avoiding imposing other mandatory standards for protecting such works. However, {{these works are}} different forms of expression of various ideas and accordingly, comprise different contents. In some cases, the works contents are inconsistent with religious and national values and norms or society custom and laws. There are conflicts between protecting copyright as an intellectual property right and other moral, religious and legal priorities in the society. For resolving this conflict and answering the question whether work content will affect copyright protection, countries have adopted different approaches. From the perspective of the work content, this article through a comparative study of approaches and judicial verdicts of the USA, the UK and Canada, infers two general views: the work content does not have any impacts on copyright protection and the work content have impacts on copyright protection. In addition, some supporters of second view believe in content impact on existence <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> in a work and other supporters believe that content has impacts on some <b>enforcements</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{estimates}} of the U. S. economic gains that would result from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are very small [...] only 0. 13 percent of GDP by 2025. Taking into account the un-equalizing effect of trade on wages, this paper finds the median wage earner will probably lose {{as a result of}} any such agreement. In fact, most workers are likely to lose [...] the exceptions being some of the bottom quarter or so whose earnings are determined by the minimum wage; and those with the highest wages who are more protected from international competition. Rather, many top incomes will rise as a result of TPP expansion of the terms and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> and patents. The long-term losses, going forward over the same period (to 2025), from the failure to restore full employment to the United States have been some 25 times greater than the potential gains of the TPP, and more than five times as large as the possible gains resulting from a much broader trade agenda...|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, the {{legislative}} history <b>of</b> the <b>Copyright</b> Act does not suggest that Congress intended to afford similar rights to persons whose copyrights have been infringed. Civil rights plaintiffs are frequently without means, whereas civil rights defendants are typically large companies. The primary objective <b>of</b> the <b>Copyright</b> Act is to [...] "encourage the production of original literary, artistic, and musical expression {{for the good of}} the public." [...] Parties who seek to enforce their copyrights [...] "run the gamut from corporate behemoths to starving artists," [...] just as copyright defendants are equally likely to be wealthy or poor. Thus, the Court found, there is less of a need to provide an economic incentive to individuals in order for there to be adequate <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>copyright</b> law.|$|R

However, the comparison between individual economic gains and losses offers only a partial explanation, as also cultural individual habits and peer effects exert important influences. Using a unique dataset based on a survey conducted at the University of Bologna, Italy, this paper analyses empirically the relevance of socio-economic as well as cultural determinants in the decision process of using illegal copies of university textbooks.
