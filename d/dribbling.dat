5|$|His {{progression}} {{with the}} senior side often saw him compared to teammate Cristiano Ronaldo {{due to the}} similarities in their style as well as Jesé's technical ability, close control, pace and <b>dribbling</b> abilities. Jesé welcomed the comparison to Ronaldo and in a 2013 interview with Marca named the Portuguese legend as his favourite player, ahead of the Brazilian duo of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his <b>dribbling</b> ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped <b>dribbling</b> and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E

5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent <b>dribbling</b> skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by <b>dribbling,</b> passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try {{to regain control of}} the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dribble</b> {{penetration}} is {{very effective}} in breaking down a zone. If a guard can <b>dribble</b> into the gaps in the zone, multiple defenders must converge on the ball.

Although the Welsh {{went on to win}} 0–15, with three {{converted}} tries, they were prevented from scoring in the first half. They were clearly the better team, but the French played with greater passion. Once again, while Neumeyer praised the French forwards, he singled out Guillemin for criticism, creating an imbalance in the French scrum. The Chronique de la Jeunesse, however, highlights Guillemin's <b>dribbling</b> with the ball. Nevertheless, for the final international match of the season against Ireland, Guillemin was dropped from the team, with approval from Reichel, although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement.|$|E

5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent <b>dribbling</b> ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
40|$|Previously, we have {{documented}} that isolated autophagosomes from tumor cells could efficiently cross-prime tumor-reactive naı̈ve T cells and mediate tumor regression in preclinical mouse models. However, {{the effect of}} tumor-derived autophagosomes, here we refer as to <b>DRibbles,</b> on B cells has not been studied so far. At present study, we found that <b>DRibbles</b> generated from a murine hepatoma cell line Hep 1 - 6, induced B-cell activation after intravenous injection into mice. B-cell populations were significantly expanded {{and the production of}} Hep 1 - 6 tumor-specific antibodies was successfully induced. Moreover, in vitro studies showed that <b>DRibbles</b> could induce more efficient B-cell proliferation and activation, antibody production, and cytokine secretion than whole tumor cell lysates. Notably, we found that B-cell activation required proteins but not DNA in the <b>DRibbles.</b> We further showed that B cells could capture <b>DRibbles</b> and present antigens in the <b>DRibbles</b> to directly induce T cell activation. Furthermore, we found that B-cell activation, antibody production, cytokine secretion and antigen cross-presentation were TLR 2 -MyD 88 pathway dependent.

5|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer, Villa {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the best forwards of his generation, and one of the best Spanish strikers of all-time. An opportunistic, versatile and well-rounded player, Villa is naturally right-footed, but an accurate and powerful finisher with either foot, due to his ambidexterity, both inside and outside the area, despite his lack of height or physicality; he is also a set piece and penalty kick specialist. Villa is a quick, agile, and mobile team player, with excellent technique and <b>dribbling</b> skills, who is also known for his work-rate and intelligent offensive movement, as well as his ability to either create space for teammates or make attacking runs into the area. Due to his vision and passing ability, he is also capable of dropping deep to link up play with midfielders, and of creating chances and providing assists for teammates, which has allowed him to be deployed as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder or as a winger throughout his career, in addition to his more common role as a centre-forward.|$|E

After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a <b>dribbling</b> ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, <b>dribbling</b> ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted <b>dribbling</b> skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks.

In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé’s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and <b>dribbling</b> skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.|$|E
