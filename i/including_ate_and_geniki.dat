Sugar beet was loaded here until the late 1980s. In the last years before the goods facilities were closed logs were the only freight to be loaded at Göhrde.|$|R

40|$|The Food Standards Agency (FSA or ‘the Agency’) is an {{independent}} Government department responsible for food safety and hygiene in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

50|$|Dementia is a {{disorder}} characterized by multiple deficits in cognition, including memory impairments. Patients with {{various forms of}} dementia have impairments in their {{activities of daily living}} <b>including</b> <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders have been found in patients with dementia. Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) tend to have an eating disorder where they have food cravings and difficulty controlling the amount and type of food eaten but their memory and spatial functioning is not affected. Meanwhile patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), do not have this impairment, but their memory and spatial loss is negatively affected. Similar findings were shown where patients with fronto variant-frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) show more severe and frequent symptoms of eating disorders than patients with AD. ED in patients with dementia have been tracked back to lesions in the frontal subcortical circuits including the anterior cingulate circuit, and data suggests that ED seem to be distinctive features of behavioural syndromes in groups of patients with fvFTD.|$|R

He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989.
