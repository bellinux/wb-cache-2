40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} developed from {{red blood cells}} a new delivery system called nanoErythrosomes. These nanovesicles offer {{a high degree of}} versatility for the encapsulation of biological or nonbiological compounds and for the binding of targeting agents. In particular, polyethyleneglycols can be conjugated by a covalent link to the basic amino acid residues constitutive of the different proteins. The binding <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> to the nanoErythrosome membrane could be interesting for the therapeutic use of this delivery system since it could overcome heterologous immunogenicity and reduce rapid clearance from circulation. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of temperature on the nanoErythrosome behavior in the absence and presence <b>of</b> conjugated <b>polyethyleneglycols.</b> More specifically, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to evaluate the lipid order and dynamics, the hydration and the degree of protein aggregation of the nanoErythrosomes after covalent binding <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> having molecular weights of 2000 and 5000 g mol− 1. The results indicate that the nanoErythrosome lipid chain order is not significantly affected by heating the nanoErythrosomes at temperatures up to 50 °C. They also indicate that the nanoErythrosome proteins aggregate irreversibly at temperatures above 37 °C, this effect being abolished in the presence <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycols.</b> The presence <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> decreases the accessibility of water to the lipid head groups. On the other hand, 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy results reveal that the presence <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycols</b> prevents the aggregation of the nanoErythrosome structures...|$|R

If a reduced temperature (obtained by dividing the temperature of the solid-liquid transition under pressure by the melting point of PEG at 1 bar) is introduced, the S-L transition of all binary systems are represented by one line.

The intercalation of the polymer chains between the aluminosilicates layers and morphological structure of the filled PLAs were analysed by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed to study the thermal behaviour of the prepared composites. At constant filler level, it appears that from all the clays studied, the montmorillonite organo-modified by bis-(2 -hydroxyethyl) methyl (hydrogenated tallowalkyl) ammonium cations brings the greater effect in terms of thermal stability. Increasing the amount of clay allows to delay the onset of thermal degradation of the plasticized polymer matrix. It was also pointed out, by WAXS and DSC analyses, that it exists a real competition between PEG 1000 and PLA for the intercalation into the interlayer spacing of the clay.

Phagocytosis of PEG-PLGA-NPs by murine peritoneal macrophages involved serum-independent and serum-dependent phagocytosis.

40|$|Ultrasmall-angle X-ray {{scattering}} {{is employed}} {{to probe the}} local and long wavelength collective structure of ternary mixtures of silica nanoparticles suspended in concentrated solutions <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> in the good solvent ethanol. In the dilute polymer limit, these suspensions are stabilized via electrostatic repulsions, at intermediate polymer concentrations the nanoparticles aggregate, while in the polymer melt limit they again become homogeneous due {{to the formation of}} thermodynamically stable discrete adsorbed polymer layers on the nanoparticles. Solvent dilution of the polymer melt is found to modify the nanoparticle concentration fluctuations on all length scales in a manner that can be understood as a monotonic reduction of the favorable polymer particle interfacial cohesive attraction. The measurements are quantitatively compared with predictions of the two-component Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model theory modified to account in an implicit manner for solvent addition via an effective contact strength of interfacial attraction, epsilon(pc). Good agreement between theory and experiment is found without adjustable parameters {{based on the idea that}} epsilon(pc) linearly decreases with solvent volume fraction. The joint experimental-theoretical work suggests a new mechanism for restabilization of aggregated particle suspensions at high polymer concentration based on the thermodynamically controlled interface cohesion of weakly adsorbing polymers that contrasts with the classic kinetic repulsive barrier mechanism under nonadsorbing depletion attraction conditionsclose 181...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe goal of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether microbubble charge influences the microvascular retention of microbubble contrast agents. BackgroundInteractions between serum proteins and lipid membranes are greater with anionic compared with neutral membranes. These interactions may influence the microvascular behavior of anionic lipid microbubbles. MethodsIntravital microscopy of the cremaster muscle was performed in six wild-type mice and three C 3 -deficient mice during intravenous injection of lipid-shelled microbubbles with either a neutral or a negative charge. Both agents were prepared with and without a protective surface layer <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> (PEG). Complement attachment to microbubbles was assessed by flow cytometry with flourescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-C 3 b monoclonal antibody. Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed in six dogs to assess pulmonary and myocardial retention of microbubbles. ResultsSize-independent capillary retention of microbubbles, occurring for a few seconds to > 10 min, was frequently observed with anionic, but rarely with neutral, microbubbles (4. 3 ± 0. 3 vs. 0. 4 ± 0. 1 mm− 3, p 10 min after bolus intravenous injection. ConclusionsLipid microbubbles with a net negative charge can be retained within capillaries via complement-mediated attachment to endothelium. This property may be useful for the development of ultrasound contrast agents that can be imaged late after venous injection...|$|R
40|$|Glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PDH) is {{an important}} enzyme used in biochemical and medical studies and in several analytical methods that have industrial and commercial application. This work evaluated the extraction of G 6 PDH in aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) <b>of</b> <b>poly(ethyleneglycol)</b> (PEG) /phosphate buffer, using as enzyme source a medium prepared through commercial baker’s yeast disruption. Firstly, the effects of PEG molar mass on the enzyme partition and of homogenization and rest on the system equilibrium were investigated. Afterwards, several ATPS were prepared using statistical analysis (2 2 factorial design). The results, including kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the G 6 PDH activity, showed partial purification of this enzyme in ATPS composed of 17. 5 % (w/w) PEG 400 and 15. 0 % (w/w) phosphate. A high enzymatic recovery value (97. 7 %), a high partition coefficient (351), and an acceptable purification factor (2. 28 times higher than in cell homogenate) were attained from the top phase. So, {{it was possible to}} attain an effective enzyme pre-purification by separating some contaminants with a simple method such as liquid-liquid extraction in aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS).

40|$|The current {{shortages}} in human plasma products at global levels justify {{the development of}} new, cost effective plasma fractionation methods. We have developed a fractionation process to obtain immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin-enriched fractions based on polymer-salt aqueous two phase system (ATPS). A small-scale (0. 02 L) ATPS composed <b>of</b> <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> 3350 (PEG), potassium phosphate and sodium chloride, at pH 6. 1, was evaluated and subjected to 50 -fold scale-up (1 L). Further purification of the fractions was performed using caprylic acid precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. Similar yield and purity were obtained at both small and large scales. IgG precipitated in the PEG rich upper phase at 83 % recovery and 2. 75 -fold purification factor. An 81 % pure albumin fraction was obtained in the salt rich bottom phase with a 91 % yield. After polishing, IgG was obtained at a recovery of 70 % and a purity of 92 %. Corresponding values for albumin were 91 % and 90 %. This IgG and albumin fractionation technology deserves further evaluation as it may represent a potential alternative to conventional plasma fractionation methodsUniversidad de Costa Rica/[741 -B 0 - 113]/UCR/Costa RicaUCR::Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP...|$|R
