40|$|Licorice, {{which is}} the {{underground}} part of Glycyrrhiza species, has been used widely in Asian and Western countries as a traditional medicine and as a food additive. Our continuous investigation on the constituents of roots and stolons of Glycyrrhiza uralensis led to the isolation of two new phenolics, in addition to 14 known compounds. Structural studies including spectroscopic and simple chemical derivatizations revealed that both of the new compounds had 2 -aryl- 3 -methylbenzofuran structures. An examination {{of the effectiveness of}} licorice phenolics obtained in this study on vancomycin-resistant strains Enterococcus faecium FN- 1 and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 12201 revealed that licoricidin showed the most potent antibacterial effects against both of E. faecalis and E. faecium with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1. 9 × 10 − 5 M. 8 -(γ,γ-Dimethylallyl) -wighteone, isoangustone A, 3 '-(γ,γ-dimethylallyl) -kievitone, glyasperin C, and one of the new 3 -methyl- 2 -phenylbenzofuran named neoglycybenzofuran also showed potent anti-vancomycin-resistant Enterococci effects (MIC 1. 9 × 10 − 5 – 4. 5 × 10 − 5 M for E. faecium and E. faecalis).
