5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> <b>driving</b> or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has begun}} to provide {{valuable}} insight into the impact of drink driving rehabilitation programs on key program outcomes such as motivations to change problem behaviours, and self-efficacy levels to control such behaviours. The present study reports on the self-reported impact of an Australian rehabilitation program {{on a group of}} recidivist offenders' <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> behaviours (N = 87). The findings indicate that program completion produced a positive impact on participants’ motivations to change both their <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> behaviours, although the majority of participants continued to drink heavily after completing the program. In addition, participants reported high levels of self-efficacy to control both their <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drink <b>driving</b> behaviours before <b>and</b> after program completion. Importantly, participants' appraisal regarding the effectiveness of the program was not associated with motivations to change problem behaviours. The findings have direct implications for the development of effective programs that address not only the act of drink driving, but also the problem of harmful levels of alcohol consumption...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{many decades}} of {{prevention}} efforts, alcohol related traffic injuries and deaths due to <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drunken <b>driving</b> remain major problems in communities throughout the US. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has recently sponsored an extensive {{study of the}} etiology of these problems across mid-size cities in California and is currently supporting an evaluation of community-based environmental preventive interventions intended to reduce these problems in 24 of these cities.   One of the primary concerns of these studies has been to identify the ecological causes <b>and</b> correlates of <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drunken <b>driving</b> {{in order to better}} tailor prevention efforts.   If we can identify the primary sources of drinking drivers in community settings, we can tailor prevention efforts to drinkers in those settings and develop effective behavioral ecological interventions.   The challenges are to develop a comprehensive representation of sources of <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> drunken <b>driving</b> in community settings, and then use that information to guide prevention efforts.

40|$|BackgroundPublic {{policy can}} limit alcohol {{consumption}} {{and its associated}} harms, but no direct comparison of the relative efficacy of alcohol control policies exists for the U. S. PurposeTo identify alcohol control policies and develop quantitative ratings of their efficacy and strength of evidence. MethodsIn 2010, a Delphi panel of ten U. S. alcohol policy experts identified and rated the efficacy of alcohol control policies for reducing binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-impaired <b>driving</b> among both the general population and youth, {{and the strength of}} evidence informing the efficacy of each policy. The policies were nominated based on scientific evidence and potential for public health impact. Analysis was conducted in 201022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2012. ResultsPanelists identified and rated 47 policies. Policies limiting price received the highest ratings, with alcohol taxes receiving the highest ratings for all four outcomes. Highly rated policies for reducing binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-impaired <b>driving</b> in the general population were also highly rated among youth, although several policies were rated more highly for youth compared with the general population. Policy efficacy ratings for the general population and youth were positively correlated for reducing both binge drinking (r = 0. 50) <b>and</b> alcohol-impaired <b>driving</b> (r = 0. 45). The correlation between efficacy ratings for reducing binge <b>drinking</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-impaired <b>driving</b> was strong for the general population (r = 0. 88) and for youth (r = 0. 85). Efficacy ratings were positively correlated with strength-of-evidence ratings. ConclusionsComparative policy ratings can help characterize the alcohol policy environment, inform policy discussions, and identify future research needs.
