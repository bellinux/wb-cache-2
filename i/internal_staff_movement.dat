40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{theoretical}} and practical implications of the mirroring principle {{to an understanding of}} how best to identify and sustain service brands' values. It does this through a focus on the web design aesthetics used in the web sites of small to large companies, and a comparison of these aesthetics with the preferences of target users. Web design contributes to services branding and a finding of a tendency of the majority of websites to employ what may be termed a ‘male design aesthetic’, and for men and women to have a differential preference as between the male and female design aesthetic, leads to a discussion of the appropriateness of previous service branding models. These earlier models discuss the role of <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> in developing service branding values but neglect to consider the dissonance that may exist between the values of <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> and the values of external customers. The article argues that only where the values of <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> are congruent with those of external customers is it appropriate to model brand values around the preferences of <b>internal</b> <b>staff.</b> In those other cases where the brand values of <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> do not span the complete range of aesthetic choices available, questions need to be asked about how best these external values can be reflected in the marketing and design of services targeted at customers. There are implications here for recruitment, promotion and training that are not currently reflected in existing services branding models, and which therefore, serve as an important addition to the services branding model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} that was undertaken to understand the perceptions of both dealers and <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> about a sales promotion that was employed by the company. In terms of general attitudes to promotions, sales representatives and dealers both saw promotions as purely sales driven, in terms of objectives and evaluations. However, senior staff saw sales promotions as having a relationship building role and as a motivator for <b>staff.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> we spoke to were sceptical {{about the effectiveness of}} such promotions with the sales reps perceiving that they would have achieved the sales anyway and the senior staff unsure how to assess these more abstract objectives. The key findings were the identification of the areas perceived by dealers and/or <b>internal</b> <b>staff</b> as impacting upon a sales promotion. These were: ability to attract attention, simplicity, having realistic targets, having good support material, appropriate incentives, efficient logistics, communication of benefits and sales support. It was also important to ensure that the goals of the promotion, as set by the company, were able to provide a benefit to the dealers...|$|R

Therefore, KakaoTalk can expend minimal manpower for development, {{and it has a}} competitive edge by concentrating on its core activities. In a mobile ecosystem, there are more disadvantages than advantages to monopolize content with <b>internal</b> <b>staff,</b> such as how Naver operates. On the other hand, it has a great advantage in that it provides both speed and quality for parties to supply content from outside the platform.|$|R
