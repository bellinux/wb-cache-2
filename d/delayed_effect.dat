Studies on mammals indicate that exposures to some chemicals during embryonic development at concentrations that do not produce anatomical malformations may nevertheless produce behavioral deficits later in life, an example of <b>delayed</b> <b>effects.</b> There have been reports of <b>delayed</b> <b>effects</b> in aquatic organisms. <b>Delayed</b> behavioral <b>effects</b> of mercury, chlorinated and other pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some synthetic hormones in the environment have been reported in fishes and invertebrates; in some cases behavioral effects are manifested years after the exposure.

Over time, Grzebski's aging caused the tumor to shrink enough to relieve pressure on his brain stem, and he eventually and gradually regained full consciousness. Grzebski began to wake from his coma in 1992. Doctors had not expected Grzebski to survive, let alone emerge from the coma. He credited his survival to his wife, Gertruda Grzebska, who cared and prayed for him. Grzebski was a father of four {{at the time of the}} accident. While disabled he gained eleven grandchildren. In an interview on 1 June 2007, with the Polish news channel TVN 24, Grzebski described his recollections of the communist system's economic collapse. [...] "When my family spoke to me, I could actually hear them but I could not talk back. I could not send them a signal to tell them that I was still alive." [...] Afterwards, Grzebski died in 2008 from the brain tumor soon after he awoke in 2007. Jan Grzebski had lived in an invalid state for 19 years of his 66-year life.|$|E
