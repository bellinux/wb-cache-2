5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} self-contained line that does not operate <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders.

Skilled side-mount divers may carry {{as many as three}} cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E

5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> symbols. The flag of the People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, {{the date of the}} PLA's founding). The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. Despite this, at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies that the law is either repealed or not enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} soldiers fulfilled {{a number}} of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the conquest of Indochina, helping to defeat the forces of the Nguyễn Dynasty and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> armed institutions, such as the Garde indigène (later indochinoise), the gendarmerie, the police, and the irregular partisans in the border regions. The Garde indigène, a paramilitary force, was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus {{played an important role in}} the repression of public demonstrations and popular unrest.|$|E

The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
5|$|Usage of {{the flag}} is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws {{relating}} to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use {{of the flag}} by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> national and non-national flags.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) {{emergency}} meeting {{concluded that the}} RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, <b>in</b> <b>conjunction</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E
