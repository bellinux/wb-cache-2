25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it in one piece.|$|E
2500|$|On November 21, 2006, Denise Brown accused Fox {{of trying}} to stop the Goldman and Brown {{families}} from criticizing the project by offering millions of dollars for their silence surrounding the project: [...] "They wanted to offer us millions of dollars. Millions of dollars for, like, 'Oh, I'm sorry' money. But they were still going to air the show," [...] Brown said. [...] "We just thought, 'Oh my God.' What they're trying to do <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> us quiet, trying to make this like hush money, trying to go around the civil verdict, giving us this money to keep our mouths shut." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{alternate}} future of [...] "Five Years Gone", Noah Bennet (who is not wearing his trademark horn-rimmed glasses) works together with Hana Gitelman {{to protect people}} with superpowers from being persecuted by a now fearful government. It is revealed that he <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Claire hidden from the registry. Though he is estranged from Claire, he visits her at the diner to warn her to get away. When he arrives back at work, he discovers Hana has been killed, and Matt Parkman, now head of the Department of Homeland Security, and his men are waiting for him. He does not realize Parkman has murdered Hana and broken their agreement, and hands Parkman a picture drawn by his son. Parkman holds a gun to him and demands to know where Claire is. Bennet refuses to answer, so Parkman reads Bennet's mind to extract Claire's location. Parkman then shoots Bennet in the head.|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky, {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Daredevil and Jessica Jones, serves as costume designer for Luke Cage as well. The series sees Cage have a wardrobe evolution from his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket that {{was introduced in}} Jessica Jones. Maslansky took inspiration from the comics illustrations, as she did on the other Marvel Netflix series, but also looked to the [...] "rich and colorful history" [...] of Harlem, and Coker's own vision. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing for the series, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. The series' title sequence, which uses yellow overtones, blends a silhouette of Luke Cage with images of Harlem.|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky {{returned from}} the same role on Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in Jessica Jones. The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, [...] "is not made for serious moments", but the series was able to poke fun {{at it in the}} brief scene, with Cage saying [...] "You look like a damn fool" [...] to himself when wearing it. In looking to pay homage to Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as [...] "a wealthy, successful businessman", and wears a lot of suits from Dolce & Gabbana and Zegna. One of his suits for the show was custom made. To pay homage to the comic character, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a [...] "subtle shade of green" [...] to avoid being [...] "flamboyant". The character subsequently is always wearing a [...] "subtle piece of green", like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character. For the character Shades, brands such as Hugo Boss, Helmut Lang, Prada, and Ferragamo were used [...] "because he wasn't trying to hide who he was", while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume. That look includes leather pants and an [...] "interesting cold-shoulder"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.|$|E

60|$|But {{look at it}} thus. At least I {{have been}} {{speaking}} {{of the works of}} God. And are not you, too, a work of God? The Lord shall rejoice in His works, even to the tiniest gnat that dances in the sun. Is the Lord rejoicing in you? I have said--Whither shall a man go from God's presence? Are you forgetting or remembering God's presence? And--Whither shall a man flee from God's Spirit? Are you, O man, fleeing from God's Spirit, and forgetting His gracious inspirations; all pure and holy, and noble, and just and lovely and truly human, thoughts, in the whirl of pleasure, or covetousness, or ambition, or actual sin? If so, look at the tiniest gnat which dances in the air, the meanest flower beneath your feet; and be ashamed, and fear, and tremble before the Living God, and before His Spirit. For the gnat and the flower are doing their duty, and pleasing the Holy Spirit of God; and you are not doing your duty, and are grieving the Holy Spirit of God. For simply: because that Spirit is the Spirit of God, He is a Holy Spirit, who tries to make you--O man and not animal--holy; a moral, and spiritual, and good being. Because you are a moral and spiritual being, God's Spirit exercises over you a moral power which He does not exercise over the plants and animals. He works not merely on your body and your brain: but on your heart and immortal soul. But if you choose to be immoral, when He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you moral; if you choose to be carnal like the brutes, while He is trying to make you spiritual, like Jesus Christ, from whom He proceeds: then, oh then, tremble, and beware, and be ashamed before the very flowers which grow in your own garden-bed; for they fulfil the law which God has given them. They are what they ought to be, each after its kind. But you are not what you ought to be, after your kind; which is a good man, or a good woman, or a good child.|$|E
