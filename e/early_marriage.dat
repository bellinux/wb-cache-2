5|$|Cameroon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} school {{attendance}} rates in Africa. Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, <b>early</b> <b>marriage,</b> pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{families}} were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even {{father and son}} have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of <b>early</b> <b>marriage</b> for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 {{years of age and}} the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.|$|E
5|$|Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 {{after a long}} illness. Lucy {{continued}} to meet with Roosevelt {{in the months that}} followed more frequently. In June 1944, Franklin requested of his daughter Anna, who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess, that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor's knowledge. Aware of Rutherfurd's role in her parents' <b>early</b> <b>marriage,</b> Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position. However, she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown. To her surprise, Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately, and the pair became friends. There were supposedly several dinners in the White House's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna's presence and obvious acceptance. When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR's death from the female cousins of Anna's role in arranging for these meetings, the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time.|$|E

5|$|Darius {{was the son}} of Hystaspes and the {{grandson}} of Arsames. Both men belonged to the Achaemenid tribe and were still alive when Darius ascended the throne. Darius justifies his ascension to the throne with his lineage. He claimed he could trace his ancestors back to Achaemenes, even though he was only distantly related. With this in mind, Darius married Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had four sons: Xerxes, Achaemenes, Masistes and Hystaspes. He also married Artystone, another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two sons, Arsames and Gobryas. Darius married Parmys, the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, Ariomardus. Furthermore, Darius married Phratagune, with whom he had two sons, Abrokomas and Hyperantes. He also married another woman of the nobility, Phaidyme, the daughter of Otanes. It is unknown if he had any children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier Gobryas from an <b>early</b> <b>marriage,</b> with whom he had three sons, Artobazanes, Ariabignes and Arsamenes. Any daughters he had with her are not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of Atossa; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.|$|E

However, later in their lives, the couple became fond and loving companions.|$|E
25|$|In rural Amhara in 2003/04, {{there were}} strong social and {{cultural}} pressures for girls to marry before they were 14 years old. Virginity before marriage was highly valued and an unmarried girl over 14 year was stigmatized. She was an embarrassment to herself and her family and regarded as a financial burden since her contribution to domestic and agricultural activities was not valued. The age of first marriage had been declining since the mothers' average age of marriage was 11 years while their daughters' average age of marriage was 8 years. <b>Early</b> <b>marriage</b> allowed formation of bonds between families and, when families were land rich, it maintained their land holdings. Sons from land poor families, who had {{reached the age of}} 18, could obtain land from the peasants association if they married. There was no need for brides to be 18 and they were often under 11 years old. Boys, but not girls, were expected to be successful at the local school. Success for a girl was as a wife and mother and <b>early</b> <b>marriage</b> provided recognition in the community.|$|E

50|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{many girls}} enter into {{arranged}} marriages soon after menarche (usually {{between the ages}} of 9 and 15). Social factors and economic factors contribute to this practice of <b>early</b> <b>marriages.</b> Socially, some grooms want to ensure their brides are virgins when they get married, so an <b>earlier</b> <b>marriage</b> is desirable. Economically, the bride price received and having one less person to feed in the family helps alleviate the financial burdens of the bride's family. <b>Early</b> <b>marriages</b> lead to <b>early</b> childbirth, which increases the risk of obstructed labor, since young mothers who are poor and malnourished may have underdeveloped pelvises. In fact, obstructed labor is responsible for 76 to 97% of obstetric fistulae.|$|R

25|$|Cultural/traditional {{practices}} do not favour girl’s education. Girls only represent 20% {{of pupils}} in {{primary and secondary}} schools (forced and <b>early</b> <b>marriage</b> plays important role). Some parents refused daughters school because they could learn about family planning and contraception and other ways of critical thinking. However girls {{are more willing to}} partake in learning because education is a means to free themselves from family oppression. There is a rule requiring boys and girls to eat together at school. This has encouraged the coeducational idea, in sharp contrast to traditional practice, particularly for the Sudanese.|$|E
25|$|Galton {{invented the}} term {{eugenics}} in 1883 and set down {{many of his}} observations and conclusions in a book, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development. He believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and <b>early</b> <b>marriage</b> between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed {{out some of the}} tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were dysgenic. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.|$|E
25|$|As sex {{and gender}} are {{inextricably}} linked in day-to-day life, their union {{is apparent in}} medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males {{tend to have a}} health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, <b>early</b> <b>marriage,</b> and domestic abuse for females. In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females. The leading causes of the higher male death rate are accidents, injuries, violence, and cardiovascular diseases. In a number of countries, males also face a heightened risk of mortality as a result of behavior and greater propensity for violence.|$|E

25|$|During {{this whole}} period Babbage {{depended}} awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his <b>early</b> <b>marriage,</b> of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made {{a home in}} Marylebone in London, and founded a large family. On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around £100,000, equivalent to £ or $ today), making him independently wealthy. After his wife's death {{in the same year}} he spent time travelling. In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont. In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).|$|E

By this time Octavian returns (in men's clothes) ("Ach, du bist wieder da"), she has realized {{that one day he}} will leave her ("Die Zeit, die ist ein sonderbar Ding"). She muses on the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times), and turns Octavian away. After he has left, she suddenly realizes that she has forgotten to kiss him goodbye, and sends some footmen after him; however, it is too late, he is gone. The Marschallin summons her page to take the silver rose to Octavian to deliver to Sophie. After Mohammed departs, she stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.|$|E
25|$|James {{cautions}} that available scientific evidence stands against the above assumptions and conclusions. He {{reports that there}} is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as <b>early</b> <b>marriage</b> and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and harmonal effects. This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies. They suggest that direct abortion data should be collected and studied, instead of drawing conclusions indirectly from human sex ratio at birth.|$|E
