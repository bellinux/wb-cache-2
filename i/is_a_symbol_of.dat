In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> this imperfectness.|$|E

5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> {{shedding}} {{the social}} self and its constraints to then embrace {{the freedom of}} the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand.

It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace.

It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> England, representing strength and endurance.

5|$|According to Ludvík Mucha, {{author of}} Webster's Concise Encyclopedia of Flags & Coats of Arms, the white disk {{located in the}} center of the flag {{represents}} the sun. The red crescent and the five-pointed star, two ancient symbols of Islam, were most notably used on Ottoman flag and have since appeared on many flags of Islamic countries. The crescent is, from the viewpoint of an Arabic observer, supposed to bring good luck. The color red <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> resistance against Turkish supremacy. Whitney Smith states that the crescent was first emblazoned on standards and buildings in the Punic state of Carthage, located in present-day Tunisia. Since appearing on the Ottoman flag, they were widely adopted by Muslim countries, and have become known as symbols of Islam, when in fact, they may be cultural symbols. Likewise, the sun is often represented with the crescent on ancient Punic artifacts and is associated with the ancient Punic religion, especially with Tanit symbol.|$|E
