5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> were willing to cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which {{saw to it that}} these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E

5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E

25|$|Among the <b>intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> {{attended}} {{his lectures}} were Mihail Şora (whom he deemed his favorite student), Eugen Schileru and Miron Constantinescu—known later as, respectively, a philosopher, an art critic, and a sociologist and political {{figure of the}} communist regime. Mariana Klein, who became Șora's wife, was one of Eliade's female students, and later authored works on his scholarship.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} and {{translation of the}} Nag Hammadi library after 1945 has had a huge effect on Gnosticism since World War II. <b>Intellectuals</b> <b>who</b> were heavily influenced by Gnosticism in this period include Lawrence Durrell, Hans Jonas, Philip K.

25|$|In 1909, Slavici {{began work}} for the pro-German {{newspaper}} Ziua.

25|$|In the Middle East, {{liberalism}} led to constitutional periods, {{like the}} Ottoman First and Second Constitutional Era and the Persian constitutional period, but {{declined in the}} late 1930s due the growth and opposition of islamism and Pan-Arab nationalism.
