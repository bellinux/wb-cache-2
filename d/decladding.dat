A single material of construction {{which could be used}} for a processing complex which would handle all of the low-enrichment fuels concerned was searched for. In the Zirflex Process (NH/sub 4 /F-NH/sub 4 /NO/sub 3 /) the 300 series stainless steels, vacuum-melted Hastelloy-F, Carpenter 20, Nio- nel, Haynes 25, and Incoloy 804 have satisfactory corrosion resistance to solutions involved in the dissolution of Zr or Zircaloy claddings. Satisfactory dissolution rates for 304 -L stainless steel cladding are obtained in the Niflex Process (1 MHNC/sub 3 /- 2 MHF) solutions.

For this purpose, the <b>decladded</b> core of an optical fibre was sputtered with gold and afterwards coated with defined layers of stearic acid or animal fat to obtain a kind of model dirtiness. The deposition of stearic acid was performed using a Langmuir Blodgett through, and the sensor followed on-line the deposition of the respective monolayers by UV/VIS spectroscopy, appearing as a distinct and constant shift in wavelength. Moreover, functional coatings were applied above the gold layer to achieve a variation of the hydrophilicity of the sensor surface. The SPR sensor proved to be easy to use, accurate and flexible. It offers a new solution that could replace the existing methods for detergency sensing and with a customized design it could be a useful industry tool since the small size of the dip sensor promises massive testing.

40|$|The DOE {{inventory}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} consists of approximately 2700 tonnes heavy metal (MTHM), containing over 100 different fuel types. The current plan for the disposition of this fuel is to condition it for dry storage until it can {{be placed in a}} geological repository. However, the variation in the physical condition and chemical composition of DOE spent fuel complicates the task of qualifying the fuel for repository disposal. Each type or category of fuel must be characterized and certified to meet repository disposal criteria, an expensive and time-consuming process. Some of the fuel types contain chemically reactive components (such as metallic sodium), which must be stabilized prior to long-term storage or disposal. Finally, some of the fuel is damaged or <b>declad,</b> and some has already been altered by its present storage environment, making it difficult to qualify that general type of fuel for disposal. The electrometallurgical (EM) treatment technique developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has the potential to convert many of these spent fuel types into a uniform set of three product streams (uranium metal, metal waste form, ceramic waste form).

The final phase of the laboratory program involved the dissolution and characterization of materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using a selected caustic/ nitric acid flowsheet. Laboratory results obtained from the initial dissolution studies identified several inconsistencies and potential problem issues with the behavior of materials from the color coded fuel rods.

Niflex solutions which were more corrosive than Sulfex solutions {{to most of the}} experimental alloys, produced severe localized attack on weldments made on vacuum-melted Hastelloy F with the experimental alloys. However, several of the alloys, when self-welded, were not selectively attacked. Some of these showed a substantial improvement in resistance to the <b>decladding</b> solutions. The most promising alloys were based on either 45 wt. % nickel [...] 22 wt. % chromium or 50 wt. % nickel [...] 25 wt. % chromium, with at least 6 wt. % molybdenum, and 1 wt. % titanium, 0. 6 wt. % manganese, 0. 4 wt. % silicon, 0. 02 wt. % carbon, and the balance, iron.

Its corrosion rate of 22 mils per month in Niflex, with no selective attack, was significantly lower than the 105 mils per month recorded for Hastelloy F. Even lower rates would be expected under the less stringent conditions of actual process operation. Indications are that more resistance might be obtained by increasing the chromium and nickel contents. (auth...|$|E

The ruthenium complex [Ru“-tris(4 t 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenantroline) ] was chosen for this work and was immobilised in a microporous glass, produced by the low temperature sol-gel process. The advantages of using this method of reagent capture are explained and the method of sensor fabrication described. A number of experimental systems have been employed.

Flooding throughputs for the Mark I stacked- clone contactor ranged from 600 cc/min organic at zero aqueous to 60 cc/min organic at 1950 cc aqueous. A large electronic vibrator of 5000 -lb thrust was found somewhat inferior to pneumatic vibration for compacting oxide fuels into stainless-steel tubes. Tests were {{started on the}} use of fixed-bed CuO oxidizers for removing hydrogen contamination from helium gas streams. None of the variables studied within this period effected an increase in particle size in the denitration of thorium nitrate to produce ThO/sub 2 /. The rate of uranyl sulfate loading on nitrate equilibrated Dowex 21 K appears to be essentially independent of the loading solution sulfate concentration. The nitric acid concentrations corresponding to maximum UO/sub 2 /-ThO/sub 2 / pellet dissolution rate were 15. 5 M for Thorex solution and 13 M for the adjusted Darex solution. Two additional Semicontinuous Sulfex <b>declad</b> and Thorex core dissolutions of prototype Consolidated Edison fuel assemblies were made to complete the series of runs.

40|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} aspect of increasing the safety and reliability of large structures such as aircraft, ships, submarines and bridges. In general, current non-destructive corrosion detection techniques are only able to detect local changes after significant damage has occurred. Moreover, corrosion often localises in areas that are inaccessible for inspection, especially in large structures. This implies a need for sensitive detection systems with multiple sensors in order to monitor the initial stages of corrosion over large areas. Thus, the development of a wide-area detection system for continuously monitoring structural changes, together with a capability for non-destructive evaluation and early warning, {{is an important}} task. The aim of the present research is to evaluate the feasibility of a distributed optical fibre sensor for detecting corrosion at arbitrary points of interest in a large structure. A detection method based on the estimation of water ingress into conventional optical fibre during the corrosion process was tested. This method was based on changes in the water peak absorption in a sensor made from conventional optical fibre. This did not give conclusive results. This method may be attractive for sensor designs based on hygroscopic glasses or fibres with small cladding thickness. In the method chosen for further development, the fluorescence from the complex Tris-(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq 3) produced by the reaction of Al 3 + ions with the indicator 8 -HQ was detected. A theoretical model was developed to evaluate the evanescent field interaction mechanism and critical parameters of the detection system. This suggested that fluorescent emissions generated by the evanescent field and coupled back into guided modes could be detected by means of photon counting technology. Moreover, the location of the fluorescence could be resolved by measuring the time-offlight of the fluorescent emission returned from a short excitation pulse. Two constructions of the optical fibre sensor, based on etched D-shaped fibre and <b>declad</b> plastic-clad fibre, were examined as sensing elements for distributed measurements. Evaluation of the results in terms of practical considerations such as cost, additional development requirements and the risks to achieving the required results, led to the choice of a plastic clad fibre that could be easily <b>declad</b> as a sensing element for the detection system. A system based on pulsed excitation and time-gated photon counting was used to detect a localized source of fluorescence at an arbitrary position along the fibre length. Environments examined were the complex Alq 3 excited at 405 nm and the infrared dye IR- 125, excited at 780 nm. A model to characterize the response of the sensor to a Gaussian input pulse was developed and tested. Analysis of the Alq 3 fluorescence response confirmed the validity of the model and enabled the fluorescence lifetime to be determined. The decay rate was found to be proportional to concentration, which is indicative of collisional deactivation. The intrinsic lifetime obtained (18. 2 +/- 0. 9 ns) is in good agreement with published data. The minimum Alq 3 concentration that could be detected is 5 x 10 ^- 5 M (~ 20 ppm) over an exposed length of 0. 2 m, whereas the detection limit for IR- 125 is 2 x 10 ^- 6 M (~ 1. 2 ppm). The model allows the spatial resolution of the distributed sensing system to be improved in those cases where the fluorophore lifetime is longer than the resolution of the sensing system. The absorbance and fluorescence response of the multimode optical fibre evanescent wave sensor was analysed to investigate the influence of different conditions, such as environmental refractive index, excitation wavelength, and launching conditions. Theoretical models were developed to investigate and improve the efficiency of the optical fibre detection system. The potential for using the developed detection system in practical sensing applications was successfully demonstrated in a stimulated corrosion test...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program, {{aluminide}} fuels (UAl{sub x}) {{are being}} tested under conditions that might exist in the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Intermittent drip tests at 90 C were completed for up to 183 days on partially <b>declad,</b> unirradiated, low-enriched UAl{sub x} samples. Through 183 days of exposure to modified water from the J- 13 well at 90 C, the fuel coupon remained in good mechanical condition.

The mechanism for alteration is consistent with that observed from dry oxidation experiments on UAl{sub x} (for the initial corrosion) and humid UO{sub 2 } oxidation (for the subsequent paragenesis). Specifically, solid-state conversion of UAl{sub x} into UO{sub 2 } and oxidized Al is followed by further oxidation, dissolution of the uranium, and reprecipitation as uranyl oxyhydroxides. The release rate of uranium varied from 0. 23 to 2. 9 mg/m{sup 2 }/day (avg. = 0. 97 mg U/m{sup 2 }/day) depending on the specimen and test interval, but was similar in magnitude to that observed in earlier flow-through and drip tests with irradiated UAl{sub x} and UO{sub 2 }. Most (mean= 87 %) of the released uranium sorbed to the vessel walls. Colloids were detected in the leachate samples, and dynamic light scattering of aliquots from most sampling periods favored a polydisperse distribution typical of environmental samples. In addition, the light scattering intensities measured in these tests were much higher than any measured from UO{sub 2 } fuel tests in our laboratory. Electron microscopy of the colloids indicated that the colloids were individual and agglomerated silicates and aluminosilicates. No distinct uranium-rich colloids were found, although dissolved uranium would be expected to sorb to aluminosilicate colloids. In conclusion, the UAl{sub x} corroded slowly, releasing uranium at a rate comparable to UO{sub 2 } fuels.

40|$|A 'Feasibility Study on the Commercialized Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) Cycle System' is {{underway}} at Japan Nuclear Cycle Development Institute (JNC). Concepts to commercialize the FBR fuel cycle are being created {{together with their}} necessary research and development (R&D) tasks. 'Dry,' non-aqueous, processes are candidates for FBR fuel reprocessing. Dry reprocessing technology takes advantage of proliferation barriers, due to the lower decontamination factors achievable by the simple pyrochemical processes proposed. The concentration o f highly radioactive impurities and non-fissile materials in products from a dry reprocess is generally significantly larger than the normal aqueous (Purex) process. However, the safeguards of dry reprocesses have not been widely analyzed. In 2000, JNC and Los Alamos National Laboratoiy (LANL) initiated a joint research program to study the safeguards aspects of dry reprocessing. In this study, the safeguardability of the three options: metal electrorefining, oxide electrowinning, and fluoride volatility processes, are assessed. FBR spent fuels are <b>decladded</b> and powdered into mixed oxides (MOX) at the Head-End process either by oxidation-reduction reactions (metal electrorefining and fluoride volatility) or mechanically (oxide electrowinning). At the oxide electrowinning process, the spent MOX he 1 powder is transferred to chloride in molten salt and nuclear materials are extracted onto cathode as oxides. For metal electrorefining process, on the other hand, the MOX fuel is converted to chloride in molten salt, and nuclear materials are extracted onto cathode as a metal fomi. At lhe fluoride volatility process, the MOX fuel powder is converted to U&/PuF 6 (gaseous form) in a fluidized bed; plutonium and uranium fluorides are separated by volatilization properties and then are converted to oxides. Since the conceptual design of a dry reprocessing plant is incomplete, the operational mode, vessel capacities, residence times, and campaigns are not fully defined. Preliminary estimates of the longest acccptable campaign length while still meets loss detection goals were made using typical measurement errors and annual throughputs of plutonium within the facility. For all reprocessing facilities, both in-process inventory and the input/output materials measurements must be determined for closing the materials balance. Usually, operations are {{to be shut down}} periodically and plants are to be completely cleaned out to recover all materials in measurable forms during inventories. If there is no cleanout between campaigns, fluctuations of in-process inventory have to be monitored. We conclude that the three dry reprocessing methods will have adequate safeguardability, if limited to small-scale campaigns or to low annual throughputs. For a large scale, e. g,. 50 t(HM) /y FBR fuel reprocessing plant, there remain challenges to be addressed through process development in JNC and safeguards R&D study with LANL...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{the safety of the}} direct {{disposal}} of spent fuel, the corrosion resistance of the waste form spent fuel, {{which is one of the}} technical barriers against the release of radionuclides, was investigated. <b>Decladded</b> pellets of high burnup LWR-UO_ 2 -fuel, but with the cladding beeing present, were exposed to MgCl_ 2 -rich solution. NaCl-solution and DI-water in the temperature range from 90 - 150 under dynamic conditions. The accumulated corrosion times were between 1000 and 1500 days, the intervals, when the leachates were changed, were 250 #+-# 50 days. The corrosion rates are highest, when using MgCl_ 2 -rich solutions and the pH is low (low pH-values were a result of the use of teflon liners, the addition of an acid indicator nuclide solution and N_ 2 -atmosphere). The enhanced corrosion of spent fuel, obtained at these conditions, allows to study the kinetic dissolution behavior of the matrix in a 'time-lapse-experiment'. After a corrosion time of three years, the disintegration of the fuel matrix, associated with increasing reaction rates were observed. Under neutral conditions (use of tantalum liners, no addition of acid indicator nuclide solutions) the release of radionuclides is around one or two orders of magnitude lower. If the reaction temperature is increased from 90 to 150 C the release of radionuclides was found to be 1 or 1, 5 orders of magnitude lower. This effect is more distinct at neutral pH, than observed at acid pH. Spent fuel samples, corroded in MgCl_ 2 -rich solution at 150 C at low pH as well as at high pH were characterized by means of ceramographic/metallographic methods (electron microprobe, optical and scanning electron microscopy). In both cases, a reaction layer of 2 - 3 #mu#m thickness, formed on the surface of the fuel was found. Main compounds of the layer were constituents of the brine, Mg, Cl and S. Especially MgCl_ 2, was formed under neutral conditions. At low pH MgSO_ 4 was formed mainly. (orig. /MM) Zur Bewertung der Sicherheit der Direkten Endlagerung wird die Korrosionsresistenz von abgebranntem Kernbrennstoff als innerster Barriere gegen eine moegliche Freisetzung von Radionukliden in MgCl_ 2 - reicher Salzloesung, NaCl-Loesung und reinem Wasser im Temperaturbereich zwischen 90 und 150 C unter dynamischen Bedingungen untersucht. Maximale Korrosionsraten werden in MgCl_ 2 -reichen Salzloesungen bei niedrigen pH-Werten erreicht (Ursachen: Verwendung von Tefloneinsaetzen, Zugabe saurer Leitnuklidloesung, N_ 2 -Atmosphaere). Die erhoehten Brennstoffumsaetze in kurzen Zeiten auf Grund der turnusmaessigen Loesungswechsel sowie der sauren Bedingungen ermoeglichen es, das kinetische Aufloesungsverhalten der Matrix quasi im 'Zeitrafferverfahren' zu untersuchen. Nach einer Korrosionszeit von ca. drei Jahren wird ein beginnender Abbau des Gefuegezusammenhalts, begleitet von zunehmenden Reaktionsraten, beobachtet. Unter neutralen Bedingungen dagegen werden um bis zu zwei Groessenordnungen geringere Freisetzungen von Radionukliden beobachtet. Eine Erhoehung der Korrosionstemperatur von 90 auf 150 C fuehrt nicht zu einer verstaerkten, sondern zu einer um bis zu 1, 5 Groessenordnungen verringerten Auslaugung. Dieser Effekt ist deutlicher bei neutralem als bei saurem pH-Wert. Korrodierte Brennstoffproben wurden mit festkoerperanalytischen Methoden (Mikrosonde, Licht- und Elektronenmikroskopie) im Hinblick auf die Bildung von sekundaeren Phasen sowie auf morphologische Veraenderungen untersucht. Erkennbar ist eine poroese etwa 2 - 3 #mu#m dicke Belegung der Probenoberflaeche, die im Kontakt mit der Loesung war. Hauptbestandteile der Schicht sind Komponenten der Auslaugloesung Mg, Cl und S, im wesentlichen MgCl_ 2 auf der Probe AL 23 (neutrale Bedingungen) und MgSO_ 4 auf der Probe AL 14 (saure Bedingungen).

40|$|The Zirflex Process {{employs a}} boiling aqueous {{solution}} of ammonium fluoride and ammonium nitrate to dissolve zirconium or Zircaloy. Average unoxidized Zircaloy dissolution rates are from 10 to 15 mils/hr for the optimum charge solution of 5. 5 M NH/sub 4 /F- 0. 5 M NH/sub 4 /NO/sub 3 / at a F/Zr mole ratio of 7. Zircaloy, which is oxidized {{by exposure to}} high-temperature air or water, dissolves at rates of threeto five-fold less. Cores of uranium, uranium- aluminum, and uranium dioxide are not severely attacked by the Zirflex <b>decladding</b> solutions. Only the soluble uranium enters the waste, with losses varying from 0. 3 to 3. 0 g/l. The Zirflex waste solution is neutralized to a pH of 10 before storage. This requires approximately 0. 07 gallon of 50 % caustic per gallon of <b>decladding</b> solution. The neutralized waste consists of nearly 20 vol. % of rapidly settling solids, which are easily slurried under turbulent flow conditions. These solids tend to settle out in streamline flow and therefore agitation is required during temporary storage. Conventional nitric acid core dissolution is generally applicable to Zircaloy-clad uranium and UO/sub 2 / elements since the core material is essentially free from zirconium. The addition of aluminum nitrate to the nitric acid dissolvent at an aluminum/ residual F/sup -/ mole ratio of approximately three is necessary, however, to ixhibit the corrosive action of residual fluoride. Stainless steel {{can be used as}} the material of construction for the Zirflex dissolver equipment because of the dissolvent&#x 27;s comparatively mild corrosive action. A corrosicn rate of 11 mils/month was determined using 304 L stainless steel exposed to boiling 6 M ammonium fluoride. (auth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProcess {{development}} {{studies are}} {{being done to}} recover and reuse zirconium from used nuclear fuel (UNF) zirconium alloy cladding. This {{has been shown to}} be economically viable and is a major initiative in waste reduction. The studies have included recovery processes based on dry pyrochemical iodination, chlorination, and hydrochlorination. Chlorination, using either or both chlorine and hydrogen chloride, was shown to provide better performance and is more compatible for interfacing with existing industrial chlorination processes used for fuel rod cladding manufacture from natural zirconium. The chlorination recovery process could be used for chemical <b>decladding</b> of intact UNF assemblies or for treatment of empty cladding segment hulls. Future work is planned to optimize recovery process conditions, equipment design, and scale-up operations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRepository {{programs}} {{throughout the}} world have been slowed by the need for increased local public involvement in the siting and licensing process. The result has been an increase in the dry storage of used fuel at reactor sites and the potential that such storage may be extended for many decades, even centuries. While there are sound technical reasons to believe that dry storage can be conducted safely, there are increasing concerns that the ultimate transfer to either a future repository or a centralized separations plant may result in fractured cladding and serious handling issues, including criticality concerns. These concerns would be increased for higher burn-up fuels. Currently, various chemical pre-treatment processes under R&D for application to commercial used oxide fuel have been investigated at the laboratory scale as methods to simplify and increase the safety of the remaining stages of conventional solvent extraction processing. This includes advanced <b>decladding</b> methods and various oxidation/reduction processes designed to release volatile and semi-volatile fission products, produce finely divided uranium oxide powder, and ameliorate the subsequent nitric acid dissolution step. The paper examines the potential for combining several chemical and physical pre-treatment steps to minimize long-term concerns about safe transport of used fuel, possibly providing another option for future nuclear waste management. Laboratory data from both cold and hot testing will provide the basis for the evaluation. An example of a potential pre-treatment process includes shearing, advanced voloxidation and off-gas treatment, the possible mixing of the resulting uranium oxide with a secondary oxide, and densification and recanning in nitric acid-soluble storage containers for extended time periods. Chemical <b>decladding</b> may be feasible to replace shearing. Zirconium recycle may also be feasible, significantly reducing high level waste quantities. Both analytic and experimental data will be applied to the examination of this potential fuel cycle option...|$|E
40|$|In {{one of the}} {{processes}} under development, the uranium and plutonium content of a spent reactor fuel of the Dresden type would be fluorinated in a fluid-bed reactor to produce the volatile uranium and plutonium hexafluorides. The study of the fluorination of U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / was undertaken {{because it is the}} major product obtained in an oxidative <b>decladding</b> step that is being proposed for the removal of uranium and plutonium from stainless steel-clad and Zircaloy- clad fuel elements. The study Will also provide data needed for the development of apparatus and procedures for future work with mixtures of uranosic oxide and plutoniam dioxide. Experiments were performed to determine the optimum reaction conditions for the conversion of U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / to uranium hexafluoride and for minimizing the elutriation of unreacted U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / from the fluid bed. Elutriation of U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / from the fluid bed was minimized when a fluid bed height of 8 in. of 120 mesh alumina, a fluorinating gas phase containing 20 vol% fluorine, and a reaction temperature of 500 deg C were employed. Conversion of greater than 99 % of the U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / to uranium hexafluoride was obtained when the feeding-fluorination period, in w,hich the U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 / powder was fed into the fluid bed and the major part of the fluorination was accomplished by reacting the oxide with 20 vol % fluorine, was followed by a recycle-fluorination period of 5 hr at 500 deg C with 100 % fluorine. Kinetic data for the fluorination of U/sub 3 /O/sub 8 /, obtained by means of a thermobalance, are reported for the temperature range from 300 to 400 deg C. The data were treated by the diminishing-sphere model. Experimental results are also presented for the oxidative <b>decladding</b> of stainless steelclad and Zircaloy-clad uranium dioxide pellets.

40|$|Used {{cladding}} hulls from {{pressurized water}} reactor (PWR) are characterized to provide useful information for the treatment and disposal of cladding hull wastes. The radioactivity and the mass of gamma emitting nuclides increases {{with an increase in}} the fuel burn-up and their removal ratios are found to be more than 99 wt. % except Co- 60 and Cs- 137. In the result of measuring the concentrations of U and Pu included in the cladding hull wastes, most of the residues are remained on the surface and the removal ratio of U and Pu are revealed to be over 99. 98 wt. % for the fuel burn-up of 35, 000 MWd/tU. An electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) line scanning shows that radioactive fission products are penetrated into the Zr oxide layer, which is proportional to the fuel burn-up.

40|$|Reprocessing of fuel {{elements}} receives much consideration in nuclear engineering. Chemical and electrochemical methods {{are used for}} the purpose. For difficultly soluble materials based on zirconium alloys chemical methods are not suitable. Chemical reprocessing of defective or irradiated {{fuel elements}} requires special methods for their <b>decladding</b> because {{the dissolution of the}} clad material in nitric acid is either impossible (stainless steel, Zr alloys) or quite slow (aluminium). Fuel elements are cut in air-tight glove-boxes equipped with a dust collector and a feeder for crushed material. Chemical treatment is not free from limitations. For this reason we started a study of the feasibility of electrochemical methods for reprocessing defective and irradiated fuel elements. A simplified electrochemical technology developed makes it possible to recover expensive materials which were earlier wasted or required multi-step treatment. The method and an electrochemical cell are suitable for essentially complete dissolution of any fuel elements, specifically those made of materials which are difficultly soluble by chemical methods...|$|E
