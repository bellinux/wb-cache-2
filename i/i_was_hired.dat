What those readers may not realize is that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hoffman {{was given}} his first leading role (despite joking {{at the time}} [...] "Even if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> into a leading-man part, I'd {{probably}} turn it into the non-leading-man part") in Todd Louiso's tragicomedy Love Liza (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years earlier, about a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, [...] "incredibly humble in its exploration of grief", but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the BBC wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed [...] "what he's truly capable of", but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000.|$|E
500|$|Burton hired Wesley Strick {{to do an}} uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> {{to write}} Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} Strick with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which I notice they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|E

500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired,</b> Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 Elliott, {{along with}} two [...] collaborators, Don Sebesky and Christofer Austin, won a Tony Award for his {{orchestration}} in the Broadway musical, An American in Paris. The production attracted attention because its direction and choreography were done by a ballet choreographer with no previous experience directing musicals. The production had already been performed in Paris for four months when Elliott was hired to adapt the music to better suit Broadway. [...] "I {{was brought in to}} re-do some of the songs in a more theatrical way," [...] Elliott said. In this process, the directors carefully study the audience responses during preview shows, then fine-tune the show based on what the director feels the audience responds to. Changes in a dance routine require the music for that dance to be re-written. Elliott used his same routine here that he used with film — [...] studying videos of the action. He worked on nearly half of the [...] music in the final show. He said, [...] "It is more than just taking notes and assigning them to a instrument, but rather bringing emotions to life that are trying to be there. He said, [...] "I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> to put the 'American' in An American in Paris." ...|$|E
