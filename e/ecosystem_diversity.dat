500|$|Biodiversity (an {{abbreviation}} of [...] "biological diversity") {{describes the}} diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, {{and there are many}} ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes species diversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity,</b> and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. Natural capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced. An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms, governments, and industry.|$|E

50|$|Diversity in the {{ecosystem}} is significant to human existence {{for a variety}} of reasons. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>diversity</b> boosts the availability of oxygen via the process of photosynthesis amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity In an aquatic environment helps in the purification of water by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and herbs for human use. A lack of diversity in {{the ecosystem}} produces an opposite result.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effects that changes in biodiversity will have on ecosystem functioning, it is important to define some terms. Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. This definition includes genetic diversity, or the diversity of genes within a species, species diversity, or the diversity of species within a habitat or region, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity,</b> or the diversity of habitats within a region.|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{abundance}} of species—especially those that influence water and nutrient dynamics, trophic interactions, or disturbance regime—affect the structure and functioning of <b>ecosystems.</b> <b>Diversity</b> is also functionally important, both because it increases the probability of including species that have strong ecosystem effects and because it can increase the efficiency of resource use. Differences in environmental sensitivity among functionally similar species give stability to ecosystem processes, whereas differences in sensitivity among functionally different species make ecosys-tems more vulnerable to change. Current global environmental changes that affect species composition and diversity are therefore profoundly altering {{the functioning of the}} biosphere. The two most dramatic ecological trends of the past century are human-induced changes in biotic diversity and alterations to the structure and functioning of ecosys-tems (1).

50|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{organized}} a global assortment {{of scientists and}} research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature {{in an effort to}} tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List. The IUCN Red List serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity. More than the dramatic rates of species loss, however, conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on rare, endemic or endangered species. Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity.</b> Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity.</b> While the conservation status of species is employed extensively in conservation management, some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.|$|E
50|$|Eutrophication, {{an influx}} of {{nutrients}} (phosphate/nitrate), often a byproduct of agricultural run-off and sewage discharge, can result in large but short-lived algae blooms. Upon a bloom’s conclusion, the dead algae sink {{to the bottom and}} are broken down until all oxygen is expended. Such a case is the Gulf of Mexico where a seasonal dead zone occurs, which can be disturbed by weather patterns such as hurricanes and tropical convection. Sewage discharge, specifically that of nutrient concentrated “sludge”, can be especially damaging to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity.</b> Species sensitive to anoxic conditions are replaced by fewer hardier species, reducing the overall variability of the affected area.|$|E

Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split up into various scales (e.g. <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity</b> vs. habitat diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat d.) or different subcategories (e.g. phylogenetic diversity, species diversity, genetic diversity, nucleotide diversity). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.|$|E

International {{treaties}} {{call for}} the protection of biodiversity in all its manifestations, including <b>ecosystem</b> and species <b>diversities.</b> The selection of most priority area networks focuses, however, pri-marily on species richness and occurrence. The effectiveness of this approach in capturing higher order manifestations of biodiversity, that is <b>ecosystem</b> and environmental <b>diversity</b> patterns, remains poorly understood. Using a case study of birds and environmental data from South Africa and Lesotho, we test how complementary networks that maximise species diversity perform with regard to their representation of <b>ecosystem</b> and environmental <b>diversity,</b> and vice versa. We compare these results to the performance of the existing reserve network. We conclude that focusing on any single biodiversity component alone is insufficient to protect other components.

5000|$|Surface {{mining and}} in-situ {{processing}} requires extensive land use. Mining, processing and waste disposal require land {{to be withdrawn}} from traditional uses, and therefore should avoid high density population areas. Oil shale mining reduces the original <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity</b> with habitats supporting a variety of plants and animals. After mining the land has to be reclaimed. However, this process takes time and cannot necessarily re-establish the original biodiversity. [...] The impact of sub-surface mining on the surroundings will be less than for open pit mines. However, sub-surface mining may also cause subsidence of the surface due {{to the collapse of}} mined-out area and abandoned stone drifts.|$|E

5000|$|The rapid {{decline of}} {{established}} biological systems {{around the world}} means that conservation biology {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "Discipline with a deadline". Conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the population ecology (dispersal, , demographics, effective population size, inbreeding depression, and minimum population viability) of rare or endangered species. Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity.</b> The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years, which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.|$|E
50|$|The late Devonian {{crash in}} {{biodiversity}} was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous: {{a recent survey}} (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22% of all the 'families' of marine animals (largely invertebrates) were eliminated. The family is a great unit, and to lose so many signifies a deep loss of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity.</b> On a smaller scale, 57% of genera and at least 75% of species did not survive into the Carboniferous. These latter estimates need {{to be treated with}} a degree of caution, as the estimates of species loss depend on surveys of Devonian marine taxa that are perhaps not well enough known to assess their true rate of losses, so it is difficult to estimate the effects of differential preservation and sampling biases during the Devonian.|$|E
50|$|Trinidad and Tobago are {{continental}} islands with a geologically {{very recent}} history of direct land bridge connection to South America. As a result, unlike most of the Caribbean Islands, Trinidad and Tobago supports a primarily South American flora and fauna and has greater diversity {{of plant and animal}} species than the Antilles. However, rates of endemism are lower than {{in the rest of the}} Caribbean because there has been less time for genetic isolation from mainland populations because of the history of land bridge connections and hence fewer opportunities for speciation, and so a greater proportion of the species in Trinidad and Tobago are also found on the South American mainland. Trinidad is nearer to mainland South America and has been directly connected to the mainland via land bridges more often and for longer periods than Tobago. This, as well as Trinidad's larger size and more varied topography and hydrology compared to that of Tobago allow greater species and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversity</b> on the former compared to that on the later of the islands.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{considerable}} efforts {{in recent years}} to modify fishing gears and practices to target particular sizes and species of fish and other marine organisms more efficiently, as well as to have less impact on bottom habitats. Recent developments in navigational aids and instruments for improving the classification of bottom habitats enables the fishing industry to harvest target resources more efficiently and to reduce impacts on benthic habitats and their communities. These changes hold promise for the achievement of broader ecosystem objectives, such as maintaining species and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>diversities.</b> This paper provides a review of successful developments and applications of selective fishing techniques that have been used to achieve ecosystem objectives. For example, the introduction of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in shrimp trawls has dramatically reduced mortality of endangered sea turtles; the declines of the by-catches and discards of finfish in many shrimp trawl fisheries has mainly been the result of the sorting grids and square mesh panels introduced in these fisheries...|$|R
