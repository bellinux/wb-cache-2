5|$|Whaam! is a 1963 diptych {{painting}} by the American artist Roy Lichtenstein. It {{is one of}} the best-known works of pop art, and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. Whaam! was first <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at Tate Modern since 2006.|$|E
5|$|When first <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 1828 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the {{painting}} attracted large crowds, and strongly divided critical opinion. It was greatly praised by many critics, who counted {{it among the}} finest works {{of art in the}} country. Other reviewers condemned it as crude, tasteless, offensive and poorly executed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E

5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Academy in 1830. Etty {{felt that the}} moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Composed of a torso, the Maxberg Specimen (S5) was {{discovered}} in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it {{was brought to the}} attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was <b>exhibited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell {{the painting}} to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E
