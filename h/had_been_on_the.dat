5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures than <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E

5|$|The film {{reestablished}} {{the career}} of Martin Ritt, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blacklist {{for most of the}} decade for alleged associations with communists. Paul Newman's performance as Ben Quick brought him national fame, as well as the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival. During the production, Newman married co-star Joanne Woodward.|$|E
5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock {{found himself in a}} {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, which he did not wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system.

Anyone who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last chance for them to redeem what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E

5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Further east, Trajan {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Dacia, an area north of Macedon and Greece and east of the Danube that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Roman agenda since before the days of Caesar when they had beaten a Roman army at the Battle of Histria. In 85 AD, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia and initially defeated an army the Emperor Domitian sent against them, but the Romans were victorious in the Battle of Tapae in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up.|$|E
5|$|In March the 49th (West Riding) Division (nicknamed The Polar Bears), who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nijmegen Island since November, {{came under}} the command of I Canadian Corps. On 2 April the division, {{supported}} by Canadian units, led Operation Destroyer to clear the Island, carefully timing the initial attack to coincide with II Corps' clearance of the east bank of the IJssel. On 3 April elements of I Corps crossed the Nederrijn east of the IJssel and met units from II Corps in the town of Westervoort opposite Arnhem. The rest of the Island was cleared within another day and the Allies occupied the southern bank of the Nederrijn in preparation for the assault on Arnhem.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{took his}} {{oath of office}} on May 29, but the court was in recess at the time. He took his seat when it {{returned}} to session on October 7. The court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time, averaging 40 cases per judge annually. The men on the court were close friends, and Minton developed a particularly close friendship with Judge J. Earl Major; Major offered Minton financial assistance during his later illnesses. Major <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> court {{for several years and}} held a judicial philosophy similar to Minton's. The two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other's homes.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{despite the}} unpopularity {{of some of}} his measures, Alexios's efforts had been vital to the {{survival}} of the empire. Financially and militarily bankrupt, and facing wave after wave of foreign invasion, the empire he inherited <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point of collapse. His long struggle to protect and restore the strength of the empire had been exhausting, but Alexios's successors inherited a viable state with both the internal stability and the military and financial resources, to expand in the future.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 1971, {{the bridge}} opened for traffic, {{and on the}} same day, the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry was terminated. In February 1972, there were twice as many cars as there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ferry in February 1971. The {{official}} opening by King Olav V took place on 25 May 1972. The bridge cost NOK39.8 million to construct. This included NOK650,000 for the county road between Knarrevik and Brattholmen, which had been {{paid for by the}} state. The cost the company had to pay was NOK23.45 million. The final estimates for the project were for NOK34 million, and the whole cost above this was covered by the state. When it opened, the bridge was the longest in Norway.|$|E

Before becoming a judge, Medina successfully argued the case of Cramer v. United States before the Supreme Court, defending a German-American charged with treason.|$|E
5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often {{erupted into}} gang warfare, and street {{violence}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rise in the}} reign of Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to restore order, when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD {{during the reign of}} Justinian, which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy Stead as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E
