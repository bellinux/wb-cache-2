500|$|At age 16, Cher {{dropped out}} of school, left her mother's house, and moved into Los Angeles with a friend. She took acting classes and worked to support herself, dancing in small clubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip and {{introducing}} herself to performers, managers, and agents. According to Berman, [...] " [...] {{did not hesitate to}} approach anyone she thought could help her <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> make a new contact, or get an audition." [...] Cher met performer Sonny Bono in November 1962 when he was working for record producer Phil Spector. Cher's friend moved out, and Cher accepted Sonny's offer to be his housekeeper. Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backup singer on many recordings, including the Ronettes' [...] "Be My Baby" [...] and the Righteous Brothers' [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'". Spector produced her first single, the commercially unsuccessful [...] "Ringo, I Love You", which Cher recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
500|$|Vikram next {{featured}} in Rajapattai (2011) alongside Deeksha Seth {{under the direction}} of Suseenthiran where he played a henchman trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in the Tamil film industry. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics in December 2011 and performed below expectations at the box office. Vikram also completed half of a fantasy period film during 2011, Karikalan in which he played Karikala Chola, a Tamil king who ruled in 270 BC, opposite Zarine Khan {{under the direction of}} graphics director Kannan, but the film was later shelved owing to production troubles. He then appeared in his second project with director Vijay, portraying the lead role of a blinded RAW agent in the action-thriller, Thaandavam. The film, which also featured Anushka Shetty, Amy Jackson and Lakshmi Rai in pivotal roles, opened to mixed reviews in September 2012. For his role of a blind man, Vikram trained under noted human echolocation specialist Daniel Kish, with the latter also playing a cameo in the film. A critic from Sify.com noted that it was [...] "Vikram and him alone who diverts your attention from the film's little logical script flaws and spellbinds you with an endearing act that is Thaandavam's biggest strength"; subsequently the film did average business commercially. The actor was next seen portraying the title role in Bejoy Nambiar's bilingual David, which released with different cast members in Hindi and Tamil. Vikram remained the only common lead actor in the versions, with his segment playing out a love story between a careless drunkard fisherman and a mute girl played by Isha Sherwani. While the Tamil version opened to predominantly positive review, the Hindi film also won mixed reviews, with both films performing average business at the box office.|$|E

2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
2500|$|The 1985 Wimbledon Championships final saw Evert play Navratilova for the fifth-time at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). [...] In {{the first}} set, Evert broke Navratilova {{in the third}} game of the set, which allowed her to go up on serve. [...] This {{would not be an}} {{uncomplicated}} set though for Evert because at five game to four with her serving for the match she had many complications. [...] Evert took the first point of the game on a volley that her opponent hit into the net. [...] Evert would find herself in a bind on break point in the first set, which Navratilova hit a backhand volley, but Evert reached it with a forehand shot. [...] Then she had to stave off another break point with a speedy forehand. [...] On the first set point, Evert misplayed a forehand to deep, and lost the point. [...] The second set point was played out by a weakly lobbed shot by Evert was tracked down by Navratilova, and her opponent played another lob back, which Evert played horridly overhead smash shot. [...] This was still barely strong enough to force a measger return by Navratilova, which Evert volley the ball into the corner to take the opening set six games to four. [...] In the second set, Evert could not get her playing level back from the first set. [...] Evert was at one-all love-30 on Navratilova's serve, but was unable to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> point off of her, which in the subsequent game her opponent would break her serve and the score line was one game to three instead of the other way around. [...] Evert now found herself at two games to four and love-30 down, and got lambasted by four Navratilova winners. [...] At five games to three, Evert had two break points, but could not convert, which Evert lost the second set three games to six. [...] In the decider set, Evert was quickly put on the defensive by Navratilova in the first game, which she was down 15 points to love. [...] At this juncture, Evert saved those two break point opportunities, but on deuce came to net and got passed, which set up a three-times-a-charm break point and her opponent capitalized on the opening. [...] Evert could not get back on track because of the relentless nature to Navratilova's game, which in the last game was plagued by bad line calls and lost the set two games to six. [...] In the end, Evert never won a final appearance at Wimbledon against her arch-enemy Navratilova in all five-time they pair played in them together.|$|E
