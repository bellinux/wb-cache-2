5|$|On the November 18 {{episode of}} Impact! James {{defeated}} Angelina Love {{to become the}} number one contender to the championship. At Final Resolution, James was defeated by Tara in a Falls Count Anywhere match, following interference from Madison Rayne after she sprayed a fire extinguisher and hit James with the Knockouts title belt. On the following episode of Impact!, James defeated Tara in a steel cage match. On January 9, 2011 at Genesis, James lost her match against Rayne for the Knockouts Championship due to interference from Tara. The following month at Against All Odds, James once again failed to win the Knockouts Championship, this time losing to Rayne in a Last Knockout Standing match, after another interference by Tara. On the March 17 episode of Impact!, Rayne agreed to give James another title match at Lockdown, with the added stipulation that should James fail to win the title, {{she would have to}} shave her hair off. On March 18, James legitimately separated <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> a TNA house show in Jacksonville, Florida. James's injury was put into a storyline, where it was caused by Rayne and Tara running over her with Tara's motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|He {{is perhaps}} best known for his portraits, and his sitters {{including}} {{some of the most important}} men and women of his time. His portrait of painter Lydia Field Emmet in 1892 depicts Emmet in a pose typically reserved for men in old masters' paintings. Emmet's hand is on her hip and she looks over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the audience.|$|E
500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.|$|E
60|$|The curtain {{came down}} upon the act, {{and he looked at}} the lady next him. She was shrugging <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband, whose face was healthy and offended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] ejaculated Elspie, {{springing}} up and drawing a shawl round <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time}} making some hasty and futile attempts to reduce the confusion of her hair.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pullet brushed each door-post {{with great}} nicety, about the {{latitude}} of <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> (<b>at</b> that period {{a woman was}} truly ridiculous to an instructed eye {{if she did not}} measure a yard and a half across the shoulders), and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlor where Mrs. Glegg was seated.|$|R
60|$|She laughed over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> me--the very {{incarnation}} of effrontery and insolence.|$|E
60|$|Meriem glanced lazily over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> {{the excited}} disturber of her peace.|$|E
60|$|Miss Howard {{shook hands}} with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> John.|$|E
50|$|She {{was forced}} to end her season prematurely after {{suffering}} a joint sprain in <b>her</b> right <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the Challenge Bell in September.|$|R
60|$|Clara shrugged <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{and looked}} <b>at</b> {{herself in a}} mirror.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Then {{governor}} general Michaëlle Jean {{wearing the}} Commander's insignia as a brooch, top on <b>her</b> left <b>shoulder,</b> <b>at</b> Remembrance Day ceremonies in Ottawa, 2007 ...|$|R
60|$|Arrived at {{the library}} door, Lady Janet looked over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the little {{immovable}} black figure in the chair.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} her lead, and I saw her glance back over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the young man, who seemed unaware, even, of her departure.|$|E
60|$|The dame de compagnie had {{advanced}} to the open hall-door. She glanced rapidly over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Miss Haldin, who remained within the hall.|$|E
6000|$|Then in {{the doorway}} she saw her husband. She had never, till to-day, quite hated him; but now she did, with a real blind horrible feeling. What did he want of her {{standing}} there with those eyes fixed on her--those forceful eyes, touched with blood, that seemed at once to threaten, covet, and beseech! She drew her wrapper close round <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>At</b> that he came up and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he stood}} with his hands on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> looking earnestly <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Even {{the most}} {{valuable}} and expensive pet may become a vexation if it is continually showing ill-temper and fractiousness. Mrs Monnerie merely puckered her lips or shrugged <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> my outbursts of vanity and insolence. But drops of water will wear away a stone. From being Court Favourite I gradually sank to being Court Fool. In sheer ennui and desperation I waggled my bells and brandished my bladder. A cat may look at a Queen, but it should, I am sure, make faces only at her Ladies-in-waiting.|$|R
6000|$|... "This weather {{makes me}} {{long for the}} country," [...] she said, looking over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the back view of tall houses through the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the great}} ruffen pushing me!" [...] screamed {{a woman in}} front of Jan over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him when the rush was at its fiercest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so. Lynde {{said she}} had seen you on the shore once. Well"--she cast an {{uncertain}} glance over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the house--"I'm much obliged to you." ...|$|E
50|$|Graziella title {{character}} was depicted by the French artist Jules Joseph Lefebvre in an 1878 oil painting on canvas. Commissioned by the art collector Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the work depicts Graziella {{sitting on a}} rock, fishing net in hand, gazing over <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> a smoking Mount Vesuvius. The painting {{is now at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York. Another painting, Graziella di Lamartine, was completed by Neapolitan artist Ferdinando Ruggieri, and a sculpture by Cesare Aureli depicting a scene where Graziella cuts her hair as a sacrifice to the Virgin Mary is also recorded.|$|R
60|$|The {{mother came}} in again, and the talk became general. Maggie flashed {{her eyes at}} me from time to time, complacent and satisfied, moving among the men. I paid her little compliments, which she {{did not seem to}} hear. She {{attended}} to me with a kind of sinister, witch-like gracious-ness, her dark head ducked between <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>at</b> once humble and powerful. She was happy as a child attending to her father-in-law and to me. But there was something ominous between her eyebrows, as if a dark moth were settled there--and something ominous in her bent, hulking bearing.|$|R
50|$|Eileen Joyce {{experienced}} considerable {{ill health}} throughout her adult years, particularly severe rheumatism in <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> which <b>at</b> one time necessitated a plaster cast, and sciatica. Towards {{the end of}} her life, she suffered from senile dementia. She died in 1991 at East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, Surrey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Regarde, regarde ces gens-la! Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux incroyables?' And {{with the}} words of French in her mouth, she would look over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the giggling party.|$|E
60|$|She did not {{certainly}} as she shook the popper laughingly, {{and looked over}} <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him, with the bloom of fire-light on her cheeks, its cheerfulness in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} my aunt's first dinner-gown very brightly, {{and how she}} stood before {{the fire in the}} drawing-room confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed, and looking over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> herself in a mirror.|$|E
6000|$|The old man {{placed his}} two hands on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{a moment with}} extreme benevolence and then gallantly kissed her. [...] "It's a great {{pleasure}} to me to see you here; but I wish you had given us a chance to receive you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Annabel {{accepted}} the book very graciously, and, {{in spite of}} all the temptations of her toys, Venetia could not refrain from peeping over <b>her</b> mother's <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> its contents. 'Mother,' she whispered, in a voice inaudible save to Lady Annabel, 'I may read this!' ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Markham, {{the precise}} student may remember, was the lady {{once known as}} the Venus of Milo to her young companions at St. Ursula's. Now mantles were draped on <b>her</b> stately <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> Madame Claudine's, and Logan and she were {{somewhat}} hopelessly attached to each other.|$|R
6000|$|Diving {{suddenly}} {{into the}} recesses of something, she produced an exiguous round silver box. Prizing it open, she looked over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the Bigwigs, then placed her little finger on {{the contents of the}} little box, and said very softly: ...|$|E
6000|$|As Clym {{descended into}} the valley Thomasin came down by the other path, and {{met him at the}} gate. [...] "What do you think I have to tell you, Clym?" [...] she said, looking archly over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
60|$|The {{green sun}} was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and {{the vision of}} the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round over <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> it, startled.|$|E
6000|$|... “Dear, dreary old place!” cries Beatrix. “Mamma hath {{never had}} the heart to go back thither since we left it, when—never mind how many years ago,” and she flung back her curls, and looked over <b>her</b> fair <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the mirror superbly, as if she said, “Time, I defy you.” ...|$|R
60|$|Ger. He {{spoke of}} that, and many a wonder more, Melting all hearts to worship--how a robe Which from <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>at</b> a royal feast, To some importunate as alms she sent, By miracle within her bower was hung again: And how {{on her own}} couch the Incarnate Son In {{likeness}} of a leprous serf, she laid: And many a wondrous tale till now unheard; Which, from her handmaid's oath and attestation, Siegfried of Maintz to far Perugia sent, And sainted Umbria's labyrinthine hills, Even to the holy Council, where the Patriarchs Of Antioch and Jerusalem, and with them A host of prelates, magnates, knights, and nobles, Decreed and canonised her sainthood's palm.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, Editha's {{face was}} pallid and drawn, and she {{stared into the}} fire with eyes which seemed aglow with anxiety and even with fear. Her cloak was tied loosely about <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and <b>at</b> sight of Sir Marmaduke she started, then rising hurriedly, she put her hood over her head, and went towards the door.|$|R
