5|$|Ytterbium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolYb and atomic number70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate {{element in the}} lanthanide series, which {{is the basis of}} the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from those of most other lanthanides.|$|E

Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts together to make a readable whole.|$|E

Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't <b>differ</b> <b>significantly,</b> McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the German invasion, the {{population}} of Jews {{was estimated to be}} about210,000, although according to data from the Lithuanian statistics department, as of 1 January 1941 there were 208,000 Jews. This estimate, based on the officially accounted for prewar emigration within the USSR (approx.8,500), the number of escapees from Kaunas and Vilnius Ghettos, (1,500-2,000), as well as the number of the survivors in the concentration camps when they were liberated by the Red Army, (2,000-3,000), puts the number of Lithuanian Jews murdered in the Holocaust at195,000to196,000. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of casualties of the Holocaust and the latter number cannot be final or indisputable. The numbers given by historians <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> ranging from 165,000to254,000, the higher number probably including non-Lithuanian Jews among other Reich (empirical) dissenters labeled as Jewish killed in Lithuania.|$|E

Insomniac believed that one of the key processes in the development process was the rigorous testing. Working closely with Sony and listening to fans of the Ratchet and Clank series, they gathered feedback and made improvements to the game. They felt that they had created a game that would appeal to a number of genres with the inclusion of elements of platform, action and side-scrolling gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 34 {{was first}} {{designated}} on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway {{began at the}} free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 {{to the point that}} is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.|$|E
