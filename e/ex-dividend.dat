25|$|When a security's <b>ex-{{dividend}}</b> date passes, {{the dividend}} is deducted from the shortholder's account and {{paid to the}} person from whom the stock is borrowed.|$|E
25|$|After a stock goes <b>ex-{{dividend}}</b> (i.e. when {{a dividend}} {{has just been}} paid, {{so there is no}} anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ex-dividend</b> date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the record date. This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.|$|E
2500|$|Record date — {{shareholders}} {{registered in}} the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend. [...] Shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date.|$|E
2500|$|In-{{dividend}} date — {{the last}} day, {{which is one}} trading day before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, where the stock {{is said to be}} cum dividend ('with [...] dividend'). In other words, existing holders of the stock and anyone who buys it on this day will receive the dividend, whereas any holders selling the stock lose their right to the dividend. [...] After this date the stock becomes ex dividend.|$|E
5000|$|... is the net {{present value}} of the {{dividends}} at the <b>ex-dividend</b> dates (we use the <b>ex-dividend</b> dates because on this date the stock price declines {{by the amount of}} the dividend) ...|$|E
50|$|If you {{purchase}} a stock on its <b>ex-dividend</b> date or after, {{you will not}} receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If {{you purchase}} before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, you get the dividend.|$|E
50|$|For special dividends, the <b>ex-dividend</b> date is set {{according}} {{to the size of}} the dividend in relation to the price of the security, and dividends or distributions of less than 25% are subject to the 'regular' rules for <b>ex-dividend</b> dates.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ex-dividend</b> date is two {{business}} {{days prior to}} the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date an investor must purchase the stock before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date. The latest date he can buy the stock to be a stockholder on record and be entitled to the dividend would be one day prior to the <b>ex-dividend</b> date (this includes extended hours (pre-market and after-hours) of that day) {{to allow for the}} three stock trading day settlement of the stock purchase. If the investor purchases the stock the day before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date the investor would be a stockholder on the record date and would be entitled to receive the dividend payment.|$|E
50|$|For shares {{listed on}} the London Stock Exchange, the <b>ex-dividend</b> date is usually one {{business}} day before the record date. The <b>ex-dividend</b> date is almost always on a Thursday with the associated record date on the next Friday. Exceptions to this timetable are usually special dividends, and dividends provided by overseas issuers who only have a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange. Prior to 9 October 2014 the <b>ex-dividend</b> date was usually two business days before the record date, i.e. typically Wednesdays.|$|E
50|$|An {{investor}} only {{needs to}} own the stock for one day (the record date) {{to be entitled to}} receive the dividend payment. If the investor buys before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, and sells on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date or after, the investor will receive the dividend payment.|$|E
50|$|Consider an American {{call option}} with <b>ex-dividend</b> dates in 3 months and 5 months, {{and has an}} {{expiration}} date of 6 months. The dividend on each <b>ex-dividend</b> date is expected to payout $0.70. Additional information is presented below. Find {{the value of the}} American call option.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{dividends}} or {{distributions of}} more than 25% are subject to 'special' rules for <b>ex-dividend</b> dates. The major difference here is that for these larger distributions or dividends, the <b>ex-dividend</b> date is set as the day after payment (with the day of payment being the [...] "payment date").|$|E
50|$|An {{investor}} {{who wishes to}} be entitled to the dividend does not have to wait until after the record date to sell the stock; however, the investor must hold the stock until the <b>ex-dividend</b> date. If the investor were to sell the stock on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date or afterwards, the investor would still be entitled to the dividend payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, the investor would be a stockholder on the record date. If the investor sells the stock on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the record date given the three stock business trading day settlement. The person that bought the stock would not be entitled to receive the dividend.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission {{stipulates}} the T+3 rule, {{that stock}} trades settle {{three days after}} purchase. The <b>ex-dividend</b> date is normally two business days (3 minus 1) before the record date. After September 5, 2017 the settlement period will be one day shorter. For the purpose of calculating an <b>ex-dividend</b> date, business days are days on which both the major stock exchanges and the banks in New York State are open. Thus Columbus Day and Veterans Day are trading days, but not business days for calculating an <b>ex-dividend</b> date, since they are legal holidays and banks are not open.|$|E
50|$|As is {{the case}} with all dividends, if you sell your stock prior to the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, within the due bill period, you {{relinquish}} your right to the dividend. The earliest you can sell your stock and still be entitled to the special dividend is the date the stock begins trading on an ex-distribution basis, or generally one day after the dividend payment date, on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the close}} of {{business}} {{on the day before}} the <b>ex-dividend</b> date and before the market opens on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, all open good-until-canceled limit, stop, and stop limit orders are automatically reduced by the amount of the dividend, except for orders that the customer indicated [...] "do not reduce." [...] This is done because the dividend payout will decrease the value of the company, as it comes directly from the company's reserves. At the market opening on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, the stock will trade at a lower price, adjusted for the amount of the dividend paid. If a corporation is distributing something other than a cash dividend, such as rights or warrants, then the relevant date is called an ex rights date, or ex warrants date, etc.|$|E
50|$|Dividend {{stripping}} is {{the practice}} of buying shares a short period before a dividend is declared, called cum-dividend, and then selling them when they go <b>ex-dividend,</b> when the previous owner is entitled to the dividend. On the day the company trades <b>ex-dividend,</b> theoretically the share price drops {{by the amount of}} the dividend. However, the experience is that quality companies tend to recover the value of the dividend within a matter of weeks, at which time they trade normally.|$|E
5000|$|For an American-style call option, early {{exercise}} {{is a possibility}} whenever the benefits of being long the underlier outweigh the cost of surrendering the option early. For instance, {{on the day before}} an <b>ex-dividend</b> date, it may make sense to exercise an equity call option early in order to collect the dividend. In general, equity call options should only be exercised early on the day before an <b>ex-dividend</b> date, and then only for deep in-the-money options.|$|E
5000|$|... meet {{holding period}} requirements: You must have held the stock {{for more than}} 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date. The <b>ex-dividend</b> date is the first date {{following}} the declaration of a dividend on which the buyer of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment. For calculation purposes, {{the number of days}} of ownership includes the day of disposition but not the day of acquisition.|$|E
50|$|When a security's <b>ex-{{dividend}}</b> date passes, {{the dividend}} is deducted from the shortholder's account and {{paid to the}} person from whom the stock is borrowed.|$|E
50|$|After a stock goes <b>ex-{{dividend}}</b> (i.e. when {{a dividend}} {{has just been}} paid, {{so there is no}} anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{entitled}} to a special dividend of less than 25% of the share price, {{you need to be}} a stockholder on the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date, your purchase would need to have been made a minimum of three business days prior to the record date, and you would still have to own it on that day. The <b>ex-dividend</b> date, i.e. the first date in which a new buyer of shares would not {{be entitled}} to the dividend, is two business days prior to the record date (see <b>ex-dividend</b> date for exceptions).|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{dividends}} may {{qualify for}} a lower rate. However, among other things, the stock must be owned for more than 60 days out of a 121-day period around the <b>ex-dividend</b> date.|$|E
50|$|If, for {{whatever}} reason, a share transfer {{prior to the}} <b>ex-dividend</b> date is not recorded on the register in time, the seller is obligated to repay the dividend to the buyer when he receives it.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} types of gaps, {{excluding}} the gap that {{occurs as a result}} of a stock going <b>ex-dividend.</b> Each type has its own distinctive implication so it is important to be able to distinguish between them.|$|E
50|$|Different tax {{circumstances}} of different investors is a factor. A tax advantage available to {{everyone would be}} expected to show up in the <b>ex-dividend</b> price fall. But an advantage available only to a limited set of investors might not.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of {{preferred}} stock, you must have held the stock more than 90 days during the 181-day period that begins 90 days before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date if the dividends are due to periods totaling more than 366 days ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{simplest}} terms, ownership on the [...] "record date" [...] usually, but {{not always}} (because of the case of large special dividends), determines who is entitled to a dividend. The <b>ex-dividend</b> date always identifies who is ultimately entitled to receive a dividend.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the IRS {{defines the}} <b>ex-dividend</b> date as [...] "The <b>ex-dividend</b> date {{is the first}} date {{following}} the declaration of a dividend on which the purchaser of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment." [...] The London Stock Exchange defines the term [...] "ex" [...] as [...] "when a stock or dividend is issued by a company it is based upon an 'on register' or 'record date'. However, to create {{a level playing field}} when shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange during this benefit period an 'ex' date is set. Before this 'ex' date if shares are sold the selling party will need to pass on the benefit or dividend to the buying party." ...|$|E
50|$|For an investor, {{dividend}} stripping provides dividend income, and a capital loss when the shares fall in value (in normal circumstances) on going <b>ex-dividend.</b> This may be profitable if income {{is greater than}} the loss, or if the tax treatment of the two gives an advantage.|$|E
50|$|Record date — {{shareholders}} {{registered in}} the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend. Shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the record}} date {{is not a}} {{business}} day, then counting begins from the most recent business day instead of the actual record date. For instance, if the record date is Sunday, then the <b>ex-dividend</b> date is the preceding Wednesday, not Thursday — assuming no intervening holidays.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a special {{dividend}} of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite different apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a [...] "due bill," [...] which denotes that (though the company will pay the dividend to your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date three business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the <b>ex-dividend</b> date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ex-dividend</b> date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the record date. This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the <b>ex-dividend</b> date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.|$|E
5000|$|Payment of Dividend: Payment of Dividend {{does not}} have direct impact on value of {{derivatives}} {{but it does have}} indirect impact through stock price. We know that if dividend is paid, stock goes <b>ex-dividend</b> therefore price of stock will go down which will result into increase in Put premium and decrease in Call premium.|$|E
