5|$|Shinkai was {{approached}} in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga, {{which was then}} done by Midori Motohashi. In April, Shinkai stated {{that he was not}} contributing to the adaptation, leaving the work entirely to the manga artist. However, he did express interest in seeing the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology {{tests are}} used to examine <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their {{chemical}} ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than <b>finished</b> <b>products,</b> but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> to obtain a less toxic label.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to show the {{possibility}} of using the methods of cluster analysis in classification of stocks of <b>finished</b> <b>products.</b> Cluster analysis creates groups (clusters) of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> according to similarity in demand i. e. customer requirements for each product. Manner stocks sorting of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> by clusters is described a practical example. The resultants clusters are incorporated into the draft layout of the distribution warehouse...|$|R

5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b> This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> is ivory-colored and {{has almost}} no scent. (Perfumes are never used in Nabulsi soap.) Before leaving the factory, the {{individual}} cubes which {{are to be}} sold locally are wrapped by hand in paper which is waxed on one side. Cubes which are destined for export are left unwrapped and usually dispatched in stiff sacks {{to protect them from}} damage.|$|E
40|$|A {{supply chain}} {{can be defined}} as a network of {{facilities}} and distribution options that performs the functions of procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and <b>finished</b> <b>products,</b> and the distribution of these <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> to customers. Different entities in a supply chain operate subject to different sets of constraint...|$|R
30|$|To this end, {{we define}} the {{tripartite}} valued graph whose nodes are partitioned into three different independent sets, U, M, and D, such that no two endpoints of a link {{belong to the}} same set, nor one to set U and the other to set D. The first set U refers to the population of exporters of intermediate inputs. The second set M refers to the population of countries that are importers of intermediate products or exporters of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> or both importers of intermediate products and exporters of <b>finished</b> <b>products.</b> Finally, the third set D includes the importers of <b>finished</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
5|$|Van Morrison {{continued}} to record and {{tour in the}} 2000s, often performing {{two or three times}} a week. He formed his own independent label, Exile Productions Ltd, which enables him to maintain full production control of each album he records, which he then delivers as a <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> to the recording label that he chooses, for marketing and distribution.|$|E
5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore {{the brunt of}} the game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and stating that the difference between the developer's vision for the game mode and the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E

5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{mandatory}} COOL policy {{applied in}} the importing country of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> will also affect {{the economy of the}} producing country of primary materials. Because of the reduction of exports to the manufacturing country, it may invite some manufacturers to invest in the production of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> and export primary materials to the importing country for its national output.|$|R

5|$|From {{the trade}} {{overseas}} and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from Samarkand, date palms, pistachios, and figs from Greater Iran, pine nuts and ginseng roots from Korea and mangoes from Southeast Asia. In China, {{there was a}} great demand for sugar; during the reign of Harsha over North India (r. 606–647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate sugarcane. Cotton also came from India as a <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> from Bengal, although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{published}} Shelley at Oxford, {{an account}} of his memories of Shelley in The New Monthly Magazine in 1833. The article was heavily edited after its submission, which irritated him greatly. The editing was effective however, and many reviewers were very impressed by the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b> He also contributed articles to the Edinburgh Review. One notable article was {{a review of the}} first volume of Barthold Georg Niebuhr's Römische Geschichte. The editor of the Edinburgh Review, Macvey Napier, chose another writer to review the second volume, which infuriated Hogg.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E

5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's personal experiences with, and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism. The work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility, but even Kurosawa regarded the <b>finished</b> <b>product</b> as dramatically unfocused and unsatisfactory, and almost all critics agree. However, it would be Kurosawa's second film of 1950, Rashomon, that would ultimately win him, and Japanese cinema, a whole new international audience.|$|E
5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b> Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the metal}} {{used for the}} gandingan was bronze but due to its {{scarcity}} after WWII, gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets. Recently, galvanized steel sheets {{have been used by}} Maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of the gong (the knob, body and rim) would be made from separate sheets and welded together, then ground out to produce a <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b> Comparatively, these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times.|$|E
