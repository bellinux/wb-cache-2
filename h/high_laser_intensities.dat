40|$|Nonlinear {{saturation}} {{effects in}} ultrafast time-resolved rotational anisotropy measurements are explored {{as a function}} of increased pump <b>laser</b> <b>intensity.</b> Femtosecond pump-probe experimental data were obtained over 3 orders of magnitude in pump <b>laser</b> <b>intensity</b> ranging from no saturation to highly nonlinear saturation. Data were obtained for molecular iodine vapor at room temperature following resonant excitation of the BrX transition. For low pump <b>laser</b> <b>intensities,</b> the data are shown to fit the conventional anisotropy formalism for unidirectional detection well. For <b>higher</b> pump <b>laser</b> <b>intensities,</b> the overall anisotropy diminishes because of saturation and the conventional fits diverge from the experimental data. In this regime, a saturation parameter can be introduced in the formulation to improve the fit between the model and the experimental data, thereby improving the accuracy of the resulting rotational temperatures. At the <b>highest</b> <b>laser</b> <b>intensities,</b> an additional photochemical pathway arising from the ArX transition is observed. Incorporation of this pathway into the nonlinear rotational anisotropy model yields accurate rotational populations even for the <b>highest</b> <b>laser</b> <b>intensities.</b> Applications of this nonlinear anisotropy model to reactive and nonreactive ultrafast studies in order to extract quantitative information are discussed.

Consequently, the dependency of absorption saturation on the Doppler frequency was considered. The predicted variation in broadening width with <b>laser</b> <b>intensity</b> showed a good agreement with the measurement.

Results of general application enable comparisons to be drawn between the results for two limits of the input laser intensity.

Nonperturbative solution of the problem yields analytical expressions for PA linewidth and shift which are applicable for arbitrary PA laser intensity and magnetic field tuning of Feshbach Resonance.

40|$|The {{radiation}} pressure acceleration regime of laser ion acceleration requires <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>laser</b> pulses to function efficiently. Moreover the foil should be opaque for incident radiation during the interaction to ensure maximum momentum transfer from the pulse to the foil, which requires proper matching {{of the target}} to the laser pulse. However, in the ultrarelativistic regime, this leads to large acceleration distances, over which the <b>high</b> <b>laser</b> <b>intensity</b> for a Gaussian laser pulse must be maintained.

However, {{the surfaces of}} the selective laser melted parts exhibit for many applications an insufficient high roughness, thus require subsequent post processing steps. A relatively new {{way to reduce the}} surface roughness is the laser polishing technique. In the present paper, additively manufactured AlSi 10 Mg samples were polished with different <b>laser</b> <b>intensities</b> and <b>laser</b> modes. The investigations contain the potential of roughness reduction and enhancement of the surface appearances, which can be achieved by laser polishing of the as-built surfaces. An initial arithmetic mean roughness of 8. 43 μm was remarkably reduced up to 98 %. The compositions of the polished surfaces were detected and the surface appearances were examined.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} humidity on the MAPbI 3 MWs spontaneous emission, PL spectroscopy was performed along 11  weeks. Because of the inhomogeneity in the MWs (see Additional file  1 : Figure S 2), we measured ten different MWs (nine MWs the last week) chosen randomly each week, thus obtaining a general view about {{the response of the}} spontaneous emission at different stages of moisture exposure. In the first 4  weeks, the RH in the sample storage place was the same as the local weather conditions, being 45  ±  5 % in the first 3  weeks and rising to 55  ±  5 % in the fourth week. Then, from the fifth to the 11 th week, the RH of 80  ±  2 % was controlled with a salt-saturated solution (as described in the “Experimental” section). PL measurements were carried out with a red laser (λ =[*] 633  nm) and at low excitation power (~[*] 5  μW) {{in order to avoid the}} local heating and damage of the MWs by <b>high</b> <b>laser</b> <b>intensities.</b> The degradation by <b>high</b> <b>laser</b> <b>intensities</b> has been observed in polycrystalline MAPbI 3 films [28, 29], which is mainly due to the low thermal conductivity of MAPbI 3 [30]. Moreover, short acquisition time (10  s) was used to reduce the sample exposure to the laser light to avoid thermal decomposition and to minimize light soaking (defects curing effect) by trap filling from photogenerated free-charge carriers and O 2, which could reduce the nonradiative recombination channels and increases the PL intensity [10]. This material healing phenomenon could hide the surface and bulk defects that humidity may cause in the material.|$|E
