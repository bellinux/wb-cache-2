40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{epidemic}} of Ebola between years 2014 and 2015 and response of the Czech Republic. The main objective of the thesis is to assess the strategy of the Czech Republic in order to eliminate import of Ebola. The thesis is using study of documents and its effort is a complex overview of the given matters. Used documents are especially information and reports of international and Czech organizations, regulations, expert articles, electronic inquiries and media reports. There was defined 5 research questions. First question {{is focused on}} the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic in West Africa. Second question was analysing steps, which were performed within the system of preparedness for highly contagious infections in the Czech Republic. I have divided the whole strategy of the Czech Republic into 10 points. They consist of the enforcing of <b>International</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Regulation</b> (2005), Decision no. 1082 / 2013 /EU of the EP and of the Council, National action plan for the case of event, which is subject to <b>International</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Regulation</b> and two directives, implementation of special measures on international airports, conclusion of cooperation agreements, transmission of information within the Czech Republic, simulation actions and humanitarian aid. Third question was analysing the respondence of arrival cards at the Václav Havel Airport in Prague. Respondence was approx. 40 %. (Jágrová, 2016 a) Fourth question is assessing the efficiency of implemented measures using the recorded cases of suspicion. Although there was not any case of infection in the Czech Republic, it may be concluded, that implemented measures are efficient. Fifth question {{is focused on the}} assessment of implemented measures and suggestions, how the response of the Czech Republic may be improved. Preparedness of the Czech Republic was assessed as very good by experts. Also it may be concluded from results, that preparedness is sufficient. Suggested measures, how the response of the Czech Republic may be improved, are related to the system of rapid alert of the public, creation of team for humanitarian aid, maintaining of sufficient capacities and realization of simulation actions...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System (PSSS), {{launched}} in 2010, provides a simple {{mechanism by which}} 121 sentinel surveillance sites in 21 Pacific island countries and areas perform routine indicator- and event-based surveillance for the early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. This evaluation aims to assess whether the PSSS is meeting its objectives, what {{progress has been made}} since a formative evaluation of the system was conducted in 2011, and provides recommendations to enhance the PSSS's performance in the future. Methods: Twenty-one informant interviews were conducted with national operators of the system and regional public health agencies that use information generated by it. Historic PSSS data were analysed to assess timeliness and completeness of reporting. Results: The system is simple, acceptable and useful for public health decision-makers. The PSSS has greatly enhanced Pacific island countries' ability to undertake early warning surveillance and has contributed to efforts to meet national surveillance-related <b>International</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Regulation</b> (2005) capacity development obligations. Despite this, issues with timeliness and completeness of reporting, data quality and system stability persist. Conclusion: A balance between maintaining the system's simplicity and technical advances will need to be found to ensure its long-term sustainability, given the low-resource context for which it is designed...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have {{introduced}} normative and cognitive changes {{in response to}} the challenge of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). These changes {{take the form of a}} paradigm shift from 'an international management of threats' towards 'a global governance of risks'. The distinction between these two paradigms is developed in this paper based on literature on public health policy and on risk sociology. Here, we suggest that risks differ from threats (or classical risks) by being uncertain, global and anticipated catastrophes. They require an alternative paradigm of risk governance based on precaution, transparency and participation. To demonstrate empirically this shift, the paper analysed the WHO and OIE's response to recent EIDs, and in particular bird flu (H 5 N 1). With H 5 N 1, these organisations have shown an unprecedented ambition to handle a 'prepandemic' virus; they have called for increased transparency from Member States on their epidemiologic status, and for the inclusion of a wider range of stakeholders into the task of epidemiologic surveillance. This paper shows that the WHO and the OIE framed EIDs as modern risks and handled them using the 'global risks governance' paradigm. In doing so, they seized the opportunity, in a competitive way, to legitimise a wider scope of intervention for themselves by revising their regulatory tools (the <b>International</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Regulation</b> and the Terrestrial Animal Health Code) and by extending the obligations of the Member States via their system of notifiable events. This shift raises the issue of the instrumentalisation of the paradigm of global risk governance. It questions States' sovereignty, and stakeholder's participation and it highlights the political potential of modern risks, the link with the production of knowledge and the activity of surveillance in a world at risk.
