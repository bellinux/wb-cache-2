50|$|A <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hive</b> is a hive {{in which}} the combs cannot be removed or {{manipulated}} for management or harvesting without permanently damaging the comb. Almost any hollow structure {{can be used for}} this purpose, such as a log gum, skep, wooden box, or a clay pot or tube. <b>Fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> are no longer in common use in industrialized countries, and are illegal in places that require movable combs to inspect for problems such as varroa and American foulbrood.In many developing countries <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> are widely used and, because they can be made from any locally available material, are very inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|Beekeeping using <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> is an {{essential}} part of the livelihoods of many communities in poor countries. The charity Bees for Development recognizes that local skills to manage bees in <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> are widespread in Africa, Asia, and South America. Internal size of <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> range from 32.7 liters (2000 cubic inches) typical of the clay tube hives used in Egypt to 282 liters (17209 cubic inches) for the Perone hive. Straw skeps, bee gums, and unframed box hives are unlawful in most US states, as the comb and brood cannot be inspected for diseases. However, skeps are still used for collecting swarms by hobbyists in the UK, before moving them into standard hives. Quinby used box hives to produce so much honey that he saturated the New York market in the 1860s. His writings contain excellent advice for management of bees in <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the tree}} is cut down and the trunk section {{containing}} the colony is removed, {{the result is a}} log gum or gum hive. A log gum is essentially a bee tree cut into a short section that contained a colony of honey bees. It got its name from the fact that when gum trees die they rot from the inside out, thereby creating a large cavity in which bees would commonly nest. These <b>hives</b> are <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> and, therefore, medicating and inspecting is almost impossible.|$|R
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. <b>Fixed</b> <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|R
40|$|In recognition, discriminators use sensory {{information}} to make decisions. For example, honeybee (Apis mellifera) entrance guards discriminate between nest-mates and intruders by comparing their odours with a template of the colony odour. Comb wax {{plays a major role}} in honeybee recognition. We measured the rejection rates of nest-mate and non-nest-mate worker bees by entrance guards before and after a unidirectional transfer of wax comb from a `comb donor¿ hive to a `comb receiver¿ hive. Our results showed a significant effect that occurred in one direction. Guards in the <b>comb</b> receiver <b>hive</b> became more accepting of non-nest-mates from the <b>comb</b> donor <b>hive</b> (rejection decreased from 70 to 47 %); however, guards in the <b>comb</b> donor <b>hive</b> did not become more accepting of bees from the <b>comb</b> receiver <b>hive.</b> These data strongly support the hypothesis that the transfer of wax comb increases the acceptance of non-nest-mates not by changing the odour of the bees, but by changing the template used by guards...|$|R
5000|$|Langstroth's {{design for}} movable <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> was seized upon by apiarists and inventors {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic and a wide range of {{moveable}} <b>comb</b> <b>hives</b> were designed and perfected in England, France, Germany and the United States. Classic designs evolved in each country: Dadant hives and Langstroth hives are still dominant in the USA; in France the De-Layens trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the USA and also in many parts of Europe, though Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.|$|R
40|$|CMOS-compatible process {{carried out}} on SOI wafers, we have built {{high-performance}} torsional microscanners having vertically offset interdigitated-comb actuators. Our microscanner-fabrication process requires three photolithography masks: two to form the front-side microscanner structures and a third to define the backside openings. Both moving and <b>fixed</b> <b>combs</b> are fabricated in the same device layer (30 µm in thickness), and the offset combs are created by reducing {{the thickness of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>combs,</b> but not that of the moving combs. Our process begins by removing the 1 -µm thick thermal oxide selectively to open rectangular windows at locations where the <b>fixed</b> <b>combs</b> are to be defined. In the following step, both fixed- and moving-comb sets are defined simultaneously with a single photolithography mask; this is followed by deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE). We then perform a tuned-etch in the DRIE-etcher to obtain the desired vertical thickness for the <b>fixed</b> <b>combs</b> without affecting the moving combs. The minimum gap between comb fingers can be as small as twice the alignment accuracy of the photolithography process, which is ≤ 0. 4 µm for state-of-the-art photolithography steppers.

50|$|The 19th century {{saw this}} {{revolution}} in beekeeping practice completed through {{the perfection of}} the movable <b>comb</b> <b>hive</b> by the American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. Langstroth {{was the first person}} to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called the bee space, which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8 mm, or 1/4 to 3/8"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that combs containing honey could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the comb. The emptied honey combs could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling. Langstroth's book, The Hive and Honey-bee, published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable <b>comb</b> <b>hive.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most popular}} method of {{harvesting}} honey from a top-bar hive is by cutting the comb from the top-bar, crushing the comb and straining the honey. This results in honey {{with a higher}} pollen content than honey that is extracted by flinging out without crushing the <b>comb.</b> Top-bar <b>hive</b> <b>comb</b> can be extracted by flinging motion, e.g. in a hobbyist or commercial rotary extractor, {{but it can be}} problematic, because (a) if no foundation was used, the comb will break more easily during rotary movement, (b) top-bar <b>hives</b> <b>combs</b> have irregular or non-standard sizes that do not fit into commercially available extractors, (c) if the comb is not uniformly flat, {{it may be difficult to}} uncap the cells, which is required for rotary extraction, and (d) not all rotary extractors have cages or mesh to prevent loose pieces of comb from falling into the drum.|$|R
50|$|His {{technique}} for introducing new queen bees to an existing hive {{was published in}} 1874. New queens are usually rejected by an existing hive.

The bees being stressed by foreign imprisonment are unconcerned about the new queen. The old hive is left queenless and is also closed.

Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} clarify the economic viability of investment in meliponiculture in the current market price by engineering economic perspective. Investment in meliponiculture was analysed using Equivalent Annual Uniform Cost (EAUC), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Breakeven Analysis. A small start-up with 30 units of logs or hives was considered in the analysis. All raw data was acquainted from current Malaysian market price, but only revenue from honey was considered. It was found that EAUC indicated that the annual worth of the log system is 23 % better than the <b>hive</b> <b>system.</b> However, IRR calculation indicated that both the log and the <b>hive</b> <b>systems</b> offer margin exceeding 55 % which is a very good return in general investment. In addition, it was also found that the log system had breakeven after 8 th month, whereas the hive was 13 th month. Better economic value could be obtained if revenue from by-products are considered. Thus, it can be concluded that meliponiculture is still very economically viable in Malaysia market trend, and the <b>hive</b> <b>systems</b> could be a better choice if splitting colony, maintenance, safety and aesthetics points of view are considered...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} a variable angular vertical comb-drive (AVC) actuated MEMS scanning micromirror, focusing {{on the influence of}} the initial comb offset on the dynamic scan characteristics. Continuous control of the <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> initial vertical offset is achieved using an electrothermal actuator integrated in the AVC. Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations and experiments of the AVC structure show good agreement, with the initial vertical offset of the <b>fixed</b> <b>comb</b> reducing theoretically from 10. 8 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 6. 0 μm (500 mW to actuator) and experimentally from 10. 4 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 4. 9 μm (510 mW to actuator). Experimentally, a change of the initial vertical comb-offset from 10. 4 μm to 4. 9 μm leads to a reduction of the measured dynamic total optical scan angle (TOSA) from 27 ° to 19 ° for 100 V ac actuation. In addition, a mechanically assisted deflection of the AVC actuators to achieve an almost in-plane comb configuration further reduces the measured dynamic TOSA to about 3 °. The overall device behavior is modeled using a hybrid simulation approach combining FEM analysis of the AVC capacitance with an analytical solution of the motion equation of the scanner. The analysis show good agreement, with the experimentally measured characteristics; overall showing an increased TOSA with higher initial comb offsets...|$|R
50|$|The Feminine Monarchie, {{originally}} published by Joseph Barnes, Oxford, in 1609, {{is the first}} full-length English-language book about beekeeping.

It was translated into Latin in 1678 and 1682, then from Latin back to English again in 1704. The title expresses Butler's main idea that the colony is governed, not by a king-bee, as Aristotle claimed, but by a queen-bee. The last edition written by Butler contains ten chapters, including sections regarding bee gardens, hive-making materials, swarm catching, enemies of bees, feeding bees, {{and the benefits of}} bees to fruit (pollination). The book gives an excellent account of skep beekeeping, including methods of predicting - from tone pitch of the buzzing bees - when swarming might occur. Butler even transliterated the tones and included them on a musical score in the book. He further suggested that musicians may trace the roots of music back to the sounds of the hive.|$|R
