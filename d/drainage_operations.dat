40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the effect {{and safety of}} combined surgery with scleral buckling and <b>drainage</b> <b>operation</b> {{in the treatment of}} rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. METHODS: Totally 88 patients(88 eyes) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment accepted in our hospital from January 2009 to January 2013 were selected as study objects. All patients were given scleral operation and divided into two groups according to the operation mode. Patients in group A(44 eyes of 44 cases) were treated with combined surgery with scleral buckling and nondrainage operation, while patients in group B(44 eyes of 44 cases) were given combined surgery with scleral buckling and <b>drainage</b> <b>operation.</b> The retinal reattachment rate, postoperative visual acuity and complications between groups were compared after treatment. RESULTS:The anatomic reduction rates of eyes in group A and B were respectively 93 % and 89 %, with no significant differences between groups(P > 0. 05). There were 37 eyes(84 %) improved in eyesight after operation in group A, only 34 eyes(77 %) in group B. And visual acuity recovery rate of group A was evidently higher than that of group B, with significant differences between them(P vs 32 %, P CONCLUSION: It is efficient and secure for combined surgery with scleral buckling and <b>drainage</b> <b>operation</b> to treat patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, which is worthy of clinical application...|$|R

50|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of this century Scotstown Moor {{suffered}} some habitat degradation, largely due to <b>drainage</b> <b>operations.</b> However, the Second World War brought major problems for the site. The need for increased agricultural output led to the reclamation of part of the site, which was then put under intensive cattle grazing. This probably resulted in extensive areas of heather being replaced by grassland. The overall effect has led to fragmentation of the site, particularly serious for the bogs which became more and more isolated, and therefore vulnerable to external influences.|$|E

50|$|In 1791, {{he moved}} to London and set up his own {{engineering}} business, having by then begun to expand into civil engineering, particularly the construction of canals. His early projects included the Lancaster Canal (started 1792), the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation (1793), the Crinan Canal (1794-1801), Rudyard Lake (1797) and the Rochdale Canal, which passes through difficult country between Rochdale and Todmorden (1799). The Kennet and Avon Canal including the Dundas Aqueduct, Caen Hill Locks and Crofton Pumping Station occupied him between 1794 and 1810. In 1802 he revised {{the plans for the}} Royal Canal of Ireland from Dublin to the Shannon near Longford. For many years he was engaged in extensive <b>drainage</b> <b>operations</b> in the Lincolnshire and Norfolk fens (1802-1810), and in the improvement of the River Witham. The Eau Brink Cut, a new channel for the River Ouse, was completed just before his death.|$|E
50|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that undercutting of limestone can result from solution in soil that abuts rock, and measurements of soil water at the six sites showed that it is ‘acidic’ (pH below 7) with a pH range from 5.3 to 6.8. It has been noted that the Irish landscape has been profoundly altered by <b>drainage</b> <b>operations,</b> that signs of peat cutting are common in the Burren fens and that extensive deforestation has occurred in Ireland, {{all of which can}} lead to a lowering of the land surface. For instance, the ground in Holme Fen, England, subsided by 1.8m in the first decade after its initial drainage in 1851, a figure that is typical of initial peat subsidence rates. Accordingly, it is proposed that the wavestones at the six sites were undercut by soil water when soil levels were higher than today. It follows, therefore, that the studied wavestones are not, in fact, ‘wavestones'. More accurately, they are mushroom rocks that have formed in a terrestrial setting.|$|E

40|$|Loss {{of visual}} field subserving macular {{function}} {{has been found}} to be rare after intraocular surgery in advanced glaucoma. Abrupt changes in refractive error, lens opacity, and suppression must be carefully excluded before macular fixation is deemed lost. Out of 69 intraocular procedures (46 <b>drainage</b> <b>operations,</b> 13 cataract extractons) two patients lost central visual field subserving macular fixation possibly as a result of surgery. There is an increased incidence of postoperative maculopathy in late glaucoma. Three <b>drainage</b> <b>operations</b> out of 46 and four cataract extractions out of 13 had this complication. Altogether 30 % of drainage procedures induced deterioration of visual acuity of lenticular origin to a level normally requiring cataract extraction. Trabeculectomy was found to be less likely to cause this sequela than the Scheie procedure at the 6 month postoperative stage. However, 77 % of patients with advanced glaucoma and cataract obtained a satisfactory improvement in visual status after cataract extraction...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Pancreatic pseudocysts of type II are postnecrotic cysts {{that appear}} during an acute-on-chronic pancreatitis. In case that {{surgical}} treatment is necessary, {{as a rule}} it is performed using internal <b>drainage</b> <b>operations.</b> Pancreatic resections are rarely indicated. Case Outline. The authors present a 34 year-old man with a long-lasting history of moderate alcohol consumption in whom an episode of drinking caused an acute-on-chronic pancreatitis so that a 7 cm in diameter cyst was developed inside {{the tail of the}} pancreas causing left subcostal pain, mild pleural effusion and pain in the left shoulder. At operation almost entirely inside the tail of the pancreas a cyst of type II unsuitable for internal drainage operation was found so that a spared resection of the tail of the pancreas and splenectomy were carried out. The post-operative recovery was prolonged due to recurrent left pleural effusion requiring punctions, mild suppurative secretion from the splenic fossa and transient postsplenectomy thrombocytosis. Six months after surgery the patient is in good condition and with normal findings. Conclusion. Although rare, pancreatic cysts of type II may be unsuitable for internal <b>drainage</b> <b>operations</b> so that resection of the effected part of the pancreas could be a much better solution than external drainage...|$|E

40|$|Drainage {{operation}} {{is the most}} frequent surgical method of glaucoma treatment. The aim {{of the study was}} to compile an advisable database (DB) program for valuation of the effect of <b>drainage</b> <b>operations</b> and retrospectively to analyze the results of trabeculectomy. In the Eye Clinic of the Teaching Hospital in Hradec Kralove (CZ) we have compiled a special DB program in MS Access 2000 of Microsoft. Results of 1073 cases of trabeculectomies performed from 1990 to 2000 in this workplace have been prospectively and retrospectively enlisted in the DB. We have performed a statistical analysis of the trabeculectomies loaded in the DB, which were realized as the first surgical procedure on a watched eye without an application of antimetabolits and cytostatics with the monitoring periods of 1 - 10 years. The basic valuation criteria were the changes in intraocular pressure, visual acuity and after-surgical medication. After the operations we found impressive decrease in an average number of hypotensive medications. This DB program appears to be an effective tool for valuation of <b>drainage</b> <b>operations.</b> Trabeculectomy is a basic and relatively simple technique with a wide spectrum of indications and relatively low number of complications.

40|$|Exocrine and {{endocrine}} {{function of}} the pancreas was assessed in the early postoperative period (p > 0. 10). Endocrine function was initially spared after proximal pancreatectomy, but six additional patients (16 %, p < 0. 05) required treatment for diabetes at a mean of 19 months (range, 3 to 34). Deterioration in pancreatic function is thus not an invariable immediate consequence of pancreatic drainage procedures or partial pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis. Progression of disease must account, in part, for failure of both exocrine and endocrine function on long-term follow-up. <b>Drainage</b> <b>operations</b> appear to delay this progressive decline in pancreatic function...|$|E

40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT Attention {{is drawn}} to the {{considerable}} gastric stasis which is associated with vagotomy plus <b>drainage</b> <b>operations.</b> Alteration {{in the rate of}} gastric emptying has long been considered responsible for many of the sequelae of gastric surgery. For example, rapid gastric emptying after gastroenterostomy (Hertz, 1913; Mix, 1922) or Polya gastrectomy (Johnson, 1954; Abbott, Krieger, and Levey, 1958) can cause one type of 'dumping syndrome'. Delayed post-gast-rectomy emptying may also cause problems (Snell, 1937; Hosford, 1949). Dragstedt treated duodenal ulcers with vagotomy, but the resulting gastric stasis was associated with a high incidence of gastric ulceration (Dragstedt, Camp, and Fritz, 1949). It was this observation that led them to believe that almost all gastric ulcers were caused by antral overactivity associated with gastric stasis. Several workers have studied gastric emptying in the early post-operative period using either radio...|$|E
