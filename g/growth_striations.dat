50|$|The terms used by mineralogists {{to report}} crystal habits {{describe}} the typical appearance {{of an ideal}} mineral. Recognizing the habit can aid in identification as some habits are characteristic. Most minerals, however, do not display ideal habits due to conditions during crystallization. Euhedral crystals formed in uncrowded conditions with no adjacent crystal grains are not common; more often faces are poorly formed or unformed against adjacent grains and the mineral's habit may not be easily recognized.Factors influencing habit include: a combination {{of two or more}} crystal forms; trace impurities present during growth; crystal twinning and growth conditions (i.e., heat, pressure, space); and specific growth tendencies such as <b>growth</b> <b>striations.</b> Minerals belonging to the same crystal system do not necessarily exhibit the same habit. Some habits of a mineral are unique to its variety and locality: For example, while most sapphires form elongate barrel-shaped crystals, those found in Montana form stout tabular crystals. Ordinarily, the latter habit is seen only in ruby. Sapphire and ruby are both varieties of the same mineral; corundum.|$|E

The results indicate that microbial carbonates occur in Shuiweiling beachrocks and cements related to microbial activitives are common. Microbial carbonates were mainly developed on the surfaces of coral skeletons and within the coral (fragments and shivers) skeletal cavities, and rarely grew in interspaces formed by coral and other biological detritus. The growth morphologies of microbial carbonates are various, including stromatolitic lamination, thin crusts, dome-like, and microbialites. Microbial carbonates commonly trap fine-sized bioclasts, contain tubular filaments, and show laminated <b>growth</b> <b>striation.</b> Microbial carbonates within the coral skeletal cavities are generally stromatolitic cone-shaped, with a random growth direction along the bearing of trend of cavities, showing distinct growth laminae and recognizable growth phases.

Further, a detailed study of the striation formation process at high <b>growth</b> rates where <b>striations</b> were readily seen was carried out for the later comparison with that at low growth rates. The environment effect, such as air vs vacuum, was also undertaken.

50|$|The shell has an {{elongate}} conic shape. Its length measures 6.8 mm. The {{shell is}} flesh colored, excepting a broad chestnut band which covers the median {{third of the}} last whorl. This dark band really consists of two chestnut-colored zones, the anterior of which embraces half of the band while the posterior is equal to one-fourth of {{the width of the}} dark area. The two zones are separated by a zone of a little lighter shade which is as wide as the posterior zone. The whorls of the protoconch are decollated in all the specimens seen. The 8 or 9 whorls of the teleoconch are situated rather high between the sutures, feebly shouldered at the summit, and slightly constricted at the periphery. The early whorls of the teleoconch are marked by low, rounded, broad, almost vertical axial ribs which are wider than the shallow impressed spaces that separate them. On the later whorls the axial ribs become quite obsolete. On the first of the whorls of the teleoconch there are eighteen of these ribs; on the second to fourth, twenty; on the fifth they become decidedly feeble; and on the remainder they are not at all differentiated. In addition to the axial sculpture the surface of the shell is marked by very fine, wavy, closely spaced spiral striations. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is moderately long, and well rounded. It is marked by lines of <b>growth</b> and spiral <b>striations</b> comparable to those on the spire. The aperture is broadly oval.

The two whorls of the protoconch are large, compared with the early whorls of the teleoconch, helicoid, depressed, smooth, having their axis almost at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls and extending beyond the outline of these on the left side. The first three whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, the next five considerably flattened, the seven others decidedly obese. The first five are vitreous, but as the shell grows older it gradually becomes milk-white. The summits of the whorls are closely appressed to the preceding whorl, the appressed portion appearing as a narrow band, which at first sight appears as the suture. This, however, is very inconspicuous. All the whorls of the teleoconch are marked by fine lines of growth and fine, closely placed, wavy spiral striations. The periphery and {{the base of the}} body whorl are well rounded. They are marked by lines of <b>growth</b> and spiral <b>striations</b> as between the sutures. The area immediately adjoining the columella is decidedly depressed, forming a pit, but the axis is not perforate. The aperture is auriform, moderately large, and oblique. The posterior angle is acute, slightly channeled at the junction of the outer lip and columella. The columella is rather strong, very oblique, revolute showing only the lamellar posterior fold when the lip is complete. This fold is situated a little anterior to the insertion of the columella.

40|$|Recognizing the structure, {{evolution}} and fluid flow within the earth's crust {{is a critical}} issue for both academic and applied geoscience. This study presents structural analysis of an anticline, which aim is to elucidate the (1) structure and evolution of the fold, {{as well as the}} associated faults and fractures, (2) to better investigate how tectonics have impacted the microstructural character of the host rock, and (3) to discuss possible implications for petrophysical properties and fluid flow in carbonate reservoir rocks. The topography and geology of northern Tunisia bears a strong imprint of the Atlassic/Alpine collision between Eurasia and Africa, which resulted in the formation of a series of NE-SW trending elongate mountains and basins across the region. A complex tectonic history in Pre- Atlassic times, involving elements of compression, rifting, inversion, strike-slip, vulcanisme and diapirism, also contributes to a complex present-day structural framework. The front of the Tunisian Atlas Mountain Belt ends into a relatively undeformed and stable geological region, known as the Pelagian Province, which comprises the areas of eastern Tunisia, northwestern Libya and extends to offshore Malta and Italy. The study area is located in the boundary between these two geological regions. For the structural and petrophysical characterization of the host rocks and fault rocks in the study area, a variety of methods were used, including i) field mapping and structural cross-sections, ii) outcrop analysis (e. g. fracture density scanlines), iii) thin section analysis, iv) in-situ mechanical strength measurements using a rebound hammer, v) seismic interpretation. This study investigates the structure and evolution of the Jebel Fadeloun anticline, which is located in northeastern Tunisia, near the Gulf of Hammamet. Jebel Fadeloun is a 350 m high hill, formed by a NE-SW trending anticline. The core of the fold uncovers Aptian Limestone. Moving away from the centre, the lithologies, which all pre-date folding, comprise alternating units of limestone and marl, and show youngest formation of Eocene age. Several sets of faults dissect the fold, showing offsets within seismic resolution. Calcite <b>growth</b> and <b>striations</b> in the fault slip planes, indicate dominant normal sense of displacement, occasionally with a component of strike-slip. Fault analyses reveal that fracture frequencies and fault rocks are heterogeneously distributed within the fault zones. Deformed rocks display a variety of microtectonic structures, including brecciation, fracturing, calcite twins and pressure solutions seams. In general, the faulting accounts for enhanced porosities in the carbonate rocks, ranging up to 20 times higher than the host rock porosity. The findings of this study indicates that the Jebel Fadeloun anticline corresponds to a buried structure, formed- and aligned parallel with the Tunisian Atlas structures in Late Miocene-Pliocene. Its proposed origin is contractional ramp-related folding. It is suggested that the faults developed either contemporaneous or subsequent to the folding, and relates to similar stress states. Based on the fault analyses and microscopy analyses it is proposed that the fault zones represent combined conduit-barrier systems for fluid flow...|$|R
