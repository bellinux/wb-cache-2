5|$|Aggarwal <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel alkylation involving a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ. The method too has limited substrate scope, failing for any electrophiles possessing basic substituents due to competitive {{consumption of the}} carbenoid.|$|E
5|$|Football is Croatia's {{most popular}} team sport, and the {{national}} team <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> extensive fan-base since its official formation in 1991. Following Croatia's successful 1998 World Cup campaign, {{three years after the}} Croatian war of independence, there was a rapid rise in domestic and global attention for the national side. English journalist Marcus Tanner of Balkan Insight commented that the national team became a symbol of Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. However, after the death of former-president Franjo Tuđman, local political ties with the national team have loosened.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the events}} of InFamous, Cole (Eric Ladin) and his friend Zeke (Caleb Moody) meet with NSA agent Lucy Kuo (Dawn Olivieri), who informs them that Dr. Sebastian Wolfe (Michael Ensign), the man {{responsible}} for creating the Ray Sphere that gave Cole his powers, <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> even stronger version that would give him enough strength to stop the Beast. Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but even his most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Church of the SubGenius' {{ostensible}} beliefs defy categorization or {{a simple}} narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted. The group <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, {{which is usually}} considered by observers to satirize other religions. Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah1, is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah1 gave him supernatural knowledge {{of the past and}} future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.|$|E
5|$|Their sting {{generally}} only {{causes a}} mild local reaction in humans; however, {{it is one}} of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus Myrmecia. The ant venom is particularly immunogenic for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant allergies. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from anaphylactic reactions (increased heart rate, falling blood pressure, and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, there were four deaths due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).|$|E

30|$|We {{performed}} a 4 -day-rush protocol on 2 {{of our patients}} (patients numbered 1 and 2) who <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> anaphylaxis due to venom immunotherapy. One of these patients <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> monthly maintenance level, while the other one had an initial build-up phase anaphylaxis. One patient who had received an immunotherapy due to HDM had a monthly maintenance level, whereas two patients <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> initial build-up phase anaphylaxis (patients numbered 4, 5 and 6). Three of the patients who had anaphylaxis during the immunotherapy <b>had</b> also <b>developed</b> papular urticarial lesions during reaction (patients numbered 1, 6, and 7).|$|R

25|$|Reform Judaism, called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in {{relatively}} universalist terms, rejects {{most of the}} ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets.

25|$|Tang poetry <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> <b>an</b> ongoing {{influence}} on world literature and modern and quasi-modern poetry; for instance, {{as in the}} case of Li Bai (also known as Li Po) whose modern influence extends as far as Gustav Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde and Beat poetry. In part because of the prevalence of rhymed and parallel structures within Tang poetry, it also has a role in linguistics studies, such as in the reconstruction of Middle Chinese pronunciation.|$|E
