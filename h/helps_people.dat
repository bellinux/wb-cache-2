5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} we raise {{in this paper}} is why some women choose not to go into computing. What motivates their rea-sons for selecting their major and occupational goals? We interviewed twelve first year women who are not majoring in Computer Science and found half had pro-social goals for their careers. When asked if participants thought that people working in computing are <b>helping</b> <b>people,</b> some {{told us that they}} hadn’t thought about it before or they thought that maybe computing <b>helped</b> <b>people</b> indirectly through“busi-ness ” aspects. We showed them pictures where technology obviously <b>helped</b> <b>people,</b> such as sign language translation for the deaf. Most were really interested in these pictures, and given the opportunity, thought that they would be in-terested in participating — they just never thought of com-puting or technology as <b>helping</b> <b>people...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer <b>helps</b> <b>people</b> who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

Most of the korean foods can be 'anju', because it totally depends on diner's taste.|$|E
