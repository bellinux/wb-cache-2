40|$|While the {{question}} of whether our actions are determined or are the result of free will is a deep one in philosophy, it {{does not need to be}} answered for forensic psychiatrists to give evidence in court. As Stephen Morse has pointed out, the absence of free will is not named as an excusing condition. The insanity defense, for instance, requires proof of functional impairment, to which psychiatrists can usefully testify. Of the approaches available to determinism, my own preference is that of Herbert Hart: until we know that determinism is true, we will continue to prefer a system that requires persons to have made proper choices to act as they did before we hold them responsible. This seems to resemble Dr. Felthous ’ preferred option, that mentally responsible choices are choices made in the presence of a relatively natural ability to have decided otherwise. J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 36 : 25 – 6, 2008 Dr. Felthous 1 argues in the second part of his essay that forensic psychiatrists can help the criminal courts by describing the ways in which a mentally disordered defendant made his decisions and formed his intentions. I agree. This is, as Felthous points out, an essentially <b>functional</b> <b>inquiry,</b> and psychiatrist...|$|E
40|$|Autism and autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders diagnosed {{based on}} a triad of criteria: deficits in language and communication; impaired or abnormal social interactions; and restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. The high heritability of ASDs—up to 90 % in monozygotic twins—when taken {{in conjunction with the}} prominence of ASDs in genetic syndromes (e. g., tuberous sclerosis complex [TSC], fragile X, Angelman, Phelan McDermid) indicates that genetic factors {{play a key role in}} the etiology of these disorders. Additionally, recent work has identified several synaptic genes as candidates that may afford susceptibility to ASDs. Findings from human genetic studies and <b>functional</b> neurobiological <b>inquiries</b> are coalescing in a map of the molecular pathways that when disrupted may be responsible for the origination of ASDs. In addition, the accretion of these findings has provided important insights concerning how a relatively broad group of neurodevelopmental disorders, with putative diverse genetic etiologies, may converge upon common proteins found at the synapse...|$|R
5000|$|Pragmatism was not {{the first}} to apply {{evolution}} to theories of knowledge: Schopenhauer advocated a biological idealism as what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an [...] "ecological" [...] account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. Real and true are <b>functional</b> labels in <b>inquiry</b> and cannot be understood outside of this context. It is not realist in a traditionally robust sense of realism (what Hilary Putnam would later call metaphysical realism), but it is realist in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel visual design for {{information}} dense summaries of patient data with applications in biofeedback rehabilitation. The problem is important in review of large medical datasets where the clinicians require that both summary and all the performance details be shown at the same time. There are two main ideas (a) Summarizing data along the conceptual facets (accuracy / flow / openness) and the temporal facets (session / set / trial) in the biofeedback therapy. The conceptual facets represent key information needed by the experts to review patient performance. (b) Effectively present the data trends and the details in context of the entire performance. The summary incorporates ideas from graphic design and reveals the performance data at two time scales. Our preliminary user study is promising with some significant results. They indicate that our visual summaries are useful, <b>functional</b> and promote <b>inquiry...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Drug use {{patterns}} and serious bloodborne infections commonly have dermatologic manifestations among illicit injection-drug users (IDUs). Objective: To assess how self-reported skin conditions of IDUs may correlate with underlying infectious diseases after adjustment {{for drug use}} patterns. Methods: Prospective analysis of factors associated with self-reports of skin rashes, cellulitis, oral lesions, and lymphadenopathy obtained from 1, 065 IDUs enrolled in a large cohort study. Variables potentially associated with each outcome were evaluated using multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results: In multivariate analyses, drug use patterns were associated with cellulitis, whereas human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis C (HCV) were not. HCV infection was independently associated with skin rashes (odds ratio [OR] 1. 85; 95 % CI 1. 17 – 2. 94). HIV infection was independently associated with lymphadenopathy (OR 2. 00; 95 % CI 1. 52 – 2. 63), skin rash (OR 2. 12; 95 % CI 1. 57 – 2. 86), and oral lesions (OR 14. 95; 95 % CI 9. 41 – 23. 76). Conclusions: Self-reports of IDUs, which could easily be obtained {{as part of a}} <b>functional</b> <b>inquiry</b> in a clinical setting, correlate with specific drug use {{patterns and}} underlying bloodborne infections.

40|$|Drawing on Foucault’s ‘Discipline and Punish’, Deleuze {{argues that}} our {{environment}} {{has shifted from}} disciplinary societies to ‘societies of control ’ (Deleuze, 1992). He states that {{we are living in}} a generalized crisis where spaces of enclosure mould people into data ‘dividuals’. “In the societies of control, on the other hand, what is important is no longer either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a password, while on the other hand disciplinary societies are regulated by watchwords (as much as {{from the point of view}} of integration as from that of resistance). The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become “dividuals, ” and masses, samples, data, markets, or “banks. ” […] The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. ” (Deleuze, 1992 : 6) As the quote illustrates, Deleuze tries to understand individuals and their behaviour. Not only in ‘Society of Control ’ but also in ‘Capitalism and Schizophrenia’, Deleuze seeks to connect politics and economy to problems of environmental control and ecological change. He understands individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of control; individuals are continuously and limitlessly controlled by systems of domination. Deleuze’s eclectic ontology reinterprets works of other philosophers (such as Kant, Nietzsche, Foucault and Marx) and artists (for example Proust and Kafka) to describe his vision on our contemporary society. Even though his work might be influenced by the ethical naturalism of Spinoza and Nietzsche, this article mainly focuses on normative ethics. Instead of seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties, Deleuze centres his attention on practical issues. In ‘Society of Control ’ Deleuze evaluates the following question: What should we do with these societies of control? While two third of his <b>functional</b> <b>inquiry</b> describes what a society of control does and how it works, it however fails to thoroughly investigate how we should respond to this phenomenon. Deleuze states...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of community structures in networks {{is an important}} issue in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks (objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological <b>inquiries</b> (<b>functional</b> studies in metabolic and protein networks), or technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types of algorithms exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a general and quantitative definition of community is not implemented in the algorithms, leading to an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results without any additional nontopological information. In this article we deal with this problem by showing how quantitative definitions of community are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a local algorithm to detect communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The algorithm is tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular, we show how the algorithm applies to a network of scientific collaborations, which, for its size, cannot be attacked with the usual methods. This type of local algorithm could open the way to applications to large-scale technological and biological systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} chemical contaminants {{in the environment}} is an undeniable concern to human health and ecosystems. Historically, by relying heavily upon costly and laborious animal-based toxicity assays, the field of toxicology has often neglected examinations of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of toxicity {{for the majority of}} compounds - information that, if available, would strengthen risk assessment analyses. With its unique genetic tools and a high degree of conservation with more complex organisms, the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an appealing organism in which to conduct <b>functional</b> <b>inquiries</b> into the modes of chemical toxicity. In this series of studies, the yeast deletion mutant collection was screened to identify strains exhibiting altered growth in the presence of various environmental contaminants. This technique, known as functional profiling or functional genomics, yielded (1) novel insights into chemical toxicity; (2) pathways and mechanisms deserving of further study; and (3) candidate human toxicant susceptibility or resistance genes. Functional profiling determined the toxic mechanism of the dieldrin organochlorinated pesticide in yeast. Exposure to dieldrin has been linked to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, endocrine disruption, and cancer, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of toxicity behind these effects remain largely unknown. A functional genomics approach in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that dieldrin altered leucine availability. This model was supported by multiple lines of congruent evidence: (1) mutants defective in amino acid signaling or transport were sensitive to dieldrin, which was reversed by the addition of exogenous leucine; (2) dieldrin sensitivity of wild-type or mutant strains was dependent upon leucine concentration in the media; (3) overexpression of proteins that increased intracellular leucine conferred resistance to dieldrin; (4) leucine uptake was inhibited in the presence of dieldrin; and (5) dieldrin induced the amino acid starvation response. Additionally, it was shown that appropriate negative regulation of the Ras/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, along with an intact pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was required for dieldrin tolerance. A model connecting leucine uptake, Ras/PKA signaling, and pyruvate dehydrogenase was hypothesized. Many yeast dieldrin tolerance genes described have orthologs that may modulate dieldrin toxicity in humans. Yeast functional profiling was also conducted with toxaphene, an environmentally persistent mixture of chlorinated terpenes previously utilized as an insecticide. Toxaphene exposure has been previously associated with various cancers and diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these toxic effects have not been well established. In this section, a functional approach in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that toxaphene affected yeast mutants defective in (1) processes associated with transcription elongation and (2) nutrient utilization. Synergistic growth defects were observed upon exposure to both toxaphene and the known transcription elongation inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA). However, unlike MPA, toxaphene did not deplete nucleotides and additionally had no detectable effect on transcription elongation. It was concluded that toxaphene likely affects a process closely associated with transcription elongation, such as mRNA processing, mRNA nuclear export, or transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Future studies are required to pinpoint the exact mechanism, and again, many of the yeast genes identified in this chapter have human homologs, warranting further investigations into the potentially conserved mechanisms of toxaphene toxicity. A functional screen was devised to identify yeast cellular processes and pathways affected by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent frequently utilized in toxicological and pharmaceutical investigations. As such, it is important to establish the cellular and molecular targets of DMSO in order to differentiate its intrinsic effects from those elicited by a compound of interest. A genome-wide functional screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified deletion mutants exhibiting sensitivity to 1 % DMSO, a concentration standard to yeast chemical profiling studies. Mutants defective in Golgi/ER transport were found to be sensitive to DMSO, including those lacking components of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. Moreover, strains deleted for members of the SWR 1 histone exchange complex were hypersensitive to DMSO, with additional chromatin remodeling mutants displaying a range of growth defects. DNA repair genes were also identified as important for DMSO tolerance. Finally, it was demonstrated that overexpression of histone H 2 A. Z, which replaces chromatin-associated histone H 2 A in a SWR 1 -catalyzed reaction, conferred resistance to DMSO. Once again, many yeast DMSO tolerance genes described have homologs in more complex organisms, and the data provided is applicable to future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DMSO toxicity. Finally, a framework for semi-automated functional yeast screening of toxicants is described. Pool growths, chemical exposures, and DNA extraction of barcodes described above were conducted manually, which limited throughput. Additionally, identification of mutants with altered growth in a toxicant required hybridizations to costly microarrays. To transition to a more high-throughput environment, a liquid handler was utilized in conjunction with purpose-built software to perform five and fifteen generations screens of the homozygous diploid yeast deletion collection with various emerging environmental contaminants. Genomic DNA was extracted from the pools with robotics, and the barcodes uniquely identifying each deletion strain were amplified by PCR using primers indexed for sequencing on Illumina machinery. Future studies are needed to analyze the sequencing results and identify strains significantly sensitive or resistant to each of the compounds...|$|R
40|$|Two key {{characteristics}} of the neo-Darwinian synthesis in evolutionary biology have been its emphasis {{on the importance of}} mutations of small effect (micromutationism) and the view that studies of individual gene function shed relatively little light on evolutionary processes. Recent advances in molecular biology, however, have broken down many of the barriers between <b>functional</b> and evolutionary <b>inquiry,</b> opening the door to detailed studies of the genetic basis of functional trait evolution in plants. In this article, we review the insights into plant evolution that have been provided by molecular methods and address future research needs. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in crop and model plants has shown that individual loci often have large effects on trait variation, at variance with the micromutationist perspective. Evidence so far indicates that QTLs with large effects are also important in wild populations, underlying interspecific differences as well as intraspecific variation. Isolation of some of these QTLs, in particular for flowering time variation, has revealed a prominent role for regulatory genes known to function in regulation of flowering and exposed the complexity of regulatory processes. Preliminary evidence indicates that plant growth variation may be directly regulated rather than primarily the indirect result of selection on constituent processes. Future research should expand the number of traits that are intensively studied and make greater use of QTL mapping in wild plant taxa, especially those undergoing adaptive radiations, while continuing to draw on insights from model plants. Promising techniques include testing of candidate gene-trait associations in wild populations, genetic mapping in hybrid zones, and microarray analyses of gene expression...|$|R
