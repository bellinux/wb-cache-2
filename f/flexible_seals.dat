Porcelain is impervious to moisture once sealed by fired glaze and is low cost and flexible to manufacture.

All upper surfaces at the hinge points are formed by continuous <b>flexible</b> <b>seals</b> preventing leak- through causing drag and turbulence problems with the ailerons and flaps.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of the hinge-moment characteristics of various sealed-internal-balance arrangements for control surfaces are presented. The analysis considered overhands sealed to various types of wing structure by <b>flexible</b> <b>seals</b> spanning gaps of various widths or sealed to the wing structure by a flexible system of linked plates. Leakage was not considered; the seal was assumed to extend the full spanwise length of the control surface. The effect of the developed width of the flexible seal and of the geometry of the structure to which the seal was anchored was investigated, {{as well as the}} effect of the gap width that is sealed. The results of the investigation indicated that the most nearly linear control-surface hinge-moment characteristics can probably be obtained from a flexible seal over a narrow gap (about 0. 1 of the overhang chord), which is so installed that the motion of the seal is restricted to a region behind the point of attachment of the seal to the wing structure. Control-surface hinge moments that tend to be high at large deflections and low or overbalanced at small deflections will result if a very narrow seal is used...|$|E
40|$|Different heat {{transfer}} enhancers are reviewed. They are (a) fins and microfins, (b) porous media, (c) large particles suspensions, (d) nanofluids, (e) phase-change devices, (f) <b>flexible</b> <b>seals,</b> (g) flexible complex seals, (h) vortex generators, (i) protrusions, and (j) ultra high thermal conductivity composite materials. Most of {{heat transfer}} augmentation methods {{presented in the}} literature that assists fins and microfins in enhancing heat transfer are reviewed. Among these are using joint-fins, fin roots, fin networks, biconvections, permeable fins, porous fins, capsulated liquid metal fins, and helical microfins. It is found that not much agreement exists between works of the different authors regarding single phase heat transfer augmented with microfins. However, too many works having sufficient agreements {{have been done in}} the case of two phase heat transfer augmented with microfins. With respect to nanofluids, there are still many conflicts among the published works about both heat transfer enhancement levels and the corresponding mechanisms of augmentations. The reasons beyond these conflicts are reviewed. In addition, this paper describes flow and heat transfer in porous media as a well-modeled passive enhancement method. It is found that there are very few works which dealt with heat transfer enhancements using systems supported with flexible/flexible-complex seals. Eventually, many recent works related to passive augmentations of heat transfer using vortex generators, protrusions, and ultra high thermal conductivity composite material are reviewed. Finally, theoretical enhancement factors along with many heat transfer correlations are presented in this paper for each enhancer...|$|E

40|$|The calm-water {{resistance}} for Surface Effect Ships (SESs) is {{studied with}} consideration for {{bow and stern}} seal interaction effects. Existing methods for SES resistance prediction {{have been unable to}} accurately predict bow/stern seal drag, which have been experimentally observed to be dominant in some cases in the low-speed regime. Prediction of the total resistance in the low-speed regime is of particular importance for SESs intended to operate at relatively low speeds (e. g. 40 knots) to ensure adequate propulsion power is installed to surpass the secondary drag hump. The primary objective of this work is to study the effects of bow/stern seal interaction on SES total resistance in steady-state operations. A simple, effective, 2 -D numerical model is developed based on coupling a linearized potential-flow solver with a single-degree-of-freedom seal model and rigid body vessel motion model. Systematic validation studies are shown for the fluid and solid models. The resistance of a model-scale SES is predicted with both rigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>seals</b> to determine the influence of seal flexibility. The predicted seal resistance and vessel motion, as well as surface wave patterns, are compared with published experimental results. The numerical model is found to offer accurate predictions for the low-speed resistance of SES seal drag and vessel motion. When combined with other methods for predicting the other components of resistance, the total resistance is predicted reasonably accurately across a large range of Froude numbers. In addition, the physical mechanism that causes the large drag hump at lower speeds is identified as being related to the interaction of the bow seal wave with the stern seal. This interaction is found to be most important at the subhump and to become relatively minor at higher speeds. Thus, a hybrid method is proposed where the numerical model for seal drag is used at low speeds and a more traditional prediction method that ignores seal effects is used at higher speeds, where seal effects are small. Based on the results of this work, {{it may be possible to}} improve SES seal designs and overall vessel performance by introducing the possibility for actively-controlled morphing/contouring seals...|$|E
