In response, editors and writers of 52 indicated Anarky would be included in the series. However, the series concluded without Anarky making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series for the failed appearance.|$|E

5|$|In 1860 Matejko {{published}} an illustrated album, Clothing in Poland (Ubiory w Polsce), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records {{of all kinds}} and his desire to promote such <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> Polish people, to intensify their patriotism. His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, Death of Wapowski during the crowning of Henry Valois (Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego, 1861) and Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka (Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki, 1862), which settled his debts.|$|E
5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|International {{publishers}} expressed {{some interest}} in carrying Elmer, {{but none of them}} would commit to it.

After Alanguilan exchanged emails with publisher Dan Vado, Slave Labor Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kneale {{was once again}} {{regularly}} writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled Quatermass. This time John Mills played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled The Quatermass Conclusion or Quatermass IV, for distribution abroad. There was, however, little <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> film distributors, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because the {{cultures}} associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse. Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history. For much of the 20th century, only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active. However, {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, there has been revival in <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} assumed {{for many years}} that people who commit sadistic or other violent crime possess an {{unhealthy}} fascination with violence and death. Numerous {{studies have focused on}} levels of such sensational <b>interests</b> <b>among</b> criminal populations with a view to rehabilitation. What appears to be missing from current literature is an examination of sensational <b>interests</b> <b>among</b> those who work with, or aspire to work with, criminal populations. Further, we have yet to examine whether prolonged exposure to popular media influences levels of sensational interests. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study compares levels of sensational <b>interests</b> <b>among</b> 240 students in criminal justice related majors with non-criminal justice majors using an adapted version of the Sensational Interests Questionnaire (SIQ), and the effect that popular media has on sensational interests. In keeping with previous tests of sensational interests, personality traits are also examined. Results from the study indicate students in criminal justice related majors have significantly higher levels of sensational interests than non-criminal justice related majors, and the number of hours spent watching crime related television shows is the best predictor of sensational interests. Further, {{there are a number of}} similarities found between predictors of sensational interests for students in criminal justice related majors and predictors of sensational <b>interests</b> <b>among</b> offenders examined in earlier studies. Implications from the study for criminal justice educators and practitioners are discussed...|$|R

5|$|On {{its initial}} release week, Ace Attorney Investigations 2 was the top-selling game in Japan across all platforms, selling more than 132,000 units. This {{was lower than}} the first Ace Attorney Investigations, which sold 172,000 copies during its opening week. The Japanese sales tracker Media Create theorized that {{this was due to}} Ace Attorney Investigations 2 having less TV {{commercials}} than the first game, and a lower level of consumer recognition according to weekly recognition surveys. They also noted that marketing had been targeting women more than men, leading to an increased <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> women, but decreased interest both among men and overall. During the game's second week, it dropped to fourth place in the Japanese game sales charts, selling an additional 30,910 copies.|$|E
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future crimes that will threaten national <b>interest.</b> <b>Among</b> other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|Teaming {{with his}} daughter, Christina Engelbart, in 1988 {{he founded the}} Bootstrap Institute to {{coalesce}} his ideas {{into a series of}} three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University 1989–2000. By the early 1990s there was sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT), while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.|$|E

5|$|The {{friendship}} between Byron and Giraud {{has become a}} topic of <b>interest</b> <b>among</b> scholars and biographers of Byron. Many believe that the pair's relationship was platonic, but correspondence between Byron and his friends has been used since the late 20th century {{to argue that the}} two were engaged in a love affair. The earliest claim of a sexual relationship between them comes from George Colman's poem Don Leon, in which Byron is the principal character and Giraud is portrayed as his liberator from the sexual prejudices in Britain. The poem is not biographical; it promotes Colman's own social and political views.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts.

The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay.
