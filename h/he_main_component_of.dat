5000|$|Although Bender {{was made}} in 2996, his head is an {{additional}} 1055 years old due to it being stuck in the ground for years after he travelled back in time. In [...] "Bender's Big Score", <b>he</b> becomes the <b>main</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the nudist aliens' plan to steal every valuable item from the past. As the Time Sphere can only travel backwards in time, when he completes his task every time, he hides in the limestone cavern under Planet Express {{waiting for the right}} moment to come out. As the number of times he has traveled back in time and the time periods he went to became unlimited, it is not clear as to how old Bender {{is at the end of}} the film. Also, in [...] "The Late Phillip J. Fry", he is infinitely old due to him having to travel through the time span of the universe twice. Thanks to this it makes him the second oldest character. This is due to Fry being from the 20th century and the multiple time travels he has gone through.|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{study of}} {{associations}} of planktonic foraminifera in cores MD 95 - 2043 and ODP 977, {{located in the}} Alboran Sea (Mediterranean Sea), has allowed the identification of 29 new faunal events,defined by abrupt changes in the abundances of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (right and left coiling), Turborotalita quinqueloba, Globorotalia scitula, Globorotalia inflata, Globigerina bulloides and Globigerinoides ruber (white and pink varieties). The age model for ODP 977 was based on that of MD 95 - 2043 [Cacho et al. (1999),Paleoceanogr. 14, 698 - 705], on the isotopic stratigraphy,and on two AMS 14 C measurements. Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) were estimated for the last 54 kyr using the Modern Analog Technique (MAT) and were compared with the SSTs provided by the U 37 (k 0) method. The U 37 (k 0) record {{is very similar to}} the MAT annual mean temperature record for the last 8 kyr. However, for older times alkenone-derived temperatures are consistently higher than the annual MAT temperatures. This offset may be due to an underestimation of the SST provided by the planktonic foraminiferal method for glacial times, to an overestimation of the U 37 (k 0) record, or to changes in the seasonal production of alkenones. Most of the variability in the fauna is related to the millennial variability of Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events. During Heinrich events (HEs) and most of the other D-O stadials, G. bulloides, T. quinqueloba and G. scitula increased, while N. pachyderma (right coiling), G. inflata and G. ruber decreased. By contrast, N. pachyderma (left coiling) was only abundant in the <b>HEs.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the associations -N. pachyderma (right coiling) - follows a general trend similar to that of sea-level and delta 18 O. This species reached its highest abundance during the Last Glacial Maximum, when sea-level was at a lower position. The occurrence of a shallower nutricline owing to a shallowing of the interface between Atlantic inflowing and Mediterranean outflowing waters could have favoured the development of neogloboquadrinids {{in the vicinity of the}} Strait of Gibraltar...|$|R
