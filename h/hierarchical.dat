5|$|When used together, these {{features}} allow for assembling a complex distributed computing environment by reusing the existing <b>hierarchical</b> name system.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, a <b>hierarchical</b> {{clustering}} may {{be represented}} as a binary tree with the points at its leaves; the clusters of the clustering are the sets of points in subtrees descending from each node of the tree.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} {{based on}} interconnected networks {{need to have}} some kind of routing to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be <b>hierarchical</b> in large multiprocessor machines.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{has also}} been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a <b>hierarchical</b> theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The Han Empire {{was divided}} by <b>hierarchical</b> {{political}} {{divisions in the}} following descending order: provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), and counties (xian). This model of local government was adopted from the previous government structure of the Qin dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The command {{structure}} is <b>hierarchical,</b> with divisions and brigades controlling groups of units. Major units are regiment- or battalion-sized, and minor units are company-sized units (or platoons). All units are Regular (full-time) or Army Reserve (part-time).|$|E
5|$|The {{input to}} a {{clustering}} problem {{consists of a}} set of points. A cluster is any proper subset of the points, and a <b>hierarchical</b> clustering is a maximal family of clusters with the property that any two clusters in the family are either nested or disjoint.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} and implemented in 1982 by Jean-Paul Benzécri and J. Juan. They based this algorithm on earlier methods that constructed <b>hierarchical</b> clusterings using mutual nearest neighbor pairs without taking advantage of nearest neighbor chains.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to linear order (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (<b>hierarchical</b> order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on <b>hierarchical</b> order {{in a manner that is}} hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to <b>hierarchical</b> order insofar as <b>hierarchical</b> order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on <b>hierarchical</b> order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect <b>hierarchical</b> order alone, e.g.|$|E
25|$|The Kula {{trade was}} {{organized}} {{differently in the}} more <b>hierarchical</b> parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In <b>hierarchical</b> areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less <b>hierarchical</b> areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the <b>hierarchical</b> areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less <b>hierarchical</b> areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between two models is that <b>hierarchical</b> model can explicitly make causal inference to predict certain stimulus while non-hierarchical model can only predict joint probability of stimuli. However, <b>hierarchical</b> model {{is actually a}} special case of non-hierarchical model by setting joint prior as a weighted average of the prior to common and independent causes, each weighted by their prior probability. Based on the correspondence of these two models, we can also say that <b>hierarchical</b> is a mixture modal of non-hierarchical model.|$|E

25|$|Finally, <b>hierarchical</b> {{architectures}} {{have better}} tolerance to clutter. Clutter problem arises when the target object {{is in front}} of a non-uniform background, which functions as a distractor for the visual task. <b>Hierarchical</b> architecture provides signatures for parts of target objects, which do not include parts of background and are not affected by background variations.|$|E
25|$|CTM allows {{modeling}} of <b>hierarchical</b> refinements in the classification tree, also called implicit dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of <b>hierarchical</b> models which take into account the rich <b>hierarchical</b> structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a <b>hierarchical</b> model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the <b>hierarchical</b> hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hierarchical</b> module names. Module {{names are}} allowed to consist of dot-separated {{sequences}} of capitalised identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a <b>hierarchical</b> manner (e.g., Data.List instead of List), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, <b>hierarchical</b> {{architectures}} best {{accomplish the}} goal of ‘parsing’ a complex visual scene with many objects consisting of many parts, whose relative position may greatly vary. In this case, different elements of the system must react to different objects and parts. In <b>hierarchical</b> architectures, representations of parts {{at different levels of}} embedding hierarchy can be stored at different layers of hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|Early naturalists well {{understood}} {{the similarities and}} differences of living species leading Linnaeus to develop a <b>hierarchical</b> classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the <b>hierarchical</b> structure of the tree of life with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} section suggests one motivation for <b>hierarchical</b> image recognition architectures. However, they have other benefits as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hierarchical</b> Steiner {{chains are}} yet another generalization. If the two given circles of an {{ordinary}} Steiner chain are nested, i.e., if one lies entirely within the other, then the larger given circle circumscribes the Steiner-chain circles. In a <b>hierarchical</b> Steiner chain, each circle of a Steiner chain is itself the circumscribing given circle of another Steiner chain within it; this process may be repeated indefinitely, forming a fractal.|$|E
