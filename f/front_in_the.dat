5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds. When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold <b>front</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a strong upper level jet stream, tornado formation is possible. Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth, the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States, because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented Rocky Mountains, which can form a dryline, aid their development at any strength.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to have been from a decaying cold <b>front</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the tidal}} {{simulation}} of ECOMSED, the Simpson-Hunter(S-H) stratification parameter is calculated to study <b>the</b> tidal <b>fronts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> continental shelf of the South China Sea (SCS). The results show that, besides the tidal fronts around the Hainan Island {{which have been}} studied by Hu et al. (2003) [Hu, J. Y., Kawamura, H., Tang, D. L., 2003. Tidal front around the Hainan Island, northwest of the South China Sea. Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (C 11), 3342, doi: 10. 1029 / 2003 JC 001883], there are also five tidal <b>fronts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south of Taiwan Strait (ST'S), Pearl River estuary (PRE), Mekong River estuary (MRE), southwestern coast of Vietnam (SCV) and northern coast of east Malaysia (NCEM), and they are consistent with Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fronts detected by SeaWiFS. The positions of predicted tidal <b>fronts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> STS and PRE are also {{consistent with those of}} sea surface temperature (SST) fronts. The criterion value of S-H, 2. 6 - 2. 7, should be used for prediction of tidal <b>fronts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MRE and 2. 2 - 2. 4 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NCEM. Further studies show that tidal mixing can be considered as one of the main causes of the formation of Chl-a <b>fronts</b> <b>in</b> those five coastal sea areas, and the M- 2 tidal constituent {{plays an important role in}} tidal mixing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> STS, PRE, MRE and NCEM while both K- 1 and O- 1 play important roles in tidal mixing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SCV.

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold <b>front.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations. The rationale was that relentless pressure might trigger a German collapse. For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing rationale that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely to break in at least one section. The Soviet winter campaign included major assaults across the entire expanse the <b>front</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine, Belorussia and against the German Panther Line in the region of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{in support}} of the Nam River <b>front</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} part of the 25th Division sector were five batteries of the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions, firing 105mm howitzers, and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion which fired 155mm howitzers, for a total of 36 guns. One 155mm howitzer fired from Komam-ni to the area north of Chungam-ni, the route for the NK 6th Division's supplies. Another forward artillery piece kept the Iryong-ni bridge over the Nam under fire. The 25th Division artillery estimated it killed approximately 1,825 North Korean soldiers during the first three days of September. In this critical time, the US Fifth Air Force added its firepower to that of the division artillery {{in support of}} the ground force. Walker attributed the UN victory in this sector directly to the extensive air support his division received in the battle.|$|E
