5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and {{dependable}} (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in <b>Heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in <b>Heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Tracer (also {{known by}} her real name, Lena Oxton) is a player {{character}} {{appearing in the}} 2016 video game Overwatch, a Blizzard Entertainment–developed first-person shooter, and its related animated and literary media.

5|$|Despite {{being given}} a noncombatant role, she fought {{alongside}} the men of her unit in the battles of the Tarapacá Campaign in late 1879, at Pisagua and San Francisco. Her valor in these battles and her care for wounded men drew the attention of Chilean commander-in-chief Manuel Baquedano, who provided her with official recognition and the rank of a sergeant. She continued {{to serve in the}} army {{for the duration of the}} war and was famously courageous at the Battle of Tacna in 1880. After the war, she returned to civilian life and died in obscurity, aged only 25. Now considered one of Chile's greatest <b>heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, her service only became widely known after her death.|$|E
5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain <b>heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', {{and it probably}} fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E

5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata. The son of Pandava prince Arjuna (one of the main <b>heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mahabharata) and the Naga princess Ulupi, Iravan is the central deity of the cult of Kuttantavar {{which is also the}} name commonly given to him in that cult—and {{plays a major role in}} the cult of Draupadi. Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan. He is also a patron god of well-known transgender communities called ThiruNangai (also Aravani in Tamil, and Hijra throughout South Asia).|$|E
5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other <b>heroes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E
