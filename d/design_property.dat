An {{effort has been}} made to put forth the demand and dependency of quality software in our modern society. The demand has increased the size and complexity of computer software system during the past decades. The software industry is responding to the demand for high quality product by spending resources {{to improve the quality of}} software product. A brief introduction on software design, object-oriented approach and software quality has been given. Further, the discussion on quality attributes identified by various researchers and some important <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> are presented. Finally, it throws the light on the role of various <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, coupling and cohesion on quality attributes such as efficiency, complexity, understandability and reusability in order to assess the object oriented software product quality.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an improved Quality Testing Model for Object Oriented Design (QTMOOD) {{for the assessment}} of high-level design quality attributes in object-oriented design. The proposed model relates <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, coupling and cohesion to a reduced set of attributes such as efficiency, complexity, understandability and reusability from SATCâ€™s identified set of quality attributes. The relationship between quality attributes and <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> are weighted in accordance with their respective influence and importance of <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> on quality attributes. The model is validated empirically. Empirical data is collected from various application domains, and then analyzed using QTMOOD to support the validation. The result indicates that the proposed model may be used to provide an overall quality assessment of object-oriented software in early phase of development life cycle. Early use of the model may help to ensure that the favorable internal <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> will lead to the development of quality end product.

40|$|This thesis investigates user {{interaction}} in virtual environments and usability requirements {{to support that}} interaction. Studies of the design and use of virtual environments are used to demonstrate the need for interface design guidance. A theory of interaction for virtual environments is proposed, which includes predictive models of interactive behaviour {{and a set of}} generic <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> for supporting that behaviour. The models elaborate on D. A. Norman's cycle of action to describe the stages involved in three modes of behaviour: task and action based, exploratory and reactive. From the models, generic <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> are defined for various aspects of the virtual environment, such as its objects, actions and user representation. The models of interaction are evaluated through empirical studies of interactive behaviour which compare observed interaction patterns with those predicted. The generic <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> are evaluated through usability studies that investigate the links between missing <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> and usability problems encountered. Results from the evaluation studies provide general support for the theory and indicate specific refinements required. A controlled study is used to test the impact of the theory on interaction success, by comparing performance in virtual environments with and without implementation of the generic <b>design</b> <b>properties.</b> Significant improvements in interaction are found {{with the use of a}} virtual environment, after the predicted <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> have been implemented. Design guidelines are then developed from the theory and a hypertext tool designed to present the guidelines. The tool and guidelines are evaluated with industrial virtual environment designers to test the usability and utility of the guidance. Results indicate that the guidance is useful in addressing the practical problem of designing virtual environments for usability. Therefore, this thesis fulfils its objective of developing interface design guidelines for virtual environments, using interaction modelling as a theoretical base. Furthermore, it provides an improved understanding of {{user interaction}} in virtual environments and can be used to inform further theories, methods or tools for virtual environments and human-computer interfaces...|$|R

All Australian architecture schools and programs have recently moved to some variation on the 3 + 2 Bologna model, with a three-year undergraduate degree, followed by a two-year course-work based Master of Architecture professional degree. Some universities also require 6-12 months of practice work experience between the two degrees. Registration as an architect is via state-based boards and requires {{a minimum of two}} years practice experience under the supervision of a registered architect. In addition there are double degrees offered by many universities, such as those combining architecture with construction or landscape architecture. Some universities also offer masters programs in architecture via coursework or research. Many architecture faculties offer related programs in landscape architecture, urban planning, urban <b>design,</b> <b>property</b> and construction.

Information exchange in international supply chain is extremely inefficient, rather uncoordinated, based largely on paper, e-mail, phone and text message, and far too costly. This paper explores the <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> for a shared information infrastructure to exchange information between all parties in the supply chain, commercial parties as well as authorities, which is called a Shipping Information Pipeline. The contribution of the paper is to expand previous research with complementary key <b>design</b> <b>properties.</b> The paper starts with a review of existing literature on previous proposed solutions for increased collaboration in the supply chain for international trade, Inter-Organization Systems and Information Infrastructures. The paper argues why the previous attempts are inadequate to address the issues in the domain of international supply chains. Instead, a different set of key <b>design</b> <b>properties</b> are proposed for the Shipping Information Pipeline.

40|$|Java HotSpot VM {{provides}} a facility for replacing classes at runtime called HotSwap. One <b>design</b> <b>property</b> of HotSwap {{is that the}} signature of a replaced class must remain the same between different versions, which significantly constrains the programmer modifying a class to be replaced. Specifically, the programmer is precluded from adding new methods, constructors, or fields, or even changing the signatures of existing methods or fields. This paper presents a novel approach that overcomes these constraints of HotSwap by using binary refactoring, a technique that rewrites the binary representation of a program without affecting its functionality. A series of micro and macro benchmarks we conducted demonstrate that the approach is extensible and efficient. In particular, the new binary refactoring technique, which enables the approach, produces highly-efficient refactored application versions, outperforming a widely-used prior technique {{by as much as}} an order of magnitude. These initial results indicate that by rewriting the bytecode of a swapped program, one can effectively overcome constraints of HotSwap with minimal performance overhead...|$|E
