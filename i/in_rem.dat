5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E

Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized on the high seas. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} after a human baby is born, as its nervous system matures, neural {{patterns}} in sleep begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM sleep. (In faster-developing mammals this process occurs in utero.) Infants spend more time <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep than adults. The proportion of REM sleep then decreases significantly in childhood.

25|$|A {{newborn baby}} spends almost 9 {{hours a day}} just <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep.

25|$|Although it manifests {{differently}} in different animals, REM sleep {{or something like}} it occurs in all land mammals {{as well as in}} birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM. The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators enjoy more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> for longer, possibly because higher thermal inertia of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation. The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats. In utero, mammals spend more than half (50–80%) of a 24-hour day <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep.|$|E
25|$|Apart from this, the {{amygdala}} {{plays a role}} <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep modulation, supporting the hypothesis that REM sleep allows internal information processing.

In this sample of male twins, waking measures also showed a significant genetic component. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, {{and superior}} parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep as in wakefulness. The amygdala is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental {{suppression of the}} amygdala results in less REM sleep. The amygdala may also cardiac function {{in lieu of the}} less active insular cortex.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{may occur}} {{in those who}} are otherwise healthy, those with narcolepsy, or may run in families {{as a result of}} specific genetic changes.

Diagnosis is based on a person's description. Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.|$|E

25|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs, zopiclone causes {{a decrease in}} the core body temperature and is effective in decreasing sleep latency. It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount of time spent <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep as well as delaying its onset. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{has been found to be}} superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy.|$|E
25|$|REM {{sleep is}} physiologically {{different}} from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as non-REM sleep (NREM sleep, NREMS, synchronized sleep). REM and non-REM sleep alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of REM sleep. The transition to REM sleep brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called PGO waves originating in the brain stem. Organisms <b>in</b> <b>REM</b> sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.|$|E
