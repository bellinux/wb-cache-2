5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union had not flown {{any further}} flights {{by the time}} MA-7 landed, putting {{both sides of the}} Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission {{currently}} planned and press speculation about a one-day mission. However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing within a few minutes of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying a capsule to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, using technology being developed for the Gemini program. However, after examining the time and safety <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.|$|E

25|$|Feynman {{was fond}} of saying that all of quantum {{mechanics}} can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> single experiment.

25|$|The fielding side {{is limited}} to three overs per bowler, or in some formats only two overs. This ensures that the {{majority}} of each team is required to bowl. The tactical <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> rule for the fielding team captain are important as he must carefully decide when to bowl his experienced and inexperienced bowlers.|$|E

25|$|In response, {{director}} Michael S. Hart of Project Gutenberg offered {{support to}} keep the project online. This offer was declined by Feldmahler, who voiced concern about having the project hosted in the United States, and consulted the Canadian wing of Project Gutenberg. On November 2, 2007, Michael Geist, a prominent Canadian copyright academic, wrote an article for the BBC discussing the specifics and the wider <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case.|$|E
25|$|The only {{reference}} in the sources {{to any kind}} of treaty at Wedmore is the above quotation from Asser. All we know, therefore, is that it was at Wedmore that Guthrum accepted Alfred as his adoptive father and accepted the Christian faith. There was clearly an important element here of Alfred exercising his dominance; however, the source material provides no hint as to the wider <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> in terms of territory or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Major {{improvement}} {{to transport}} and communication systems brought crucial developments. The railways reduced {{the time and}} cost of travel and improved reliability in transporting cotton to the Lancashire towns. The Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association was established in 1841 and it quickly established a successful system of arbitration. The Transatlantic Telegraph Cable reduced long distance communication from weeks to minutes. Liverpool broker John Rew recognised the far-reaching <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> development and created the hedge fund system. This led to the hugely successful Liverpool Cotton Futures Market, which doubled {{the business of the}} Liverpool Cotton Market. In 1911-12 Liverpool imported 5,230,399 bales of cotton.|$|E
50|$|Arbitrary culture {{theory is}} the view that human {{behavior}} is purely a product of culture, and that culture is completely arbitrary. The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> idea is that evolution {{cannot be applied to}} human behavior.|$|R

25|$|Following {{their return}} from exile in Geneva {{during the reign}} of Queen Mary I and King Philip, English Protestants known as Puritans (who {{remained}} within the Church of England) and separatists (who separated from it) began to attempt to introduce some of the more radical reforms they had experienced in Geneva into the worship of the Church of England, and in some ways to go beyond them. They sought to rid worship of any element not specifically prescribed in the Bible, though they disagreed on the practical <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> They also favored liturgical decisions to be made at the lowest level possible, rather than by a regional or national authority.|$|E
25|$|While in Chicago, Rosenberg wrote {{politically}} charged plays {{to be performed}} in the several working-class theatres of the city. One of these dramas, Die Nihilisten (The Nihilists), was performed {{in honor of the}} Paris Commune in 1882 and featured three future defendants in the 1886 Haymarket affair — Michael Schwab, August Spies, and Oscar Neebe — playing leading roles. The play dealt with legal proceedings against a group of Nihilists in Tsarist Russia, who were sentenced to exile in Siberia, and finally freed by their comrades following the overthrow of the Tsar. In the May 18, 1882 performance in North Side Turner Hall, the role of the liberators was played by members of the local Lehr-und-Wehr Verein (Education and Defense Society), an armed workers' militia movement sweeping the German-American radical community in the Chicago area at the time. The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> casting could not be missed.|$|E

25|$|The Winters court {{reasoned}} that water rights were {{implied in the}} agreement {{that had been made}} with the American Indians in 1888, when the reservation was created. This agreement stated that the Fort Belknap Reservation had been created with the intention of the tribal people being able to become self-sufficient. The court noted that land without water has no value, especially when the purpose of a land was to help a group become self-supporting in the way of agriculture. Therefore, a reservation of water goes along with the reservation of the land. Water rights may be implied from American Indian reservations made by presidential executive order, or American Indian reservations which are created by an act of Congress. Other <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> court case include setting more of a standard for American Indian water rights along with setting a precedent for later Supreme Court cases which deal with implied water rights.|$|E
25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> discovery. The victimary {{process is the}} missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that {{at the beginning of}} all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{formula is}} that the sample size must be quadrupled (multiplied by 4) to achieve half (1/2) the measurement error. When designingstatistical studies where cost is a factor, this may have a role inunderstanding cost-benefit tradeoffs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> line <b>of</b> {{cases is}} that the INS {{doctrine}} is being given very limited scope, particularly in contexts in which copyright law may dominate the field. Decisions from other circuits {{are consistent with those}} from the Second Circuit.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is argued}} by Dick Roche that"The most {{important}} ingredient in rural development is population."
