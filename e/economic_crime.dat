25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, <b>economic</b> <b>crime</b> and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E

40|$|Although, <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> {{are not new}} {{phenomena}} in Nigeria, however, their size, sophistication and magnitude have changed in recent times. Theoretical literature on <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> and <b>economic</b> growth has generated a rich debate {{over the last few}} years producing scholars who theorized that <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> could be growth-enhancing and others who see it as growth-reducing. Where is Nigeria in this great debate? The failure to determine the nature of the relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> and <b>economic</b> growth in previous empirical works affected the choice of methodology employed by previous empirical works on Nigeria. This study is an attempt to offer a better methodology and proxy in the estimation of this relationship. Therefore, this study aims at providing robust econometric analysis, which deepens the understanding of the relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> and <b>economic</b> growth in Nigeria both in the short run and long run within the uninterrupted democratic dispensation period of 1999 to 2012 using OLS technique incarnated in a state-space time-varying methodology. Findings show a strong evidence of non-linear significant relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> and <b>economic</b> growth in Nigeria in the long-run with infinitesimal short run impact. The study also found a bi-directional causal relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>crimes</b> and <b>economic</b> growth in Nigeria and recommends, amongst others, a matrix of policies that address effective reduction of <b>economic</b> <b>crimes,</b> which includes heavy investment i...|$|R
