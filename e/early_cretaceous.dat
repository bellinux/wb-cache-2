5|$|Dromaeosauroides is a genus of dromaeosaurid {{theropod}} dinosaur {{from the}} <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> {{of what is}} now Denmark. It was discovered in the Jydegaard Formation in Robbedale, on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. This is the only likely place for dinosaur remains to be discovered on Danish territory, since the Mesozoic deposits exposed {{in the rest of the}} country are marine. Dromaeosauroides is the first known dinosaur from this location, and the only one which has been scientifically named. It is one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs in the world, and the first known uncontested dromaeosaur from the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Africa {{separated}} from Antarctica around 160million years ago, {{followed by the}} Indian subcontinent, in the <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with marsupial fauna and an extensive temperate rainforest.|$|E
25|$|The <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> period - the Cenomanian- {{is in the}} {{relatively}} low areas (l'Houmeau, the heights of Saint-Cybard, Sillac), at an average altitude of 50m.|$|R
50|$|The Rabekke Formation is a {{geological}} formation {{dating to the}} Latest Jurassic or <b>Earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> around 146 to 145 million years ago. It is {{on the island of}} Bornholm, Denmark. Vertebrate fossils have been found in the formation.|$|R
50|$|The Mayroubian (from {{the type}} site Mayrouba) is {{a culture of}} the Lebanese Stone Age. Archaeological sites of this culture occur in the <b>earliest,</b> <b>cretaceous,</b> {{sandstone}} layer at altitudes of over 1000 m in the districts of Meten, Chouf and Kesrouan.|$|R
5|$|All known fossil {{material}} of A. longicervia originates from the Jianshangou Formation in Beipiao, western Liaoning, China. These <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> beds constitute {{the lower part}} of the Yixian Formation, which is dated at 124.6 million years old. Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus sibiricus was {{described}} in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin {{on the basis of}} a bone, later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal, from the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Buryatia, Russia. It was transferred to Chilantaisaurus in 1990, but is now considered a nomen dubium indeterminate beyond Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> and {{the ongoing}} breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were {{becoming}} strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, iguanodontians, and brachiosaurids through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods, and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods, and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like Psittacosaurus became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, hypsilophodonts, and iguanodontians. The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct {{at some point in}} the late <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> or early late Cretaceous. A major change in the <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> which would be amplified in the late Cretaceous, was the evolution of flowering plants. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids. Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus.|$|E
50|$|Some rifts show {{a complex}} and {{prolonged}} history of rifting, with several distinct phases. The North Sea rift shows evidence of several separate rift phases from the Permian through to the <b>Earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> a period of over 100 million years.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the hesperornitheans are {{recognized}} as a very specialized lineage that is not ancestral or otherwise closely related to birds. Still, their relationship is close enough that they probably diverged from the ancestors of modern birds {{as late as the}} <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aspidostephanus is an extinct {{cephalopod}} genus {{belonging to}} the ammonite subclass, included in the perisphinctacean family Olcostephanidae that lived during the <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> and possible latest Jurassic. Fossils of the genus {{have been found in}} France, the Balearics, North Africa, and Argentina.|$|R
5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) members of the group. Although their fossils are {{relatively}} rare and their group small in numbers, they lived across all continents except Australia and Antarctica for approximately 100 million years, from the Late Triassic to the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx {{lived in}} what is now northeastern China during the <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> period. It was among the first dinosaurs {{discovered}} from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, and {{was a member of the}} Jehol Biota. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of its biology, such as its diet and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The area {{inhabited}} by A. longicervia {{is thought to}} have experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> ranging from arid or semi-arid to more humid conditions. The substrate in the region was mostly composed of lacustrine sediments and volcanic rocks.|$|E
5000|$|Pinheirodontidae is {{a poorly}} known family of fossil mammals within the order Multituberculata. Remains are {{known from the}} Late Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of Europe, (predominantly Portugal and Spain), but are so far {{restricted}} to teeth. These small plant-eaters lived during the [...] "age of the dinosaurs". They're part of the informal suborder [...] "Plagiaulacida".|$|R
5000|$|Lytoceras, {{the type}} genus, ranges from Early Jurassic to <b>early</b> late <b>Cretaceous.</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the success of the North Sea basin as a major oil province is the presence of the thick succession of marine mudstones of Late Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> age. This succession, which comes under various stratigraphic guises (Figs 1, 2), is generally accepted to have been the source of muc...|$|R
5|$|Coria and Salgado {{suggested}} that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could {{have been linked to}} common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (Carcharodontosaurus), North America (Acrocanthosaurus), and South America (Giganotosaurus), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which Giganotosaurus belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the apex (top) predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus have been {{recovered}} from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.|$|E
50|$|The Kootenay Group, {{originally}} {{called the}} Kootenay Formation, is a geologic unit of latest Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> {{age in the}} Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that {{is present in the}} mountains and foothills of southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Alberta. It includes economically important deposits of high-rank bituminous and semi-anthracite coal, as well as plant fossils and dinosaur trackways.|$|R
50|$|The Mist Mountain Formation is a latest Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> {{geologic}} {{formation in the}} Western Canada Sedimentary Basin of southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Alberta. It was named for outcrops along a western spur of Mist Mountain in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta. It contains economically important coal reserves that are mined in southeastern British Columbia.|$|R
5000|$|Late Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> extensional {{tectonics}} - led to fault-block rotations and {{formation of}} major structural traps within and {{adjacent to the}} Viking and Central Grabens. In contrast to areas west of Shetland, the phase of extensional basin development {{was followed by a}} phase of post-rift thermal subsidence in the North Sea during the later Cretaceous and Cenozoic.|$|R
5|$|Other dinosaurs of the La Amarga Formation {{include the}} {{stegosaur}} Amargastegos; predatory dinosaurs include the small ceratosaur Ligabueino, {{and the presence}} of a large tetanuran is indicated by teeth. Other than dinosaurs, the formation is notable for the cladotherian mammal Vincelestes, the only mammal known from the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> of South America. Crocodylomorphs are represented by the trematochampsid Amargasuchus– the holotype of this genus was found in association with the Amargasaurus bones.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{are known}} to have been eaten by theropods. In the 1 July 2004 edition of Nature, {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut discusses an <b>early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> fossil of three cervical vertebrae of a pterosaur with the broken tooth of a spinosaur, most likely Irritator, embedded in it. The vertebrae are known not to have been eaten and exposed to digestion, as the joints are still articulated.|$|E
5|$|Sauropelta {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} known nodosaurids. All specimens of S. edwardsorum were recovered from the Little Sheep Mudstone section of the Cloverly Formation in Wyoming and Montana, which has been dated to 108.5 million years ago, during the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous.</b> Sauropelta lived in wide floodplains around rivers that drained into the shallow inland sea to the north and east, carrying sediment eroded from the low mountains to the west. Periodic flooding of these rivers covered the surrounding plains with new muddy sediments, creating the Cloverly Formation and burying the remains of many animals, some of which would be fossilized. At the end of Cloverly times, the shallow sea would expand to cover the entire region and would eventually split North America completely in half, forming the Western Interior Seaway. Abundant fossil remains of coniferous trees suggest that these plains were covered in forests. Grasses would not evolve until later in the Cretaceous, so Sauropelta and other <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> dinosaurian herbivores browsed from a variety of conifers and cycads. Nodosaurids like Sauropelta had narrow snouts, an adaptation seen today in animals that are selective browsers as opposed to the wide muzzles of grazers.|$|E
50|$|Triconodons type {{specimen}} is BMNH 47764, a single mandible {{found in the}} Purbeck Group, England. Since then, several other specimens {{have been found in}} this region, mostly represented by skulls and jaws, making it the most common mammal fossils in this area of Britain. These deposits date to the <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> to the Berriasian at around 145-140 million years of age.|$|R
50|$|Alsasuacaris nostradamus {{was found}} in late Albian to <b>early</b> Cenomanian (<b>Cretaceous)</b> rocks near Alsasua (Navarre, Spain).|$|R
50|$|Eolambia is a genus of herbivorous iguanodontian dinosaur {{from the}} <b>early</b> Late <b>Cretaceous</b> Epoch of the USA.|$|R
5|$|The {{field is}} formed {{on top of}} {{plutonic}} rocks, which were scoured by glaciation. At the south coast of Tierra del Fuego, volcanic activity provided the late Jurassic formation known as the Lemaire Formation. Later, during the Cretaceous, the Yaghan Formation consisting of marine sediments was deposed {{on top of the}} Lemaire Formation. The basement of Fueguino consists of an ophiolite of Late Jurassic to <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> age. The ophiolitic sequence contains pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, titanomagnetite, cubanite and pyrite.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, the Zarqa River {{is about}} 30 million years old. At the river's origin is 'Ain Ghazal, a major archaeological site {{that dates back}} to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river {{indicate}} the area was rich in flora and fauna in the past. The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> (135 m.y.). A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E
5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the <b>Early</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin of Alberta and British Columbia hosts major {{deposits}} of bituminous coal that formed in swamps {{along the western}} margin of the Western Interior Seaway. They {{range in age from}} latest Jurassic or <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> in the Mist Mountain Formation, to Late Cretaceous in the Gates Formation. The Intermontane and Insular Coalfields of British Columbia also contain {{deposits of}} Cretaceous bituminous coal.|$|R
50|$|The Minnes Group, {{originally}} {{named the}} Minnes Formation, is a geologic unit of latest Jurassic to <b>earliest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> {{age in the}} Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. It {{is present in the}} northern foothills of the Canadian Rockies and the adjacent plains in northeastern British Columbia and west-central Alberta. Its strata include natural gas reservoirs and minor coal deposits. Fossil dinosaur tracks have been described from one of its formations.|$|R
50|$|Yunganglong {{cannot be}} {{directly}} compared {{with three other}} non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroids. These include Shuangmiaosaurus from the <b>early</b> Late <b>Cretaceous</b> of Liaoning Province of northeastern China, and two other <b>early</b> Late <b>Cretaceous</b> taxa from North America: the Cenomanian Protohadros and the Turonian Jeyawati. Like other hadrosauroids, Yunganglong was a ground-dwelling herbivore that could walk bipedally, and could stand on all four legs. The skull of Yunganglong is relatively wide and low.|$|R
