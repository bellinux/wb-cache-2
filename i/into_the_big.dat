The university had its first paid coach in Vernon L. Parrington, who led the Sooners to a record of ninewins, oneloss, and twoties over four seasons. Bennie Owen brought Oklahoma to the national stage during his 22-year tenure as head coach. He retired with a 122–54–16 record, including four seasons in which the team went unbeaten. During Owen's tenure, Oklahoma became a charter member of the Southwest Conference, in which they remained for fiveyears before leaving to join the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association.

5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Lee Smith {{was born}} in Jamestown, Louisiana, {{and raised in the}} small town of Castor in Bienville Parish. Buck O'Neil claimed credit for having scouted him. At age 17, partly on O'Neil's recommendation, Smith was drafted in the second round as the 28th overall pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 draft. Smith began his {{professional}} career as a starting pitcher. In 1978 with the Class AA minor league Midland Cubs, Smith struggled as a starter with an ERA near 6.00, prompting manager Randy Hundley to move him to the bullpen. Smith resisted the move and briefly tried college basketball at Northwestern State University. At the behest of former Cubs outfielder Billy Williams, Smith returned to Midland as a reliever for the 1979 season and pitched well enough to earn a promotion to Class AAA baseball for 1980. With the major league Chicago Cubs struggling to a last-place finish, Smith came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> leagues as a September call-up that season.|$|E

25|$|An example can {{be found}} in {{personality}} or temperament models.

This is by contrast to models of 'personality types' or temperament, where some have a certain type and some do not. Similarly, in the classification of mental disorders, a dimensional approach, which is being considered for the DSM-V, would involve everyone having a score on personality trait measures. A categorical approach would only look for {{the presence or absence of}} certain clusters of symptoms, perhaps with some cut-off points for severity for some symptoms only, and as a result diagnose some people with personality disorders.|$|E

The LNER added a station at Roding Valley in 1936 to serve a housing development. Most of the route transferred to the Central line of the London Transport Executive (LTE) during 1947 and 1948 {{as part of the}} war-delayed New Works Programme. The transfer brought fourth-rail electrification to replace steam and construction of a deep-level line connecting Leytonstone on the Ongar branch with Newbury Park on the loop, together with severing connections between Newbury Park and Ilford and Seven Kings.|$|E
