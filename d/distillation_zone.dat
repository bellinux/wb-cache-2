30|$|Generally {{forward and}} reverse {{combustion}} approaches {{are used in}} shaftless type UCG process. In the practical operations, reverse combustion was widely applied to link the injection and production wells in UCG (Blinderman et al. 2007), but was seldom used to gasify coal. Forward combustion has been usually applied to gasify the coal seam with appropriate gasification agents (Skafa 1960; Blinderman et al. 2007). When the flame gradually moved to the product borehole in the late stage of FCG, the huge cavity should be formed in the coal seam due to coal combustion gasification and overburden roof spalling. It made coal gasification efficiency reduce {{and the quality of}} production gas decrease. The high intensity forward gasification process would be difficult to be continued. The reasons are as follows (Yang et al. 2008): (1) The dry <b>distillation</b> <b>zone</b> becomes shorter and shorter in the later forward gasification. (2) The reaction activity of coal significantly decays after coal seams underwent dry distillation during forward gasification. (3) The reaction rates of coal combustion and gasification fell for descending concentration of gasification agents absorbed on coal surfaces of the cavity wall. To make coal seams further gasify and enhance syngas quality, the injection borehole and product borehole should be exchanged in practical operation. Then coal seams will be continued to gasify by shifting the direction of injection gas. New gasification conditions formed again. If the gasification flame moved to the direction of injection gas flow, therefore the residual coal seams around former product borehole would not be gasified. It is the waste for coal resource. In order to keep on gasifying residual dried and distilled zone, and solve the problem of the late stage of FCG, the reverse combustion gasification could be applied in UCG process. To research the feasibility and characteristics of the RCG approach, gasification experiments were performed in a system of UCG to simulate the FCG and RCG processes.|$|E

40|$|The Succinonitrile (SCN) Purification Facility {{provides}} succinonitrile and succinonitrile alloys {{to several}} NRA selected investigations for flight and ground research {{at various levels}} of purity. The purification process employed includes both <b>distillation</b> and <b>zone</b> refining. Once the appropriate purification process is completed, samples are characterized to determine the liquidus and/or solidus temperature, which is then related to sample purity. The lab has various methods for measuring these temperatures with accuracies in the milliKelvin to tenths of milliKelvin range. The ultra-pure SCN produced in our facility is indistinguishable from the standard material provided by NIST to well within the stated +/- 1. 5 mK of the NIST triple point cells. In addition to delivering material to various investigations, our current activities include process improvement, characterization of impurities and triple point cell design and development. The purification process is being evaluated {{for each of the}} four vendors to determine the efficacy of each purification step. We are also collecting samples of the remainder from <b>distillation</b> and <b>zone</b> refining for analysis of the constituent impurities.

At the exit of the gasification channel, the volatile {{composition of the}} syngas consists mostly of CO, H 2, and CH 4. The UCG process can also have other products, including H 2 S, As, Hg, Pb, and ash [27, 29, 30]. The composition of syngas is highly dependent on the gasification agent, air injection method, and coal composition [31, 32]. During operation, the three gasification zones move along {{the direction of the}} air flow, ensuring continuous gasification reactions [21]. A distinguishing feature of UCG, compared to surface gasification, is that drying, pyrolysis, and char gasification occur simultaneously within the coal [26].|$|R

Using the refined Cd and Te as starting materials, extremely high-purity CdTe single crystals were prepared by the traditional vertical THM. The nature of the defects involved in the transitions was studied by analyzing the position of the energy levels by TSC method. The resolution of 4. 2 keV (FWHM) confirms the high quality and stability of the detectors: TSC spectrum was in coherence with detectors spectrum with a horizontal plate between 0. 2 and 0. 6 eV. The enhancement in resolution of detectors with a full width at half- maximum (less than 0. 31 meV), lead to confirm that the combination of vacuum <b>distillation</b> and <b>zone</b> refining was very effective to obtain more purified CdTe single crystals for photovoltaic or nuclear detectors with better physical properties...|$|R

In 2011, SRNL adapted the technology {{for the removal of}} fluoride from fluoride-bearing salts. The method involved an in situ reaction between potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the fluoride salt to yield potassium fluoride (KF) and the corresponding oxide. The KF and excess KOH can be distilled below 1000 {deg}C using vacuum salt distillation (VSD).

40|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} of chloride salts from {{plutonium oxide}} (PuO{sub 2 }) and simulant PuO{sub 2 } {{has been previously}} demonstrated at Department of Energy (DOE) sites using kilogram quantities of chloride salt. The apparatus for vacuum <b>distillation</b> contains a <b>zone</b> heated using a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air.

Volatile salts distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile materials in the feed boat. The application of vacuum salt distillation (VSD) is {{of interest to the}} HB-Line Facility and the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Both facilities are involved in efforts to disposition excess fissile materials. Many of these materials contain chloride and fluoride salt concentrations which make them unsuitable for dissolution without prior removal of the chloride and fluoride salts. Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed a system for the distillation of chloride salts. Subsequent efforts are attempting to adapt the technology for the removal of fluoride. Fluoride salts of interest are less-volatile than the corresponding chloride salts. Consequently, an alternate approach is required for the removal of fluoride without significantly increasing the operating temperature. HB-Line Engineering requested SRNL to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of an alternate approach using both non-radioactive simulants and plutonium-bearing materials. Whereas the earlier developments targeted the removal of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl), the current activities are concerned with the removal of the halide ions associated with plutonium trifluoride (PuF{sub 3 }), plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF{sub 4 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }). This report discusses non-radioactive testing of small-scale and pilot-scale systems and radioactive testing of a small-scale system. Experiments focused on demonstrating the chemistry for halide removal and addressing the primary engineering questions associated with a change in the process chemistry...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis falls into four major divisions. Firstly, it {{is concerned with the}} preparation of large, single crystals of rare-earth halides and mixed halides of rare-earth and alkali metals. Secondly, it describes the discovery of new magnetic materials, which incorporate rare earth ions, by means of thermal and X-ray analysis of a number of mixed halide systems. Thirdly, the results of the measurements of A. C. magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of some rare-earth trichlorides are presented. Finally, crystallographic studies of some rare-earth and Group III B compounds are described. In the first part, the preparation and purification of rare-earth chloride and bromides, and the method used to grow both pure and doped single crystals for various physical measurements are discussed in detail. A very large number of crystals have been grown by the Bridgman-Stockbarger method, and have been used for physical measurements of various types, not only in the laboratory, but also in France and the U. S. A. It has been found that, to prepare optically clear crystals of mixed rare-earth chloride-alkali metal chloride compounds, the starting materials must be of very high purity. The methods of purification used were either <b>distillation</b> or <b>zone</b> refining. An investigation of phase systems containing sodium fluoride and praseodymium or terbium tetrafluorides showed that compounds of the formula NaMF 5, Na 2 MF 6 and Na 3 MF 7 were formed, but none of these were thermally stable; and therefore could not be grown as single crystals from the melt. The phase diagram of the system LiCl/YCl 3 showed the presence of a congruently melting compound Li 3 YCl, which has since been grown as a single crystal, both pure and doped with 10 % Er 3 +. An extension of previous work on materials similar to elpasolite, K 2 NaAlF 6, revealed the existence of isomorphous compounds CS 2 KMCl 6, where M is any trivalent rare earth or yttrium. In these compounds the rare earth ion occupies a site of cubic symmetry. A single crystal of CS 2 KYCl 6 has been grown from zone-refined materials. Several phase diagrams of systems containing two rare-earth chlorides of different crystallographic structures have been constructed. The mutual solubilities of several rare-earth chlorides were determined. The dimorphism of TbCl 3, DyCl 3 and HoCl 3 was investigated by differential thermal analysis. The transition temperature of TbCL 3 was found to be 535 Â°C, and that of DyCl 3, to be 350 Â°C. The latter transition was never observed directly, but could be inferred from other data. DyCl 3, in the purely low temperature form could not be made, but the transformation was found to be aided by high pressure. The transition temperature of HoCl 3 was estimated to be about 160 Â°C, but was never observed. Techniques for handling the hygroscopic rare earth halides were evolved, and methods of shaping and orienting single crystal fragments for various types of physical experiments are described. In addition various forms of container used to transfer the sample from a drybox to a cryostat are shown. Measurements of the A. C. susceptibility of DyCl 3 and HoCl 3 at low temperatures are described, but a full interpretation of the phenomena was not possible. The specific heats of DyCl 3. HoCl 3 and ErCl 3 were measured at temperatures in the liquid He 3 temperature range. At the start of this work, the low temperature crystallographic form of TbCl 3 had not been fully characterised. The crystal structure was published while work on the structure was still in progress, and the author's results agree with the published results within experimental error. The positions of the rare-earth ions in Li 3 YCl 6 and CeCl 3. 7 H 2 O were determined from Patterson syntheses. The unit cell size and symmetry of GdBr 3 was also determined. Several Group III B. compounds were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, in order to determine their unit cell size and symmetry. The only compound of possible interest as a host lattice for rare-earths, appears to be In(SCN) 3 which possesses cubic symmetry. </p...|$|R
