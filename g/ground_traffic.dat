5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy <b>ground</b> <b>traffic</b> taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E

2500|$|The NTSB's {{investigation}} of the crash revealed a failing system {{in the air and}} <b>ground</b> <b>traffic</b> control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning {{at the time of the}} incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff.

2500|$|As {{early as}} March 2007 {{it was decided}} to {{strengthen}} the Waibaidu bridge due to [...] "concerns that construction of a nearby tunnel could damage the structure.

Concerning the theoretical study, a method of estimating the induced stresses of <b>ground</b> by <b>traffic</b> loads is proposed.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on Internet traffic classification has pro-duced {{a number of}} approaches for distinguishing types of traffic. However, a rigorous comparison of such proposed algorithms still remains a challenge, since every proposal considers a different benchmark for its experimental evalua-tion. A lack of clear consensus on an objective and scientific way for comparing results has made researchers uncertain of fundamental as well as relative contributions and limi-tations of each proposal. In response to the growing ne-cessity for an objective method of comparing traffic clas-sifiers and {{to shed light on}} scientifically <b>grounded</b> <b>traffic</b> classification research, we introduce an Internet traffic clas-sification benchmark tool, NeTraMark. Based on six de-sign guidelines (Comparability, Reproducibility, Efficiency, Extensibility, Synergy, and Flexibility/Ease-of-use), NeTra-Mark is the first Internet traffic classification benchmark where eleven different state-of-the-art traffic classifiers are integrated. NeTraMark allows researchers and practition-ers to easily extend it with new classification algorithms and compare them with other built-in classifiers, in terms of three categories of performance metrics: per-whole-trace flow accuracy, per-application flow accuracy, and computa-tional performance...|$|R

50|$|A run-up {{area is a}} {{location}} at an airport where pilots can perform run-up checks of their aircraft. They exist because air blast from engine verification may cause problems for other aircraft or structures, and so a special area where such checks will do no harm is set aside for them. They also allow aircraft to temporarily leave taxiways so that they don't obstruct <b>ground</b> <b>traffic</b> while the run-up is performed. For these reasons, run-up areas are typically located near runways.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} that when these low {{visibility}} operations are taking place, operations on the ground affect operations in the air much more than in good visibility, when pilots can see what is happening.

In short, very low visibility operations such as autoland can only be conducted when aircraft, crews, ground equipment and air and <b>ground</b> <b>traffic</b> control all comply with more stringent requirements than normal.|$|E
