Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp.

The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

5|$|There are {{situations}} in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in the propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> section below, many wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays through most glasses can routinely exceed c, but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{produced at}} least three distinct proteases <b>in</b> <b>a</b> synthetic <b>medium</b> containing calcium.

The production of these proteases depended on Ca 2 + but not on Zn 2 + in the medium. Alpha-toxin, perhaps being a zinc-containing metalloenzyme, was rather resistant to the proteases, but toxin, produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zinc-deficient <b>medium</b> or deprived of zinc with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt, was very sensitive. By adding Zn 2 +, the toxin lacking zinc may have been converted to the zinc-containing metalloprotein that is resistant to proteases.

25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> with low permittivity than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> with high permittivity. Thus, permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest).|$|E
