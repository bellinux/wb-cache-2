5000|$|The Comecon {{was founded}} in 1949 by the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland had remained interested in Marshall aid despite the requirements for a convertible currency and market economies. These requirements, which would inevitably have resulted in stronger economic ties to free European markets than to the Soviet Union, were absolutely unacceptable to Stalin, who in July 1947, ordered these communist-dominated governments {{to pull out of the}} Paris Conference on the <b>European</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme.</b> This has been described as [...] "the moment of truth" [...] in the post-World War II division of Europe.

A pragmatic version focusing on net public investment as defined in the national accounts minus military expenditures plus investment grants for the private sector could quickly be implemented. Net public investment should be deducted from the relevant deficit measures of the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal compact. Over time it could be technically and statistically refined and potentially include other – more intangible – types of investment like education expenditures. As political implementation would probably take some time, the golden rule would have to be complemented by expansionary fiscal policy to provide the urgently needed boost to the European economy in the short term. This could be done by a short term European Investment Programme similar to the 2008 <b>European</b> Economic <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> during the Great Recession.

40|$|In August 1947 the British Treasury {{imposed a}} {{substantial}} tax on film imports, to conserve {{dollars for the}} purchase of essential goods from abroad. In response, the American film industry stopped exporting its product to Britain, and the US Embassy began lobbying vigorously against the tax. American diplomats wanted to promote free trade and feared that the US film industry might disseminate propaganda against <b>European</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> aid planned for Britain. The tax was repealed in March 1948 partly due to Embassy protests, but the British authorities rejected the concerns of US diplomats over the subsequent quota system because of the seemingly greater importance of bolstering the indigenous film industry. This article examines the controversy over British film Policy 1947 - 1948 and offers fresh insights into the Anglo-American ?special relationship? and diplomatic representation in an era of growing US economic and cultural dominance. Among other things, it notes that what appears to be on the surface a relatively minor issue can have much broader implications...|$|E
40|$|PhDThis thesis studies how {{attempts}} {{to carry out}} the policy of economic planning outlined in the Labour Party's 1945 manifesto failed during the Attlee Governments 1945 - 51. It considers the structure of the civil service and ministerial machinery created to oversee planning and the changes made to it. It covers the debate among officials and ministers over what planning meant and which economic tools could be used to implement it. In particular the thesis focuses on the most tangible manifestations of the planning policies: the annual economic surveys and the Long-Term Programme drawn up as part of the <b>European</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> process. The thesis seeks to gauge how far planning added "value" to the economy or the workings of the Civil Service. It asks whether the new planning bodies fitted successfully into Whitehall and if British government was sufficiently adaptable to the new economic challenges it faced. It questions the extent to which planners were able to foresee the economic problems Britain encountered and consequently whether ministers were able to successfully combat them. The thesis also seeks to assess the power of initiative of leading civil servants. Furthermore it investigates when planning was superseded by Keynesian demand management and how far planning was in fact incompatible with the capitalist British economy. Overall this thesis demonstrates how planning, an important economic policy, failed to be implemented in the immediate post-war years...|$|E

40|$|This {{study had}} three aims. First to {{determine}} whether those children entering the Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme</b> were deficient in phonological processing ability. Secondly, {{to see whether the}} Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> provided for the adequate development of phonological processing strategies, and thirdly, to ascertain whether a Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme,</b> modified to include systematic training in phonological processing strategies, would be more effective. Sixty four First grade children identified as being the lowest scorers on the Diagnostic Survey (Clay), and the Dolch Word Test, were given either a standard Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme</b> or a Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme</b> modified to include systematic training in phonological processing strategies. Each child was matched on the basis of his/her scores on letter identification and dictation with a child frorn the other group, and with a child for whom no Reading Recovery was available, but who was receiving a standard intervention programme. Three tests measuring phonological processing ability were also administered pre and post-treatment, {{and at the end of}} the year. At the end of each child's programme an average child from the same classroom was also tested. The results supported the evidence that children experiencing difficulty in reading may be particularly deficient in phonological processing strategies. The results also confirmed the evidence that the Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme</b> is very effective in bringing nearly all of the lowest scoring children up to average levels of performance in reading and writing in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, those children receiving the modified Reading <b>Recovery</b> <b>programme</b> reached the criteria for discontinuation (that is, they had acquired a set of strategies that would enable them to continue to learn to read as they read increasingly more difficult material), in significantly fewer lessons. Thus it would appear, for children experiencing difficulty in reading, the teaching of phonological processing strategies that make explicit the relationship not only between sounds and letters but also letters and sounds, increases the rate of learning. The type of educational setting that this teaching should take place in is discussed, as are the implications of such learning in relation to the child's growing control over the reading process...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Marshall Plan on the British Labour government and the trade union movement. It argues that the British government was able to 'manage' relations with the US in terms of limiting unwanted US influence, while restructuring relations with its domestic support base. in this way, the British government was able to play what Putnam has referred to as a two-level game, satisfying demands at both the national and international levels. The Marshall Plan provides evidence of how, as Putnam explains, 'central decision-makers strive to reconcile domestic and international imperatives simultaneously'. By drawing on TUC archives it shows how the government and the leadership of the TUC used the Marshall Plan to realign the unions and increase their control over the labour movement. The study rejects arguments that the Labour government was forced to change its policies because of the Marshall Plan. Instead it shows that the Labour government used American pressure to persuade its own constituents of the value of its policies. The government and trade union leaderships were able control those on the left through an anti-communist campaign while removing communists from positions of authority. Through its role in the establishment of an anti-communist, pro-Marshall Plan international trade union body, the British Trades Union Congress weakened the left's source of external support. The establishment of a network of pro-Marshall Plan organisations such as the <b>European</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> Trade Union Advisory Committee and the Anglo-American Council on Productivity, helped the trade union leadership to delineate the parameters of debate and to assure the longer-term marginalisation of the far left...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{analytical}} {{study of the}} structure and activities of the International Transport Workers' Federation(ITF) from 1945 to 1965. It gives {{particular attention to the}} nature of the ITF's memberships, especially its expansion to the United States and to the Third World; to the ITF's political stance in a period of enormous international tension and to the interrelationship of both those factors. The ITF was founded in 1896 and there are few substantial transport workers' unions which are not yet affiliated. It has long been recognized as the most effective of all the international trade union organizations. The ITF made a significant contribution to the Allied war effort in the Second World War and its membership in every branch of the international transport industry took on great strategic importance during the Cold War. The thesis is based on original research, making special use of the ITF's extensive archives at the Modern Records Centre of the University of Warwick. There is a close and critical focus on the ITFs political engagement, exemplified by its controversial part in countering communist influence in European ports in the early 1950 s at the time of the introduction of the <b>European</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Programme</b> (the Marshall Plan). This discussion is, however, set in the context of the ITF's structures and its broader social and industrial concerns, such as the defence of trade union and civil rights and assistance to transport workers' unions in the newly de-colonized developing countries. The conclusions draw out the main findings of the research and discuss the dearth of academic literature on the international trade union movement, and especially the almost total neglect of 'International Trade Secretariats', organizations such as the ITF which group together national trade unions in specific industries and services. On this basis, it surveys a poorly served theoretical field and outlines implications for future theoretical analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
