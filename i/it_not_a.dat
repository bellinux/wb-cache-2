25|$|Unlike some {{breaches}} of Law 41, a No ball only {{attracts the}} No ball penalty (e.g. one run), {{there are no}} provisions in the Law or in common regulations for five penalty runs to be awarded to the batting team, {{and there are no}} incidents when five penalty runs are awarded that would require a No ball to be called, although scenarios exist in which five penalty runs might be awarded when the ball is in play and would count in the over, were <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> No ball for the reasons given here, for example: repeated damage to the wicket by the fielding team during a No ball, or the ball hits a helmet on the ground during a No ball.|$|E
25|$|The House of Breath {{is a novel}} {{written by}} the American author William Goyen. It was his first book, {{published}} in 1950. It is not a novel in the usual sense in that it lacks traditional plot and character development. Upon its publication, reviewers noted the book for its unusual literary technique and style. Goyen called it a series of “arias”. Some critics have called <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> novel at all but a work to be read as poetry, over and over. The book touches on themes of family (kinship), human sexuality, place, time, and memory. It received critical acclaim upon its publication, not commercial success, but it did lead the way for support of the author’s further work through fellowships.|$|E

2500|$|I have to {{say that}} there are moments when I wonder — moments when its two senior networks, first set up as a partnership, {{schedule}} simultaneously programmes of identical character, thereby contradicting the very reason that the BBC was given a second network. Then there are times when both BBC One and BBC Two, intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre, allow that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules. The result is that other kinds of programmes are not placed, simply because of a lack of space. Do we really require so many gardening programmes, make-over programmes or celebrity chefs? Is <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> scandal in this day and age, that there seems to be no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or thoughtful in-depth interviews with people other than politicians? ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, when asked whether Kirito's personality and character were based off his own, the author responded {{that he does not}} usually put aspects of himself into his characters, and jokingly remarked that [...] "but if I had to say there was a point of similarity between Kirito and myself, it is the fact that neither of us are good at forming parties. We [...] tend to play solo in these games a lot." [...] He also added that he wrote the series to change popular opinion of online gaming; viewing <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> social ill or just an escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. When fans asked him about Kirito using a sword in a gun-based game, Kawahara responded that the energy sword in Halo can be the most powerful weapon if used properly.|$|E

2500|$|Williams now had routeing, {{scheduling}} and tactics {{down to a}} fine art. Not one pilot failed to follow the simple, well marked course correctly. In some areas smoke obscured the visual aids but the Eureka beacons worked faultlessly. The major innovation {{was the use of}} double-tow, whereby a C-47 towed two gliders instead of one, thereby increasing the glider lift by 50%. The IX Troop Carrier Command had practiced the technique over the previous months and found <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> difficult as had been feared. The problem of the reduced range of a C-47 towing two gliders was eliminated by using bases in the Paris area instead of in England. The combination of the two divisions in one lift made this the largest single day airborne drop in history. General Brereton rated Operation VARSITY a [...] "tremendous success." [...] But the cost was not light: seven British and 46 American aircraft were lost. The flammability of the C-46 caused an unacceptable loss rate of 28%. Williams returned to the United States in July 1945. He remained in command of the IX Troop Carrier Command, which moved to Stout Air Force Base, Indiana.|$|E
