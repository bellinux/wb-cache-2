40|$|After the 80 ’s, a lot {{of central}} banks have shifted from the {{evolution}} of the monetary aggregates towards inflation targeting, case in which have been eliminated the intermediate objectives of the monetary policy. Hereby, in the 90 ’s, the growing preoccupation for ensuring price stability as a premise for long-term economic growth has materialized in the adoption of the central banks from many countries of a new monetary policy strategy. <b>Direct</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> Initially, the strategy has been adopted by some countries with a developed economy. <b>Direct</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> has become after the crises from Latin America and Asia, an attractive alternative also for the emerging economies. Romania is the 22 nd country that has adopted the <b>direct</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> strategy. For now, NBR considers the inflation targeting as being the adequate medium-term monetary policy framework, leading in the same time at the increase of independence and credibility. This monetary policy strategy is applied in Romania starting from 2005, until, introducing the Exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) The exchange rate policy will still remain the controlled floating. Although the exchange rate will play a stronger role in reducing inflation, NBR has reduced its interventions, leaving the foreign currency market to find the equilibrium level for the exchange rate. After the moment of introducing the ERM II, the maintaining of the <b>direct</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> strategy is probable or is possible to pass at an exchange rate targeting strategy.

It examines the effect {{of changes in the}} two-week repo rate (the official interest rate) on short and long–term market interest rates. It assumes the asymmetry of information and the existence of a stationary stochastic equilibrium with full knowledge of authorities reaction function. We find that at short maturities, the coefficients for changes in the official repo rate are lower in the DIT period than in the pre-crisis period. This implies that the hypothesis of no increase in the transparency of monetary policy with the introduction of DIT can be rejected. We find that bond yields and interest rate swap rates with maturities of 5 years and longer did not react significantly to official interest rate decisions in the DIT period. This is consistent with the hypothesis that monetary policy was credible both before and after introduction of DIT.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the P* model is tested as an inflation forecaster for the Spanish economy. It is shown that log-run relationships work as expected according to the model and the Quantitative Theory of Money. The Error Correction Model constructed by using the gap between actual prices and the long-term equilibrium price level as an error correction term, offers a consistent explanation for the short-run dynamics in prices. On the other hand, the P* approach shows a forecasting ability similar to that presented for other countries in several studies, although the degree of accuracy in the prediction is not specially satisfactory, mainly for the period 1989 : 3 - 1992 : 3, when the credibility effect generated by {{the inclusion of the}} Spanish peseta in the European Monetary System led to an inflation rate much lower than that predicted by the model.
