After careful {{consideration of the}} exposure environment in a microelectronic plant and {{the recognition of the}} critical exposure situation it was possible to introduce several improvements that led to measurable {{decrease in the number of}} chromosomal aberrations observed in lymphocytes. In the group of workers performing <b>final</b> <b>chlorination</b> of polyvinylchloride it could be shown that the DNA-adducts were the most sensitive parameter. In contrast, in the case of workers engaged in the synthesis of ethers chromosomal damage was determinated to be the most sensitive one.

Samples were obtained at each level of treatment: raw water, postchlorination, postsedimentation, postfiltration, postozonation, and finished (tap) water. Raw water quality was usually poor, with total coliform counts exceeding 105 to 106 CFU/liter and the average virus count in raw water of 3. 3 most probable number of cytopathogenic units (MPNCU) /liter; several samples contained more than 100 MPNCU/liter. All plants distributed finished water that was essentially free of indicator bacteria as judged by analysis of 1 liter for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The total plate counts at 20 and 35 degrees C were also evaluated {{as a measure of}} the total microbial population and were usually very low.

We assessed the bacterial community structure and diversity during different treatment steps in a full-scale seawater desalination plant producing 40, 000 m 3 /d of drinking water. Water samples were taken over the full treatment train consisting of chlorination, spruce media and cartridge filters, de-chlorination, first and second pass reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and final chlorine dosage for drinking water distribution. The water samples were analyzed for water quality parameters (total bacterial cell number, total organic carbon, conductivity, pH, etc.) and microbial community composition by 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The planktonic microbial community was dominated by Proteobacteria (48. 6 %) followed by Bacteroidetes (15 %), Firmicutes (9. 3 %) and Cyanobacteria (4. 9 %). During the pretreatment step, the spruce media filter did not impact the bacterial community composition dominated by Proteobacteria. In contrast, the RO and <b>final</b> <b>chlorination</b> treatment steps reduced the Proteobacterial relative abundance in the produced water where Firmicutes constituted the most dominant bacterial group. Shannon and Chao 1 diversity indices showed that bacterial species richness and diversity decreased during the seawater desalination process.

About 0. 25 % of the total bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were present in all stages of the desalination plant: the seawater, the RO permeates and the chlorinated drinking water, suggesting that these bacterial strains can survive in different environments such as high/low salt concentration and with/without residual disinfectant.

In this work, they prompted {{the extension of}} oxidative methodology to new systems, inspired the systematic modification of the palmarumycin scaffold to produce potent thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) inhibitors, and demanded creative synthetic solutions to the structural challenges Mother Nature provided. The first pursuit was the total synthesis of parvistemonine, a pentacyclic azacycle isolated from Stemona plants. These plants {{have been used in}} Chinese folk medicine, and the isolated Stemona alkaloids possess therapeutic uses that range from antitussive to antiparasitic activity. The oxidative cyclization of tyrosine was incorporated into the syntheses of several natural products, and the extension of this methodology to homotyrosine for construction of the azacyclic core was investigated. Ultimately, the desired cyclization was not optimized to give synthetically viable yields, but the competing pathways and preferred reactivity was elucidated. In a separate project, a library of palmarumycin based prodrugs was synthesized. The bisnaphthospiroketal functionality, which is present in palmarumycin, is a lucrative scaffold that potently inhibits thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR). Some of the analogues suffered from low solubility, so various amino ester and sugar containing prodrugs were investigated. A prodrug library with improved solubility and greater plasma stability was successfully generated. One gram of the lead prodrug was needed for further biological testing, which would have been challenging with the first generation synthesis. An alternative synthesis was developed that afforded 1 g of the prodrug and decreased the total number of steps by half while significantly improving the overall yield. Finally, the total synthesis of spiroxins A and B was pursued. The spiroxins were isolated from an unidentified marine fungus and only spiroxin A was tested for biological activity. These highly oxygenated octacyclic compounds only differ in their degree of chlorination.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} project was the development and the test of a treatment technology {{on the base of}} the Elbe bankfiltrate. One of the most important parts was the registration {{of the quality of the}} bank-filtered and Elbe river water. Before testing and optimizing the technology at the pilot plant basic experiments were carried out in laboratory scale. The pilot plant is situated in the Dresden waterwork Saloppe. There are short bank passages of the Elbe water which are representative for the upper Elbe valley. The elimination of organic micropollutants requires the use of activated carbon (AC). Because of the high organic load of the bankfiltrate a pretreatment to reduce the DOC is necessary. Therefore flocculation and ozonation with biological treatment prior to activated carbon filtration were tested. In order to guarantee the THM standard the DOC has to reduce to 2, 5 mg/l before activated carbon filtration and to 2, 0 mg/l after activated carbon filtration. On that condition and the present contaminant level with organic micropollutants activated carbon should be reactivated after a specific through put of 50 m" 3 /kg AC. (AC: ROW 0, 8 S, l_f= 2 m, v_F= 10 m/h). The highest degree of DOC elimination (30 - 35 %) was obtained by optimizing flocculation in weakly acid pH range. After flocculation ozone is needed because of the bacteriological, virological and parasitic situation of the Elbe bankfiltrate. Up to DOC of raw water of 3 mg/l ozonation combined with subsequent biological treatment can be an alternative treatment to flocculation prior to activated carbon filtration. However a reliable drinking water treatment of Elbe bankfiltrate means flocculation at low pH, ozonation, activated carbon filtration and <b>final</b> <b>chlorination.</b> Further research is needed before realization biological treatment instead of flocculation in full scale.

40|$|Daugava water {{treatment}} {{is the largest}} plant in Latvia supplying about 50 % of the drinking water for Riga city (100. 000 m 3 daily). The plant takes water from River Daugava (from the reservoir of Riga hydroelectric power station). The watershed of the Riwer Daugava is largely covered with swamps (7 %) and forests (38 %); therefore, water in the river contains a high amount of humic substances (Rubulis and Juhna, 2005). Upstream the intake several villages and cities are located (in Russia, Belarusia and Latvia) therefore the raw water is influenced by wastewater discharges. To reduce the pollution risk of the drinking water in 2001 the treatment process was upgraded with two stage ozonation. Consequently, Daugava WTP is using preozonation, chemical coagulation with alum, rapid filtration, main ozonation, biologically active carbon (BAC) filtration and <b>final</b> <b>chlorination.</b> Here we present results of monitoring of natural organic matter (NOM) removal at Daugava Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and river Daugava. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the fraction and types of compounds of NOM produced and removed by the treatment processes, in particular during ozonation and biofiltration. NOM changes were investigated by BDOC measurements (according to Ribas et al., 1991), NOM-fractionation (according to Christopher et al., 2004), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and Liquid Chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD). This was undertaken in order to gain more information for optimization of NOM removal efficacy at the plant. Total organic carbon (TOC) measured in river Daugava was 12. 4 mg/l in 2006 and increased with 50 % in 2008 reaching 18. 7 mg/l. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contained 95 % of TOC. During the treatment process in Daugava WTP the DOC concentration decreased with 68 % and average result in the drinking water was 4. 99 ± 1. 92 mg-C/L in study period. Results of the analyses of water samples showed that preozonation-coagulation and filtration reduced the concentration of very hydrophobic acid fraction (VHA; humic substances/high molecular weight) whereas other fractions (biodegradable dissolved organic matter; low molecular weight acids (LMA) /hydrophilic charged acids) remained almost unchanged during the treatment process...|$|E

The isolation of enteroviruses and rotaviruses from treated drinking water In a distribution system and at a water treatment plant. This study reports the results of a more extensive investigation on the removal of naturally occurring viruses by water treatment processes including prechlorination/clarification, filtration, and chlorination at a fullscale water treatment plant. The removal of enteroviruses and rotaviruses was studied at a full scale 205 mgd water treatment plant involving chemical clarification, sand filtration and chlorination. Enteric viruses, as well as coliphages, indicator bacteria, physical and chemical variables were measured in water samples taken at each stage of the drinking water treatment facility. Linear intercorrel ations were analyzed for all the variables. The numbers of standard plate count bacteria and coliphage were positively correlated to the presence of enteroviruses in the raw water while coliphage counts were positively correlated to the presence of rotaviruses in the finished water. Samples were taken during the dry and rainy seasons. During the dry season, it was found that reduction of enteroviruses and rotaviruses averaged 81 % and 93 %, respectively, for the complete treatment process and were the least efficiently removed as compared to the other microorganisms. The greatest reduction of enterovIruses occurred during pre-chlorination/flocculation and filtration, while a significant reduction of rotav I ru ses occurred during prechlorination/ flocculation and <b>final</b> <b>chlorination.</b> Enteroviruses or rotaviruses occurred in 24 % of the finished water samples containing chlorine levels of > 0. 2 mg/L, and meeting coliform bacteria (1 / 100 ml) and turbidity (1 NTU) standards.

40|$|L'utilisation de l'ozone, aujourd'hui très répandue dans les filières de potabilisation, n'est pas sans effet secondaire. De nombreux sous-produits peuvent se former comme notamment les ions bromates, sous produits finaux d'oxydation des bromures contenus dans les eaux. Malheureusement, le mécanisme de {{production}} de cette espèce est complexe et dépend de nombreux paramètres difficiles à appréhender. Sur une installation pilote de type colonne à bulles fonctionnant à contre-courant, nous avons étudié l'influence de différents paramètres, comme le pH, {{le temps}} de contact, la dose d'ozone et la dose de peroxyde d'hydrogène, sur la formation des bromates et la dégradation des pesticides, représentée par l'atrazine. Les résultats de la littérature ont été confirmés lors de l'emploi unique de l'ozone. La formation des ions bromate est influencée par la présence du peroxyde d'hydrogène. Cet oxydant intervient de manière non négligeable sur la consommation des entités intermédiaires. Le couple HOBr/OBr- peut être oxydé par l'ozone moléculaire et le radical OH° mais peut également être réduit par l'ozone et par le peroxyde sous sa forme acide ou sa base conjuguée. En ce qui concerne la dégradation des pesticides, l'utilisation de peroxyde d'hydrogène couplé à l'ozone favorise l'oxydation de la molécule d'atrazine grâce à la présence plus importante de radicaux hydroxyles. Une pollution accidentelle en pesticides pourra être traitée par l'ajout ponctuel de peroxyde d'hydrogène avec une augmentation de pH, la formation des bromates sera, dans ce cas, faible. La désinfection sera alors assurée par l'étape de chloration. In drinking water treatment plants, ozonation {{is often used}} to disinfect, to remove micropollutants and to improve water taste and odour. Ozonation increases organic matter biodegradability before filtration through granular active carbon and reduces the concentration of haloform precursors that react in the <b>final</b> <b>chlorination</b> step. However, by-products that could be detrimental to human health could be formed. For example, bromates, which are classified as carcinogenic compounds by the I. A. R. C, are produced during the ozonation of bromide-containing water. The mechanism of bromate formation is complex, due to the participation of molecular ozone and radical (hydroxyl and carbonate) reactions. The optimisation of the process should allow for a good disinfection and a reduction in the levels of micropollutants, together with low by-product formation. Using a pilot-scale counter-current bubble column, we have measured the bromate concentration in relation to pesticide removal. Water spiked with bromide and atrazine was stored in a completely stirred-tank (2 m 3) before being pumped {{to the top of the}} column. The inlet gaseous ozone was measured by an analyser using UV detection, the outlet gaseous ozone was monitored by the potassium iodide method, and the dissolved ozone concentration was determined by the indigo trisulfonate method. Bromides and bromates were quantified by ion chromatography with a conductimetric detector, with a sodium carbonate solution as the eluant. Samples for bromate analysis were pretreated by OnGuard-Ag and OnGuard-H cartridges in series before injection. Atrazine degradation was measured by high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector, with a CH 3 CN/H 2 O mixture as the eluant. The linearisation of atrazine removal allowed us to calculate the hydroxyl radical concentration in a series of a completely-stirred tank reactors and in a plug-flow reactor. We have studied the influence of several parameters on bromate formation, including pH, bromide concentration and hydrogen peroxide concentration. As bromate production is a function of bromide concentration, we have chosen to calculate the ratio between the real bromate concentration and the theoretical bromate concentration if all bromide were oxidised to bromate. The pH affects bromate formation: an increase in pH in the absence of hydrogen peroxide increases bromate production, but when this oxidant is applied bromate production decreases when the pH increases. If reaction progress is represented as a function of [O 3]*TC, we note that the presence of hydrogen peroxide increases bromate formation because of the increase in hydroxyl radical concentration, which favours radical formation. Nevertheless, if we represent reaction progress as a function of [OH∘]*TC, hydrogen peroxide seems to be an initiator and a scavenger in the mechanism of bromate formation. If we calculate the rates of all the oxidation and reduction reactions for HOBr/OBr- species, the contribution to the reduction of HOBr/OBr- species by peroxide is very important in comparison to the oxidation reactions, which inhibits bromate production. Without the hydrogen peroxide, the contribution of oxidation is equal to that of the reduction reaction, and in this case bromate formation is effective. When, under the same initial operational conditions, we apply hydrogen peroxide with an increase in pH, we observe a decrease in bromate formation with a decrease of the dissolved ozone concentration, which hinders the desired disinfection. The main contribution to atrazine oxidation is from the free-radical reactions, which explains why removal is better when we apply hydrogen peroxide than when we use ozone alone. However, if we want to respect a low bromate level in drinking water, atrazine degradation should not be greater than 90 % for the operational conditions on our pilot-scale. If an accidental high pesticide concentration is observed, an addition of hydrogen peroxide with a concurrent increase of pH, could treat the pollution. In this case, a subsequent chlorination step would then have to be used to assure the disinfection alone...|$|E
40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (SOS chromotest, test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le SOS chromotest est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of organohalogenated compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of organohalogenated compounds and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the SOS chromotest, a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the SOS chromotest was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and tribromomethane), five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the SOS chromotest was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the SOS chromotest detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the genotoxic potency of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - <b>final</b> <b>chlorination</b> at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the ozonator (chlorinated water), 3. after the ozonator (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the SOS chromotest appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|E
