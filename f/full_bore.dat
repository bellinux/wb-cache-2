So quickly the plane came that Usanga's men had no time to escape it after they realized its menace. It touched the ground just as it struck among them and mowed through them, a veritable juggernaut of destruction. When it came to rest at the edge of the forest the ape-man leaped quickly to the ground and ran toward the young lieutenant, and as he went he glanced at the spot where the warriors had stood, ready to defend himself if necessary, but there was none there to oppose him. Dead and dying they lay strewn for fifty feet along the turf.|$|R

40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, cyclonic separators are acceptable as hydrocyclone, mist eliminators, separator internal device and compact metering package. Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using cyclonic separator for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of cyclonic separator, this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe cyclonic separator was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 downward inclined tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet. Two inlet nozzles with D–shape were used for separation enhancement. The nozzle that reduces the diameter of <b>full</b> pipe <b>bore</b> by 25 % gave slight improvement but also gave the greatest pressure drop. The nozzle that reduced the <b>full</b> pipe <b>bore</b> diameter by 50 % performed poorly...|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} extension was {{a connection between}} Afula and Jerusalem. The first 17km section was completed {{at the beginning of}} 1913 and connected Afula with Jenin. Meissner's <b>full</b> plan never <b>bore</b> fruit however, because of the French government's extreme pressure on the Ottoman government to cancel the project, which would compete with the French-owned Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. In the end, only 40km were built from Afula, and terminated near the village Silat ad-Dhahr (Sileh). This extension was later used by Meissner during World War I to continue the railway to Tulkarm and from there via the Eastern Railway to Lydda, where it connected with the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and railways to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.|$|R
