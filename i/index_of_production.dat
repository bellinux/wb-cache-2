This article analyses the information content of some ifo indicators (the business climate index for the manufacturing sector and its components, the current business situation and business expectations) to predict the German <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> The analysis is based on cross correlations, Granger causality tests and different out-of-sample forecasts, generated by ubset VAR models. First, the out-of-sample forecasts are made, as in conventional studies, with the latest available data and fixed model structure. Afterwards, the out-of-sample indicator properties are analysed in real-time, i. e. with real-time data and variable model structure. In general the indicator properties become worse under real-time conditions.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{prospects for}} 1990 appear very uncertain, following {{a year in}} which the Scottish economy has shown signs of out-performing the UK on some indicators. The <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for the second quarter of 1989 makes encouraging reading. In the year to the end of June production and construction industry output rose by 4. 5 % compared with 2. 2 % for the UK as a whole.

When the petroleum and natural gas sectors are removed, however, the relative performance is less impressive; 4. 5 % for Scotland compared with 6 % for the UK.
