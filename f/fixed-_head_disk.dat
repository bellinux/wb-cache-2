This {{is carried out}} by theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental study. The first method (amplitude detection) provides {{a simple way to}} study the <b>head</b> <b>disk</b> spacing change. The second method (PW 50 parameter estimation) can be used effectively for real-time spacing variation measurement in normally operated hard disk drives, primarily in low frequency spacing variation conditions. The third method (thermal signal detection), on the other hand, is more effective and suitable for high frequency spacing variation measurement. By combining the PW 50 estimation and thermal signal detection methods, a noval spacing variation detection method for the whole frequency range is constructed. This combined signal detection method not only has been used to study the <b>head</b> <b>disk</b> spacing variation itself, but also has the potential of being used for real time flying height control. Analytical models are developed for <b>head</b> <b>disk</b> assembly and <b>head</b> position servo control mechanisms to analyse the operation failure of hard disk drives under vibration conditions. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show their good agreement with experimental results. A novel active flying height control method is proposed to suppress the flying height or head-disk spacing variation in hard disk drives under vibration conditions. Simulation results show that this active flying height control can effectively suppress the head-disk spacing variation, therefore the performance and reliability of HDDs can be well improved when working in vibration conditions: The method has a good potential to be applied to future ruggedized hard disk drives...|$|R

Recently IBM announced its mobile product {{with the industry}} highest areal density of 2. 64 Gb/In{sup 2 }. The areal density demonstrations have shown up to 5 Gb/In{sup 2 } possible.

In budgeting this magnetic spacing, it is required that disk and slider air bearing surface overcoats thickness be reduced to 5 nm range.
