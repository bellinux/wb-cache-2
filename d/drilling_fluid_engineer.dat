"Mud engineer" [...] is {{the name}} given to an oil field service company {{individual}} who is charged with maintaining a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> or completion fluid system on an oil and/or gas drilling rig. This individual typically works for the company selling the chemicals for the job and is specifically trained with those products, though independent mud engineers are still common. The role of the mud engineer or more properly <b>Drilling</b> <b>Fluids</b> <b>Engineer</b> is very critical to the entire drilling operation because even small problems with mud can stop the whole operations on rig. The internationally accepted shift pattern at off-shore drilling operations is personnel (including mud engineers) work on a 28-day shift pattern, where they work for 28 continuous days and rest the following 28 days. In Europe this is more commonly a 21-day shift pattern.|$|R

[...] After he earned a captain’s license, Hardberger’s employer sent him to the Dresser-Magcobar <b>Drilling</b> <b>Fluids</b> School in Houston to learn how to become a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> <b>engineer,</b> also known as a “mud man.” Hardberger initially worked in oilfields off the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast and then worked as a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> consultant in Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War. Between oilfield hitches, Hardberger continued his flying lessons, earning commercial and flight instructor licenses, and took a wide variety of flying jobs, including towing banners, dusting crops, doing nightly check runs for banks and transporting dead bodies for mortuaries. [...] Hardberger also delivered aircraft to Central America. Hardberger returned to the classroom for the 1984-85 school year, when he taught English and world history at Pope John Paul II High School (Slidell, Louisiana). [...] Hardberger briefly returned to the oilfields of Guatemala in 1985, then began crop dusting on a full-time basis in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. At the end of the 1986 crop dusting season, Hardberger traveled to Miami, Florida to search for new work.|$|R

Drilling materials and additives together with drill cuttings, oil, and water constitute waste <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids,</b> which ultimately are dumped onto soil, surface water, groundwater, and air. Environmental pollution is found to be a serious threat while drilling complex wells or high-temperature deep wells as these types of wells involve the use of oil-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems and high-performance water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems. The preservation of the environment on a global level is now important as various organizations have set up initiatives to drive the usage of toxic chemicals as <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> additives. This paper presents an approach where grass is introduced as a sustainable <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> additive with no environmental problems. Simple water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> were formulated using bentonite, powdered grass, and water to analyze the rheological and filtration characteristics of the new <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> A particle size distribution test was conducted to determine the particle size of the grass sample by the sieve analysis method.

30|$|In {{high-temperature}} drilling conditions (120 and 225  °C in some cases), the oil-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are favored {{because of}} better thermal stability and being less affected by contaminants {{which results in}} faster <b>drilling.</b> Oil-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are composed of oil as the continuous phase and water as the dispersed phase in conjunction with emulsifiers, viscosity modifiers, weighting materials, and wetting agents. Organophilic clays and barite are common viscosity modifiers and weighting material, respectively. In deep drilling, due to high temperatures, polymeric surfactants degrade and phase separation occur; therefore, an emulsifier tolerant of high temperatures is needed (Coussot et al. 2004; Shah et al. 2010; Agarwal et al. 2013).

Hence, the need for <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> with exceptional heat transmission properties has become necessary as this will improve drilling operations. The heat transfer abilities of nanofluids {{are directly related to}} its thermal conductivity. Fazelabdolabadi et al.

For oil-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids,</b> the functionalized CNTs improved the thermal conductivity by 43.1 % compared to 40.3 % for the un-functionalized CNTs. William et al.

In this study, the impact of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and nano metal oxides (titanium oxide, aluminum oxide and copper oxide) on the rheological properties of water based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> were investigated. The influence of different concentrations of nanoparticles on the rheological properties of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> was investigated at room and elevated temperatures. The experimental results showed that the filtrate loss of the water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> is reduced around 65 % and mud cake thickness is reduced about 30 % in the presence of 1 g of MWCNT. Water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> with metal oxide also produced low filtrate loss. For example, water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> plus titanium oxide achieved more than 50 % reduction in fluid loss and the filter cake thickness reduced to about 30 %. Furthermore, significant improvements are seen in the rheological properties such as yield point, plastic viscosity and gel strength of the water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> with the presence of metal oxide and MWCNT. Overall, the application of nanoparticles on the rheological properties of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> delivers on great benefits...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to design}} an {{offshore}} <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance vessel to increase reuse and recycling of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids.</b> Large quantities of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are used during drilling operations and both transport and procurement of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> are expensive. By performing maintenance of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> offshore, less transportation and procurement {{of the highly}} valuable fluid are needed and thus a potential of overall cost reduction emerges. In this thesis, offshore drilling operations are studied {{in the light of}} <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance and bulk shipments. A vessel design able to perform <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore is developed and principal particulars for the vessel is presented. Economic benefits of introducing such vessel design, and current rules and regulations for reuse and recycling of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids,</b> are not discussed in this thesis. In this thesis a vessel concept develops by using the system based ship design methodology. <b>Drilling</b> operations, <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance, and platform supply vessels used to assist drilling operations as dedicated storage vessels, are analyzed to investigate the potential of implementing a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance vessel. Based on these analyses a concept design emerges. To aid in the development process of designing a vessel, a three-dimensional model and general arrangement drawings are created to visualize and validate the vessel design. An outline specification of the vessel is presented as a solution to the objective of performing <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore. This thesis proposes a vessel design able to perform <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance offshore. Contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> used in a drilling operation, is treated onboard the vessel by a <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance system. The <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance system consists of; three solids control units and one centrifuge to clean the contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> one mud-mixer to mix additives into the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid,</b> and storage tanks to store the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> and components. These systems are connected to a pump and piping system to move the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> around in the vessel. Total installed machinery in the vessel is 8700 kW. This power is distributed on three main generators of 2600 kW, one auxiliary generator of 700 kW, and one emergency generator of 200 kW. The main propulsion system consists of two azipull thrusters. In addition, there are two tunnel thrusters and one retractable azimuth thruster in the bow. Accommodation capacity for the vessel is 25 persons distributed on 19 cabins, where 13 of them are single cabins intended for the crew and 12 double cabins intended for clients. The vessel length over all is 91, 5 meters and the breadth is 20, 5 meters. Total displacement for the vessel is 9670 tonnes and the deadweight tonnage is 6295 tonnes. Total <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> tank capacity is 1612 m 3 and a total of 1690 m 3 water ballast tanks are placed in the hull to adjust vessel trim and heeling when loaded. The vessel design complies with the International Maritime Organization requirements for intact stability for the loading conditions presented. However, more loading conditions should be tested to ensure that the vessel is sufficiently safe. Large uncertainties regarding the quality of the contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> makes it difficult to determine the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance system and is therefore not identified in this thesis. Methods based on simulation could be utilized to address these issues in further development of the concept. However, experience from a similar concept, Safe Scandinavia, shows that <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance performed offshore, significantly reduce transport of contaminated <b>drilling</b> <b>fluids</b> to shore for maintenance. Similar results may therefore apply for this vessel design, but should be further analyzed. The vessel design presented is similar to a large platform supply vessel and designed to operate on a fourteen-days long roundtrip. This is due to directions given by Statoil Marine early in the design process. This reduce the overall design space early in the design process. Exploration of the entire design space could drastically change the design and ought to be done to not exclude better designs. To verify the financial feasibility of the vessel concept, an assessment of building cost, operating cost, required freight rate, and profitability should be done. This could be used to guide the design towards better solutions. The vessel design presented can however be used as a template or reference vessel for further development of the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> maintenance vessel concept...|$|R

30|$|In oil-drilling operations, a {{filtrate}} reducer is {{the most}} commonly used <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> additive. Its main functions are reducing <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> filtration by forming thin and dense filter cakes on the wellbore, thus reducing the mutual permeability between the mud filtrate and wellbore, minimizing wellbore instability, and ensuring the stability of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> performance (Zhang and Deng 1998). Partially hydrolyzed sodium polyacrylonitrile with an anionic hydration group, polyacrylonitrile calcium salts, and polyacrylonitrile ammonium salts are widely used as filtrate reducers, which meet the requirements of well drilling operations below 120  °C (Cui and Zhu 1999; Ahmed et al. 2013). The application of an allyl copolymer with cationic groups in the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> has been reported. This mainly revolves around its application to cationic and zwitterionic <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems (Zhang and Deng 1998; Warren et al. 2000). Hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide as a sealing agent has been used in water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> This can effectively improve the temperature and salt resistance of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> system (Xie et al. 2013). Lubricants based on water-soluble polyacrylamide have also been used in drilling, particularly in low-density <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems (Wang 2013). In recent years, standards of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems have become higher with the increase in deep and complex wells. Therefore, a filtrate reducer containing cationic groups is believed to have a promising application (Zlotnikov et al. 2006). There have been reports about acrylic waste fiber that can enable the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> loss agent to be cationically grafted under alkaline conditions (Yu et al. 2004; Celik et al. 2012). Still missing are the molecular structure of the cationic agent and the cationic degree of the final products. The characterization of the structure of such reaction products is yet to be reported. The application of the products and their mechanisms of activity in the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> should be further investigated.|$|R
