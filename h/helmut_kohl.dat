5|$|Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan {{were taken}} to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony. Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00pm, in front of two panes of {{bulletproof}} glass. Among the spectators were West German president Richard von Weizsäcker, Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl,</b> and West Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen.|$|E
5|$|From 1981 to 1983, Weizsäcker {{headed a}} {{minority}} government in West Berlin, after the CDU had only won 48 per cent {{of seats in}} the state assembly. His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party, who were in a coalition with the Social Democrats {{at the federal level}} at the time. After <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> had won the federal election in 1983 and had formed a government with the Free Democrats, Weizsäcker did the same in West Berlin.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} {{of his party}} for the first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of Kohl-Richter's behaviour, the entire Kohl family—his {{children}} and grandchildren—boycotted <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> funeral and all the related ceremonies.|$|R
5|$|Weizsäcker {{joined the}} CDU in 1954. Some years later, <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> {{offered him a}} safe seat for the 1965 elections, even {{going so far as}} to have Chancellor Konrad Adenauer write two letters urging him to run, but Weizsäcker declined, due to his work in the German Evangelical Church Assembly, wanting to avoid a {{conflict}} of interest. However, he became a member of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) in the 1969 federal elections, serving until 1981.|$|E
5|$|In December 1989, the Palais Rohan {{hosted the}} dinner {{parties of the}} heads of state of the European Council, {{including}} François Mitterrand, <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl,</b> Margaret Thatcher, Giulio Andreotti and Felipe González. Twenty years later, before the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit, it {{was the site of}} a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and American President Barack Obama as well as their wives Carla Bruni and Michelle Obama. In the 21st century, the palace was the setting for the official dinner for the 2016 Fed Cup finalists, the gala dinners for the 20th and the 25th anniversary of Eurimages, as well as other festive receptions, since it can be booked for such occasions from the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{stretched}} the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany’s president to reach across political, national, and age boundaries {{to address a}} wide range of controversial issues. He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo-Nazis in Mölln, in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993. He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo-Nazi attacks in Mölln and Solingen. The services were snubbed by Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl,</b> who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative.|$|E
50|$|Barzel {{served as}} Minister of All-German Affairs (1962-63) under Konrad Adenauer, as Parliamentary group {{leader of the}} CDU/CSU (1964-1973), as Minister of Intra-German Relations (1982-1983) in <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> cabinet, and as President of the Bundestag (1983-1984).|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Heribert Schwan <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> biographer {{described}} Richter as [...] "more than conservative, rather German National", {{and said}} she insists {{on the right to}} [...] "interpretational sovereignty" [...] in relation to Kohl's life and that she has insisted on many proven falsehoods.|$|R
50|$|Jochen Borchert (born 25 April 1940 in Nahrstedt, Stendal) is a German {{politician}} {{and member of}} the CDU. He was minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> cabinet from 1993 to 1998. Since 1980 he {{has been a member of}} the Bundestag.|$|R
5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the public}} {{prosecution}} {{department of the}} city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} public figures {{received}} honorary doctorates of the University of Greifswald, including Jacques Delors (former President of the European Commission) and Hannelore Kohl (wife of former German chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl).</b>|$|E
50|$|On 4 October 1982 he was {{appointed}} Federal Minister of Defence in <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> government. Wörner {{played an important role}} in defending NATO's decision to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles IRBM after arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union to reverse Soviet deployment of its SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles IRBM from the years before.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, Rau {{tried to}} become {{chancellor}} of Germany for the SPD, but {{his refusal to}} contemplate forming a coalition with the Green Party meant he could not win the elections against <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl’s</b> Christian Democrats (CDU). In 1994, Rau tried {{for the first time}} to become Federal President but lost to Roman Herzog.|$|R
5000|$|Schreiber {{became a}} {{lobbyist}} and deal maker. He was a fund raiser for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) in West Germany {{before and during}} <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> chancellorship. Schreiber stated in his Canadian House of Commons testimony on November 29, 2007 {{that he had been}} a lay judge, for nine years in Germany.|$|R
25|$|After leaving public office, Schröder {{represented}} Germany at {{the funeral}} services for Boris Yeltsin in Moscow (jointly with Horst Köhler and <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl,</b> 2007) and Fidel Castro in Santiago de Cuba (2016).|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{there was}} some {{relaxation}} of the restrictions applying to him. Chia has stated his belief that representations by Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> of West Germany in the mid-1980s played some part in the Singaporean government's decision to soften its stance in regard to him.|$|E
25|$|Buchanan {{supported}} President Reagan's plan {{to visit}} a German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, where among buried Wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 Waffen SS members. At the insistence of German Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> and over the vocal objections of Jewish groups, the trip went through.|$|E
50|$|On May 2, 2001 {{embassies}} worldwide {{were advised}} {{to accept the}} Carnet de Touriste travel insurance introduced by <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> CDU in 1995. These insurance documents covered medical costs incurred abroad {{as well as any}} costs resulting from deportation. They were accepted in place of a written guarantee by a German citizen to prove that the visa applicant could finance his stay and his return home.|$|R
50|$|From 1984 to 1991 he was {{a member}} of <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> cabinet, first as Federal Minister for Special Affairs and Chief of the Chancellery and then as Federal Minister of the Interior. Between 1991 and 2000, he was {{chairman}} of the CDU/CSU group in the parliament, and from 1998 to 2000 also CDU party chairman. He served again as Federal Minister of the Interior in the First Merkel cabinet from 2005 to 2009.|$|R
50|$|The hotel Deidesheimer Hof {{with its}} “Nobelrestaurant Schwarzer Hahn”, once run by leading-edge cook Manfred Schwarz, is known above all for former Federal Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl’s</b> visits, {{on which he}} often brought along state guests to entertain. Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, among others, thus all {{got to know the}} {{traditional}} Palatine dish Saumagen (“sow’s stomach”). The Deidesheimer Hof became the second five-star hotel in Rhineland-Palatinate in 2001 since the classification was introduced in 1996.|$|R
25|$|In 1982 the SPD {{lost power}} to the new CDU/CSU-FDP {{coalition}} under CDU Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> who subsequently won four terms as chancellor. The Social Democrats were unanimous about the armament and environmental questions of that time, and the new party The Greens was not ready for a coalition government then.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> {{was born}} on 3 April 1930 in Ludwigshafen am Rhein (then in Bavaria, now in Rhineland-Palatinate). He was the third child of Hans Kohl (6 January 1887 – 20 October 1975), an {{imperial}} army veteran and civil servant, and his wife, Cäcilie (née Schnur; 17 November 1891 – 2 August 1979).|$|E
25|$|The European Union was {{formally}} established when the Maastricht Treaty—whose main architects were <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> and François Mitterrand—came into force on 1 November 1993. The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, {{even if it}} was referred as such before the treaty. In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU.|$|E
50|$|After German reunification on 3 October 1990, {{she became}} a member of the Bundestag and, along with other leading members of the last GDR government, was also {{appointed}} Federal Minister for Special Affairs in Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> cabinet. After the 1990 all-German election, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Health on 18 January 1991. Following her party's defeat in the 1998 election, she departed from the government on 26 October 1998 but remained in the Bundestag until 2002.|$|R
50|$|The SPD was reelected with an {{increased}} share of the vote. Prime Minister Gerhard Schröder (SPD) was able to form an SPD government again. A {{few days after the}} election, Schröder was nominated as candidate for chancellorship for the federal elections in the same year by the SPD. The Social Democrats subsequently won the September 1998 federal elections in coalition with the Greens, ending 16 years of <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> leadership of Germany and resulting in Schröder becoming Chancellor of Germany, until 2005.|$|R
5000|$|The CDU {{applying}} {{the principles of}} Christian democracy and emphasising the [...] "Christian understanding of humans and their responsibility toward God." [...] CDU membership consists however of people adhering {{to a variety of}} religions as well as non-religious individuals. The CDU's policies derive from political Catholicism, Catholic social teaching and political Protestantism, as well as fiscal conservatism and national conservatism. The party has adopted more liberal economic policies since <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> term in office as the Chancellor of Germany (1982-1998).|$|R
25|$|Von Moltke {{met with}} three German Chancellors in {{connection}} with her life's work, <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> in 1998 to introduce him to the Kreisau International Youth Center built in Krzyżowa, Gerhard Schroeder in 2004 at a wreath-laying ceremony to honor Nazi resisters, and Angela Merkel in 2007 at a commemoration of the birth centenary of her husband, Helmuth von Moltke.|$|E
25|$|Jürgen Wilhelm Möllemann (15 July 1945– 5 June 2003) was a German {{politician}} of the Free Democratic Party. He {{served as}} Minister of State at the Foreign Office (1982–1987), as Federal Minister of Education and Research (1987–1991), as Federal Minister of Economics (1991–1993) and as Vice Chancellor of Germany (1992–1993) {{in the government}} of Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl.</b>|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Schäuble {{returned}} to work within three months, even {{while he was still}} living in a rehabilitation unit, learning to manoeuvre while paralysed below the waist. For his last rally in the 1990 elections, Chancellor <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl</b> traveled to Offenburg, where Schäuble made his first public appearance after the assassination attempt to a crowd of about 9,000.|$|E
5000|$|After Kohl's death, Richter denied Kohl's son Walter Kohl {{and grandchildren}} Johannes (son of Walter), aged 20, and Leyla Kohl (daughter of Peter Kohl and his Turkish wife Elif Sözen-Kohl), aged 15, entry to <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> house, the son's {{childhood}} home. Richter asked {{the police to}} tell Kohl's son and grandchildren to leave the Kohl family home when they waited outside {{to pay their respects}} to their father and grandfather. In a statement to the media, Walter Kohl accused her of [...] "tasteless behaviour." ...|$|R
50|$|In Germany, for instance, {{coalition}} {{government is the}} norm, as it is rare for either the Christian Democratic Union of Germany together with their partners the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CDU/CSU), or the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed {{with at least two}} parties. For example, <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl's</b> CDU governed for years in coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 Gerhard Schröder's SPD was in power with the Greens; and from 2009 Angela Merkel, CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.|$|R
50|$|After {{the reunification}} of Germany on 3 October 1990, Lusatians made efforts to create an {{autonomous}} administrative unit; however, <b>Helmut</b> <b>Kohl’s</b> government did not agree to it. After 1989 the Sorbian movement revived; however, it still encounters many obstacles. Although Germany supports national minorities, Sorbs claim that their aspirations are not sufficiently fulfilled. The desire to unite Lusatia {{in one of the}} federal states has not been taken into consideration. Upper Lusatia still belongs to Saxony and Lower Lusatia to Brandenburg. Liquidations of Sorbian schools, even in areas mostly populated by Sorbs, still happen, under the pretext of financial difficulties or demolition of whole villages to create lignite quarries.|$|R
