40|$|The {{life spans}} of <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> of fishes {{occurring}} in deep waters are much longer {{and their potential}} growth rates much {{lower than those of}} related shallow water species. As a result, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> are more vulnerable to exploitation. This is because low growth rates relative to the available market discount rate for capital makes it desirable for fishing firms to mine, rather than sustainably exploit, these resources {{even in the absence of}} fisheries subsidies. However, it is common knowledge that governments around the world do provide subsidies to their fishing industries. The objective of this contribution is to estimate the global amount of subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets operating in the high seas, i. e., outside of the Exclusive Economic Zones of maritime countries. Our study suggests that fisheries subsidies to these fleets stand at about US$ 152 million per year, which constitutes 15 % of the total landed value of the fleet. Economic data for bottom trawlers suggest that the profit achieved by this vessel group is normally not more than 10 % of landed value. The implication of this finding is that without subsidies, the bulk of the world’s bottom trawl fleet operating in the high seas will be operating at a loss, and unable to fish, thereby reducing the current threat to deep-sea and high seas fish stocks...|$|R
40|$|MtDNA {{sequences}} and microsatellite loci {{were used}} as independent molecular markers to reveal the genetic population structure in three <b>deep-sea</b> <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> from the North Atlantic. In the Azores archipelago, the demersal fishery {{is the second most}} important after tuna and Helicolenus dactylopterus, Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus are among the most captured species. Partial sequences for the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b gene were obtained for the three species using universal primers. The diversity encountered for these markers is consistent with diversity found on other marine fishes, except for B. decadactylus in which the d-loop and cyt b diversity was lower than expected. Haplotype data indicated a strong genetic differentiation between Helicolenus dactylopterus NW, Cape Verde and NE Atlantic populations suggesting long distance colonisation processes by jump dispersal events along major oceanic currents. Eight microsatellite loci were developed for H. dactylopterus in order to resolve population structure at a finer intraregional scale (within Portuguese waters). Significant deviations from allelic frequencies expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were detected at several loci. Analysis of FIS revealed significant differences from zero as a result of heterozygote deficiency. Estimates of FST, RST and AMOVA were also significant, suggesting that the population structure of this species within Portuguese waters was not homogeneous. Pairwise comparisons of FST, RST and genetic distances (DSW and (s) 2) between populations revealed a significant separation of the Azores and Peniche (continental Portugal) populations as well as a moderate differentiation among subpopulations of the Azores archipelago. Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus are two congeneric species with many similarities in known biology. Analysis of haplotype data revealed striking differences in structure and history of the populations of these two species. MtDNA sequences confirmed that Beryx splendens is constituted by one panmitic population within the Northeast Atlantic as has been previously hypothesised by other authors. Surprisingly, indices of genetic diversity were lower in the closely-related B. decadactylus and there was a strong genetic differentiation between Cape Verde {{and the rest of the}} NE Atlantic populations when analysed for the same molecular markers. Differences found are discussed based on the limited knowledge of these species especially with respect to lifehistory. Population structure results are discussed in relation to historical and on-going hydrogeographic events. Evidence for the strong influence of several events previous to the last glacial maximum (LGM) on the population demographic history and evolution of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>demersal</b> fish <b>species</b> in the North Atlantic was found.

40|$|Short-term {{temporal}} {{variability in}} <b>deep-sea</b> <b>demersal</b> fish assemblages is described for two slope areas characterised by different oceanographic conditions, which are situated north (Balearic sub-basin, BsB) and south (Algerian sub-basin, AsB) of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). A total of 75 hauls were analysed from six bottom trawl surveys {{carried out in}} the two sub-basins. At BsB, surveys were designed for sampling different slope habitats during April 1991, December 1991, March 1992 and July 1992 : (i) a submarine canyon at a depth of around 450 m, (ii) the upper slope at a depth of 600 - 650 m, and (iii) the middle slope at a depth of around 1200 m. At AsB, surveys were carried out during October 1996 and May 1998, along a continuous transect on the upper, middle and lower slope. The taxonomic composition, ecological parameters (number of species, abundance and biomass) and biomass spectra of the assemblages, as well as the length frequency distribution of the main species, were compared for different seasons and bathymetric ranges. Forty-four <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> were captured in BsB and 38 in AsB. Helicolenus dactylopterus and Trachyrinchus scabrus were more abundant in BsB, and Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Galeus melastomus and Centroscymnus coelolepis in AsB. Depth was the determinant factor in all the analyses. Species-specific densities (abundance and biomass) showed significant differences between surveys, depth strata and their interaction in BsB. However, survey and its interaction with depth, were not significant in AsB. We also found significant differences in relation to depth and season for the three ecological parameters tested in BsB, but only significant differences in relation to depth in AsB. Biomass spectra showed large differences in relation to depth but only slight between-survey differences, which mainly occurred in the upper slope. The length frequency distributions of single species presented short-term temporal variations, mainly due to the varying presence of a larger proportion of small or large individuals. Depth, geographic area and sampling time were the main factors determining the species composition and structure of <b>deep-sea</b> slope <b>demersal</b> fish assemblages. The effects of short-term temporal variations were observed in both the replacement and the size structure of some dominant and subdominant species throughout the year. The different temporal variation effects observed between the two sub-basins might be related to differences in productivity and its transport to the benthos. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The present work {{identifies}} {{trends in}} the abundance of the main <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> of the South Aegean Sea utilising catch and effort data derived from an international Mediterranean bottom trawl survey (MEDITS). The experimental surveys were accomplished annually from 1994 to 2000 on 61 pre-defined sampling stations. Selection of stations {{was based on a}} depth-stratified random sampling scheme that included five depth strata: 10 - 50, 50 - 100, 100 - 200, 200 - 500 and 500 - 800 m. The results suggest the existence of a general increasing trend in the biomass of the <b>demersal</b> <b>species,</b> particularly at the 10 - 50 m and 500 - 800 m depth strata. Findings are discussed in relation to the fisheries exploitation pattern and productivity of the area...|$|R
40|$|For a fish {{community}} to persist over time, all species {{must be able}} on average to replace themselves on a one-for-one basis over their lifetime. We use this principle and a size-based equilibrium model where asymptotic length {{is used as a}} functional trait to investigate how natural mortality should scale with size within and across pelagic and <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> of North Sea teleosts. The model predicts natural mortality to scale with body length raised to a power of ¿ 1. 66 at current levels of exploitation. Additionally, natural mortality of <b>demersal</b> <b>species</b> should be proportional to asymptotic length raised to a power of 0. 80, so generating a higher natural mortality at a given length for large species than for small ones. The model also suggests that the exponent in the scaling of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter K with asymptotic length should be more negative for pelagic than for <b>demersal</b> <b>species.</b> We test our results by analysing independent estimates of predation mortality, the scaling of maximum recruitment per unit of spawning-stock biomass with asymptotic length, and the general relationship between K and asymptotic length for demersal and pelagic families of fish. All tests are consistent with our modelling results...|$|R
40|$|A {{checklist}} of marine Mollusca recorded in Spanish jurisdictional waters is presented, {{based on a}} thorough literature search and a limited input of recent field work. The list is detailed according to the five demarcations of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (NOR, Spanish north coast; SUR, Spanish coast of the Gulf of Cádiz; ESAL, Strait of Gibraltar and Alboran Sea; LEBA, East coast of Spain and Balearic Islands; CAN, the Canary Islands). The list differentiates coastal species living from the supralittoral zone to the shelf break, <b>deep-sea</b> benthic or <b>demersal</b> <b>species,</b> and holoplanktonic species, and also distinguishes between non-indigenous species and species endemic to a particular demarcation. A total of 2466 marine Mollusca species have been reported from Spanish waters, of which 1126 are recorded only from waters surrounding the Iberian Peninsula, 498 are recorded from the Canaries only, and 842 are shared. That total number represents around 5. 5 % of the global marine molluscan richness. Shore and shelf species are the most numerous (1837), followed by deep-sea benthic species (490) and pelagic species (139), but {{the contribution of the}} deep-sea species is most noteworthy in NOR. All eight molluscan classes were represented, but solenogastres and scaphopods were notably more represented than usual in NOR. Species richness in SUR and ESAL was higher than would be expected from their areas, supporting the claim that Andalusian waters have an exceptionally diverse molluscan fauna. Thirteen species collected from INDEMARES cruises are here reported {{for the first time in}} Spanish waters. The species recorded in Spanish seas represent more than half of the 4340 species of Mollusca recorded within the scope of the European Register of Marine Species, making this the highest species count in European seas. The Canary Islands demarcation holds by far the largest number of endemic species (127), but special mention is needed regarding the ca. 20 species endemic to the Strait of Gibraltar, a highly anomalous chorotype in the marine realm. The number of non-indigenous species (38) is surprisingly low compared with that of species known in the Mediterranean Sea, amounting to hardly 1. 5 % of the total and supporting the view that a high number of native species tends to reduce invasion success. The list is seen as a much needed tool for the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, but requires permanent attention and curating in order to remain up-to-date...|$|R
