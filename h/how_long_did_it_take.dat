This includes two moderate sized shallow strike-slip earthquakes with high peak ground acceleration in the epicentral area. After the earthquakes a survey on earthquake intensities was carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Research Centre of the University of Iceland. The survey also included questions addressing safety issues, as well as demographic information. The data dealt with herein cover a total of 249 respondents in the epicentral area. In the analysis presented the main emphasis is on the following three questions. Did you manage to seek shelter inside a house during the earthquake? Did you manage to keep your balance? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> for you to recover?

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. The task of archaeologists is {{to infer}} the {{cultural}} processes {{at work in}} the (often distant) past, based on an examination of the artifactual, biological, and environmental evidence of human civilizations that remains today. Ancient monuments, like other cultural constructions, can reveal clues about the societies that created them, provided researchers ask suitable questions and devise appropriate strategies for discovering the answers. Initial archaeological surveys of monumental buildings are typically designed to answer "what" types of questions: investigators describe, measure, and map the structures they uncover. The next generation of research generally deals with "how" questions, for example, how were monuments built? <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to construct them? How much labor was required? How did the buildings function? Eventually, archaeologists begin to explore the more difficult "why" questions. Why did ancient societies begin to construct monuments? Why did monumental construction persist, in some cases for hundreds of years? Finally, why did monument building decline and disappear...|$|E
40|$|Bose-Einstein condensation, or BEC, has a {{long and}} rich history dating from the early 1920 s. In this article we will trace briefly over this history {{and some of the}} {{developments}} in physics that made possible our successful pursuit of BEC in a gas. We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this dis-cussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of “How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it?

There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what makes BEC in a dilute gas so interesting, unique, and experimentally challenging. 1 The notion of Bose statistics dates back to a 1924 paper in which Satyen...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of time and}} temporal concepts is critical for interacting with the world and with other agents in the world. What does a robot {{need to know to}} refer to the temporal aspects of events-could a robot gain a grounded {{understanding of}} a long journey, or soon? Cognitive maps constructed by individual agents from their own journey experiences have been used for grounding spatial concepts in robot languages. In this paper, we test whether a similar methodology can be applied to learning temporal concepts and an associated lexicon to answer the question <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to complete a journey. Using evolutionary language games for specific and generic journeys, successful communication was established for concepts based on representations of time, distance, and amount of change. The studies demonstrate that a lexicon for journey duration can be grounded using a variety of concepts. Spatial and temporal terms are not identical, but the studies show that both can be learned using similar language evolution methods, and that time, distance, and change can serve as proxies for each other under noisy conditions. Effective concepts and names for duration provide a first step towards a grounded lexicon for temporal interval logic...|$|E

In {{addition to its}} original goal of ticketing, {{the large amount of}} transaction data collected by the smart card system can be utilized for many operational and management purposes. This paper investigates an important prob-lem: how to extract spatiotemporal segmentation information of trips inside a metro system. More specifically, for a given trip, we want to answer several key questions: <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take for a passenger to walk from the station gantry to the station platform?

Chances are your {{response}} is a ball park estimate and its value depends on how fast you have scanned the text, how prepared you have been for this question, perhaps your mood or how much attention you have paid to these words. Time perception is here addressed in three sections. The first section summarizes theoretical difficulties in time perception research, specifically those pertaining to the representation of time and temporal processing. The second section reviews non-exhaustively temporal effects in multisensory perception. Sensory modalities interact in temporal judgement tasks, suggesting that (i) at some level of sensory analysis, the temporal properties across senses can be integrated in building a time percept and (ii) the representational format across senses is compatible for establishing such a percept. In the last section, a two-step analysis of temporal properties is sketched out. In the first step, it is proposed that temporal properties are automatically encoded at early stages of sensory analysis, thus providing the raw material for {{the building of a}} time percept; in the second step, time representations become available to perception through attentional gating of the raw temporal representations and via re-encoding into abstract representations...|$|E

40|$|Introducing a {{child to}} {{kindergarten}} is an activity that awakes mixed feelings in child and parents. Parents receive key information in kindergarten from the preschool teacher and preschool teacher assistant who {{will take care of}} the child. Parents have to take time for introduction, the amount of time depending on the child itself. It is highly important that parents trust the institution, people in it, and that they transmit this trust to the child. These facts are supported by professionals and parents who are directly confronted with the situation. In the theoretical part of the final thesis, I touched upon a subject of family as a value which has its unique importance and represents the world to the child. I focused on chapters which deal with attachment, communication and relationships between teachers and parents as they are essential in introducing {{a child to}} kindergarten. I also presented the family and kindergarten in the context of cooperation, organization of work, and programs in kindergarten. The last subject I wrote about is the gradual introduction of a child to kindergarten, which is the main thread of my final thesis. In empirical part, I researched and determined what parents think about introducing, how important they consider the introduction of a child to kindergarten, what are their experiences, how did the introduction of a child to kindergarten proceed, what problems they were facing with and how they were dealing with them, what was their communication with preschool teacher like, what was their role in the introduction process, where did they get information about introduction and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to introduce a child to kindergarten...|$|E
