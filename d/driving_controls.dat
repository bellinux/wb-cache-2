Access {{to the car}} was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand operated sliding doors on the car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row 2 is {{a mobile}} tie-in action game {{developed}} by G5 Entertainment {{and published by}} THQ Wireless to accompany the Saints Row 2 console game. It was released in October 2008. The game follows {{the story of the}} series where the player returns from jail and fights to protect and expand his gang's territory. The player can steal, carjack, mug, shoot, stab, and kill computer players. There are special minigames for robbing, stealing, and carjacking. Completing missions earns money to be spent towards replenished supplies and player upgrades. Reviewers contended that the game was too large for the small screen, which exacerbated difficult <b>driving</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to calculate the}} minimum-fuel <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> for a point-mass vehicle on a road with constant slope. The main control is the engine torque. Gear shifting, clutch disengagement, and braking {{are taken into account}} with a switching condition. The methodology can take into account distance and time constraints. Only longitudinal vehicle dynamics are used in combination with a quasistatic polynomial fuel consumption model. Simulations are given to analyze the optimal <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> and assess the fuel savings for acceleration and deceleration. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|However, {{one of the}} {{sticking}} points was {{the lack}} of reliability from the railmotor fleet; by mid 1982 none of the DRC railcars were in good condition, and the DERM fleet was only achieving 38% availability; this required 'scratch' sets of between 2 and 4 older wooden carriages hauled by locomotives as replacements. VicRail looked into the costs of buying a new fleet of railmotors and found the cost for a 2-carriage airconditioned railmotor to be in the range of $1.6-2.5million each. An alternative, cheaper proposal was to rebuild the DRC's electrical systems, and to replace other railmotor rosters with T class locomotives and refurbished Harris carriages. The proposed consist at the time was H-H-T-H-H, with the outer H carriages fitted with <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> and all cars fitted with multiple-unit cabling.|$|E
500|$|The {{walking and}} <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt [...] "like they've been {{attached}} {{with an old}} stick of glue that's about as adhesive as baby oil". Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that [...] "the Tony Hawk series has always had exceptional controls" [...] and that Underground, overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels' replay value. Similarly, Famitsu reviewers noted that, although the game's fast pace makes it extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides {{a sense of accomplishment}} when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version's controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot stated that the mobile version's restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version's only caveat.|$|E
500|$|Self-propelled [...] "steam railmotors" [...] {{were first}} used on 12 October 1903 between [...] and {{within five years}} 100 had been constructed. These trains had special {{retractable}} steps {{that could be used}} at stations with lower platforms than was usual in England. The railmotors proved so successful on many routes that they had to be supplemented by trailer cars with <b>driving</b> <b>controls,</b> the first of which entered service at the end of 1904. From the following year a number of small locomotives were fitted so that they could work with these trailers, the combined sets becoming known as [...] "autotrains" [...] and eventually replacing the steam rail motors. Diesel railcars were introduced in 1934. Some railcars were fully streamlined, some had buffet counters for long-distance services, and others were purely for parcels services.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Levi Buchanan {{described}} {{the game as}} somewhere between a traditional tie-in game and a cash grab, and [...] "ambitious" [...] but limited by {{the confines of the}} mobile platform. He added the game appeared forced onto the platform despite its inability to support open world gameplay. Keith Andrew of Pocket Gamer felt similarly, and Rob Hearn of the same outlet also complained of how the large sprites restricted screen space and made driving slower. IGN's Buchanan felt that the screen was too small to fit so much action, especially due {{to the size of the}} minimap, and though the city [...] "looks alive", it became [...] "a painful obstacle course". He found driving difficult between its controls and his inability to plan for the offscreen unknown. Pocket Gamer Andrew also found both <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> complicated and found himself accidentally killing pedestrians and thus getting into police chases. On the other hand, Andrew Podolsky of 1UP.com enjoyed driving through the destructible environments.|$|E
500|$|The team {{overhauled}} the game's {{shooting and}} driving mechanics {{to match the}} standards of its contemporaries. Public reception to the team's previous games (such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3) was considered during the process. To increase the pace of shootouts, the team removed hard lockinga central mechanic in Grand Theft Auto IV that instantly locks onto the enemy nearest to the crosshair. Associate technical director Phil Hooker found hard locking [...] "too disorientating" [...] and immersion-breaking, [...] "as you didn't {{have to think about}} enemy locations". He said that Grand Theft Auto IV players [...] "just rely on holding and shooting until a target is dead", so Grand Theft Auto V introduces a timer that breaks the lock on a target after a few seconds. The team refined Red Dead Redemptions cover system for the game, with increased fluidity moving into and out of cover. Regarding the reworked vehicle mechanics, Houser felt the game took influence from racing games and corrected Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "boat-like” <b>driving</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
500|$|Sleeper berth time is {{any amount}} of time spent inside the sleeper berth (e.g., resting or sleeping). FMCSA {{regulation}} §393.76 gives the minimum requirements for a space to be defined as a sleeper berth. The simple definition is an area separate from (usually immediately behind) the <b>driving</b> <b>controls</b> that includes a bed. The rules do not explicitly require that a driver must sleep, only that a driver must take a period of [...] "rest" [...] within the sleeper berth or off-duty (i.e., home). A statement made by the ICC in 1937 gives the reason: [...] "We have no control over the manner in which a driver may spend his time off-duty, although some of his spare time activities may tire him as much as any work would do. We can only emphasize, by this comment, the responsibility which is the driver's own to assure himself of adequate rest and sleep, in the time available for this purpose, to ensure safety of his driving, and likewise the employer's responsibility to see that his drivers report for work in fit condition." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{electric}} off-road vehicle with separated driven axles as the research object. To solve the longitudinal dynamics <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> problems, vehicle dynamics model, and control strategies were studied {{and the corresponding}} simulation was carried out. An 8 -DOF vehicle dynamics model with separated driven axles was built. The <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> strategies on the typical roads were put forward. The recognition algorithm of the typical road surfaces based on the wheels’ slip rates was proposed. And the two control systems were designed including the pedal opening degree adjustment control system based on PI algorithm and the interaxle torque distribution control system based on sliding mode <b>control</b> algorithm. The <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> flow of the proposed vehicle combining the pedal adjustment control system with the interaxle torque distribution control system was developed.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} different <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> {{methods of}} electric vehicle (EV), and presents a new H ∞ robust <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> strategy for an EV. Our research {{work is done}} under different conditions, namely, variable battery voltage and variable load rotational inertia separately. A comparison between conventional PID control method and H ∞ robust control method is made when they are applied to the above mentioned conditions. Under the driving conditions, simulations and experimental results both indicate that PID controller and H ∞ robust controller give good results. However, the H∞ robust controller gives a faster response and a better stability. Furthermore, H ∞ robust control follows the given current faster and more smoothly than by PID control and improve the drive range of EVs, especially for the vehicle in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel test point insertion method for pseudorandom built-in self-test (BIST) {{to reduce the}} area overhead. The proposed method replaces dedicated flip-flops for <b>driving</b> <b>control</b> points by existing functional flip-flops. For each control point, candidate functional flip-flops are identified by using logic cone analysis that investigates the path inversion parity, logical distance, and reconvergence from each control point. Four types of new control point structures are introduced based on the logic cone analysis results to avoid degrading the testability. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed method significantly reduces test point area overhead by replacing the dedicated flip-flops and achieves essentially the same fault coverage as conventional test point implementations using dedicated flip-flops <b>driving</b> the <b>control</b> points.
