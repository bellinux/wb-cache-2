The value of money depends on the cost of production at the worst mines; (2.) The value of money varies inversely as its quantity multiplied by its rapidity of circulation; (3.) The countries whose products are most in <b>demand</b> <b>abroad</b> and contain the greatest value in the smallest bulk, which are nearest the mines and have the least demand for foreign productions, are those in which money will be of lowest value.|$|E
6000|$|To {{be quite}} accurate, therefore, we must say: The {{countries}} whose exportable productions (1) are most in <b>demand</b> <b>abroad,</b> and (2) contain greatest value in smallest bulk, (3) which are nearest to the mines, and (4) which have least demand for foreign productions, {{are those in}} which money will be of lowest value, or, in other words, in which prices will habitually range the highest. If we are speaking not {{of the value of}} money, but of its cost (that is, the quantity of the country’s labor which must be expended to obtain it), we must add (5) to these four conditions of cheapness a fifth condition, namely, “whose productive industry is the most efficient.” This last, however, does not at all affect the value of money, estimated in commodities; it affects the general abundance and facility with which all things, money and commodities together, can be obtained.(273) ...|$|E
60|$|When, therefore, {{the state}} of prices is such that the {{equation}} of international demand can not establish itself, the country requiring more imports than can {{be paid for by}} the exports, it is a sign that the country has more of the precious metals, or their substitutes, in circulation, than can permanently circulate, and must necessarily part with some of them before the balance can be restored. The currency is accordingly contracted: prices fall, and, among the rest, the prices of exportable articles; for which, accordingly, there arises, in foreign countries, a greater demand: while imported commodities have possibly risen in price, from the influx of money into foreign countries, and at all events have not participated in the general fall. But, until the increased cheapness of American goods induces foreign countries to take a greater pecuniary value, or until the increased dearness (positive or comparative) of foreign goods makes the United States take a less pecuniary value, the exports of the United States will be no nearer to paying for the imports than before, and the stream of the precious metals which had begun to flow out of the United States will still flow on. This efflux will continue until the fall of prices in the United States brings within reach of the foreign market some commodity which the United States did not previously send thither; or, until the reduced price of the things which she did send has forced a <b>demand</b> <b>abroad</b> for a sufficient quantity to pay for the imports, aided perhaps by a reduction of the American demand for foreign goods, through their enhanced price, either positive or comparative.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the role of local {{distributors}} of apples for export in Aomori, Japan. Recently, the apples for export to Taiwan are remarkably increasing. The local distribution channel is an organization made up of mainly three distributors; private companies, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperatives of joint selling. And they independently export apples to the overseas market. However, the distribution system is originally developed for domestic selling, and it is not completely adjusted to exports. Consequently, there are some functional differences between each distributor; product standard at the time of primary collection and collection/marketing abilities, which leads to obstacles to international trade. The problem is that the distributors are remaining as mere collectors of the products, just passively reacting to market <b>demands</b> <b>abroad...</b>|$|R

60|$|The causes which bring {{money into}} or {{carry it out}} of a country (1) through the exchanges, to restore the {{equilibrium}} of trade, and which thereby raise its value in some countries and lower it in others, are the very same causes on which the local value of money would depend, if it were never imported except (2) as a merchandise, and never except directly from the mines. When the value of money in a country is permanently lowered (1) [as a medium of exchange] by an influx of it through the balance of trade, the cause, if it is not diminished cost of production, must be one of those causes which compel a new adjustment, more favorable to the country, of the equation of international demand—namely, either an increased <b>demand</b> <b>abroad</b> for her commodities, or a diminished demand on her part for those of foreign countries. Now, an increased foreign demand for the commodities of a country, or a diminished demand in the country for imported commodities, are the very causes which, on the general principles of trade, enable a country to purchase all imports, and consequently (2) the precious metals, at a lower value. There is, therefore, no contradiction, but the most perfect accordance, in the results of the two different modes [(1) as a medium of exchange; and (2) as merchandise] in which the precious metals may be obtained. When money [as a medium of exchange] flows from country to country in consequence of changes in the international demand for commodities, and by so doing alters its own local value, it merely realizes, by a more rapid process, the effect which would otherwise take place more slowly by an alteration in the relative breadth of the streams by which the precious metals [as merchandise] flow into different regions of the earth from the mining countries. As, therefore, we before saw that the use of money as a medium of exchange does not in the least alter the law on which the values of other things, either in the same country or internationally, depend, so neither does it alter the law {{of the value of the}} precious metals itself; and there is in the whole doctrine of international values, as now laid down, a unity and harmony which are a strong collateral presumption of truth.|$|E

In order to quantify the direct effects of sanctions on the trade flows between countries I make use of a gravity equation controlling for country pair, importer-year, and exporteryear fixed effects. The estimates reveal {{that there is a}} significant decrease in the value of trade after the introduction of sanctions. In a second step, trade diversion is introduced as a potential instrument for countries to soften the negative impact of sanctions.

40|$|This book {{presents}} new original {{research on}} the main impediments to exports facing transition economies. It specifically addresses questions such as: Are the impediments to exports mainly internal and demand related, or are they associated more with the conditions of supply? How are governments promoting exports now that their influence over enterprise activity has been reduced? What strategies have enterprises developed to overcome existing barriers to exports? And what role does investment play {{in the development of}} competitive export potential? The authors focus on the export performance of eight small transition economies with special emphasis on the behavior of exporting enterprises. Results of the analysis reveal that in the mid- 1990 s the companies' inherited conditions and their strategies, as well as the domestic economic situation, are more important in determining export performance than characteristics of <b>demands</b> <b>abroad.</b> The authors conclude that exports have {{played a key role in}} the transition economies' recent recovery from recession and that further dismantling of remaining impediments will be critical as these economies become more integrated with the Western World. The book will be essential for policy makers, governments and private sector business as well as for academics who analyze trade developments in Central and Eastern Europe and propose relevant policies to tackle impediments to exports...|$|R

50|$|Denmark often {{produces}} more electricity from windpower {{than the entire}} country requires and will export it for sale or for storage in hydroelectric dams in Norway and Sweden. Occasionally electricity prices turn negative for producers {{when there is a}} glut of electricity production and lack of <b>demand</b> <b>abroad</b> as well. One result of this has been the growth of electric boilers being installed in district heating plants. When there is an excess of electricity the plants can use cheap electricity to heat the hot water instead of finite bio or fossil fuels. As wind production rises the problem of too much electricity being generated will also give rise to new challenges and solutions. Electric heating and cooling can also be used in the form of more efficient heat pumps to mop up excess electricity supply. The electricity sector will in effect expand into the heating and cooling sector to displace current energy sources.|$|E

40|$|How does an {{unexpected}} domestic monetary expansion affect the foreign economy? Does it induce an increase or {{a decline in}} foreign production? In the traditional two-country Mundell-Fleming model, monetary policy has beggar-thy-neighbor effects. Yet, empirical evidence from VARs indicates that U.

In this paper, I will show that a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with sticky prices can account for these stylized facts if we allow for international asymmetries in the price-setting behavior of firms.

40|$|Renewable energy {{targets in}} the European Union (EU) have raised the demand for timber and are {{expected}} to increase dependence on imports. However, EU timber consumption levels are already disproportionally high compared {{to the rest of the}} world. The question is, how much timber is available for the EU to sustainably harvest and import, in particular considering sustainable forest management practices, a safe operating space for land-system change, and the global distribution of "common good" resources. This article approaches this question from a supply angle to develop a reference value range for the current as well as future sustainable supply of timber at the EU- 27 and global levels. For current supply estimates, national-level data on forest area available for wood supply, productivity in that area, as well as the rate available for harvest were collected and aggregated into three potential supply scenarios. For future supply estimates, a safe operating space scenario halting land use change, a sensitivity analysis, and a literature review were performed. To provide both a comparison of global versus EU sustainable supply capacities and to develop a benchmark toward evaluating and comparing levels of consumption to sustainable supply capacities, per capita calculations were made. Results revealed that the per capita sustainable supply potential of EU forests is estimated to be around three times higher than the global average in 2050. Whether a global or EU reference value is more appropriate for EU policy orientation, considering both strengthened economic and cultural ties to the forest in forest-rich countries as well as the need to prevent problem shifting associated with exporting land <b>demands</b> <b>abroad,</b> is discussed.
