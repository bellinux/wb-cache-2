40|$|The Food Safety Authority of Ireland in {{collaboration}} with the Marine Institute and An Board Iascaigh Mhara (Sea Fisheries Board) has carried out a surveillance study of levels of dioxins (PCDDs), furans (PCDFs) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), specifically polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), in a variety of fish species and fishery products, including fresh and processed products available on the Irish market. The study was undertaken because of concern about the possible effects on human health of these bio-persistent environmental contaminants, known to be present in a number of foodstuffs, notably meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. The study showed that levels of PCDDs and PCDFs in Irish fish and fishery products available on the Irish market were well below existing EC legal limits for these contaminants as laid down in Regulation 466 / 2001. The lowest level was found in a sample of canned tuna (0. 012 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight) with the highest level found in a farmed salmon sample (0. 82 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight), compared with the maximum level under the legislation of 4 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight. The levels found were also below the new limits for dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) and for the sum of WHO-TEQs for PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs, which were introduced in November, 2006 via Regulation 199 / 2006. The upper-bound mean levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs expressed as total WHOTEQs ranged from 0. 05 – 2. 15 ng/kg WHO TEQ whole weight, which can be compared with the new maximum level of 8 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight for the sum of PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs. Results of this study are in line with those from previous FSAI studies on PCDD and PCDF levels in fish and also in meat, milk and eggs, and indicate relatively low levels of these contaminants in fishery produce available in the Irish marketplace. Reductions of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in Irish farmed salmon were observed in comparison to levels measured in a previous FSAI/MI survey in 2001, in which a mean level of 4. 02 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight was detected compared with 2. 15 ng/kg WHO TEQ whole weight in the present study. Similar observations can be made for levels reported in a study carried out by An Board Iascaigh Mhara in 2004, in which a mean level of 1. 75 ng WHO TEQ/kg whole weight was reported. Concentrations of brominated flame retardants were also low. The mean PBDE concentrations ranged from < 0. 31 to 3. 71 µg/kg whole weight in canned tuna to farmed salmon respectively. Although there are no acceptable daily intake (ADI) or maximum limits set for PBDEs or HBCD, the levels of these contaminants found in the study were low, and are very unlikely to present a health risk to Irish consumers. Although fish is a recognised dietary source of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs, the health benefits of eating fish are well established, and {{on the basis of these}} results the FSAI considers that there is no need to alter current advice on fish consumption. Current advice is that consumers should eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily.

40|$|Survival of {{extremely}} preterm infants has increased over recent years, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains {{a major cause}} of morbidity. In the USA, BPD is the most common chronic respiratory disorder of infancy and affects the pulmonary and overall health of 10, 000 preterm infants annually. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest a crucial role for lung inflammation and host immune response in the pathogenesis of BPD. Inflammation may result from, amongst others, chorioamnionitis, postnatal infection, ventilation, and the administration of oxygen. Infants with BPD have worse long-term outcomes than those without chronic lung disease. They are {{more than twice as likely}} to be readmitted to hospital in their first year of life and, having survived their primary hospitalizations, they are more likely to die than very preterm infants without chronic lung disease. Survivors with BPD have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment and their respiratory function remains compromised well into adolescence. As the first generations {{of extremely}} low birth weight (ELBW) survivors have not yet reached retirement age, there are currently no reliable data addressing the association between BPD and pulmonary diseases of the elderly such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although BPD is quite common in ELBW infants, there are infants who do not develop BPD, which supports the argument that BPD is a preventable disease, emphasizing the need for high-quality safety and efficacy prevention studies. However, according to an Institute of Medicine statement regarding pediatric drug studies, the therapeutic area that has the fewest drugs indicated for neonates is BPD. As inflammation seems to be a primary mediator of injury in the pathogenesis of BPD, anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids have long been the focus of preventive research activities. However, systemic steroids, although reducing BPD, have frequently been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and these considerations may have contributed to the recently reported widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids in neonatal units in North America and Europe. Inhaled corticosteroids were prescribed to 25 % of infants born at < 29 weeks of gestation with birth weights < 1, 500 g in neonatal units of 35 children's hospitals in the USA. According to a survey across all neonatal units in Germany, 46 % administered inhaled corticosteroids to preterm infants either as prophylaxis or treatment for BPD [10]. Pediatricians and neonatologists should ask themselves whether the off-label use of inhaled corticosteroids in preterm infants is justifiable in view of the available evidence. The authors of the pertinent review from the Cochrane Collaboration, including 7 studies and 492 infants, conclude that there is currently no evidence to support the routine use of inhaled steroids for the prevention of BPD. Recently, the primary outcome results of the Neonatal European Study of Inhaled Steroids (NEUROSIS), including 863 very preterm infants (gestational age 23 - 27 weeks), have been presented at scientific conferences, but the <b>full</b> <b>study</b> <b>report</b> is not yet published. By contrast, intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle has not yet become part of clinical practice. There are fewer studies addressing the risks and benefits of this mode of administration. In a randomized blinded pilot study in 116 very low birth weight infants who had severe radiographic respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation shortly after birth, early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle resulted in significantly lower mean airway pressure on day 1 and day 3 and a significantly lower oxygen index and PCO 2 during the first 3 days compared with infants in the control group who had received surfactant without corticosteroids. More infants were extubated in the treatment group than in the controls at 1 and 2 weeks and the combined outcome of death or chronic lung disease was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (19 of 60 vs. 34 of 56). No clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the study and at the time of the follow-up assessment at 2 - 3 years of age. In the future, intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle may play a role in the prevention of BPD in ELBW infants. However, before this therapy can be introduced into routine clinical care, remaining open questions need to be answered and appropriately powered studies need to be performed...|$|E

40|$|Loop quantum {{gravity is}} one of the leading {{candidate}} theory to non-perturbatively quantize gravity. In this framework, holonomy corrections to the equation of propagation of gravitons in a FLRW background have been derived. We investigate the consequences of those corrections on the tensor power spectrum in de-Sitter and slow-roll inflations, for n=- 1 / 2. Depending on the value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, several observational features could be expected. This brief note aims at providing a first estimate of possible Loop Quantum Gravity footprints on the tensor power spectrum. It focuses on the specific n=- 1 / 2 case and the <b>full</b> <b>study</b> will be <b>reported</b> in a dedicated article 1. In canonical quantum gravity, dynamics is determined by a Hamiltonian (constraint) operator rather than a path integral. Relevant quantum corrections can therefore be obtained at the level of an effective Hamiltonian (as opposed to an effective action in a covariant quantization). To study the quantum effects expected from Loop Quantum Gravity (LGQ) corrections, an effective tensor mode Hamiltonian has been derived by Bojowald & Hossain 2 (for a general introduction to LQG and Ashtekar variables, one can refer to the book ”Quantum Gravity” by Rovelli 3).

Nevertheless, even following the development of modern toxicology this story repeats itself 45 years later with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) another compound of concern for public health.

This case study compares {{the quality and quantity}} of harms data reported in journal publications and clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> of orlistat trials. Methods Publications related to clinical trials of orlistat were identified through comprehensive literature searches. A request was made to Roche (Genentech; South San Francisco, CA, USA) for clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> related to the orlistat trials identified in our search. We compared adverse events, serious adverse events, and the reporting of 15 harms criteria in both document types and compared meta-analytic results using data from the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> against the journal publications. Results Five journal publications with matching clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> were available for five independent clinical trials. Journal publications did not always report the complete list of identified adverse events and serious adverse events. We found some differences in the magnitude of the pooled risk difference between both document types with a statistically significant risk difference for three adverse events and two serious adverse events using data reported in the clinical study reports; these events were of mild intensity and unrelated to the orlistat. The CONSORT harms reporting criteria were often satisfied in the methods section of the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> (70 – 90 % of the methods section criteria satisfied in the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports</b> compared to 10 – 50 % in the journal publications), but both document types satisfied 80 – 100 % of the results section criteria, albeit with greater detail being provided in the clinical <b>study</b> <b>reports.</b> Conclusions In this case study, journal publications provided insufficient information on harms outcomes of clinical trials and did not specify that a subset of harms data were being presented.
