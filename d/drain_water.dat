5|$|Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937 {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} sent workers {{to assess the}} former railroad tunnels. In September of that year, a contract was awarded to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from the tunnels. After this, workers cleared rock slides and vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels' condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels would be bypassed with rock cuts through the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to <b>drain</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other heat {{sources for}} heat pumps include water; nearby streams {{and other natural}} water bodies have been used, and {{sometimes}} domestic waste water (via <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> heat recovery) which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures (though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated).|$|E

25|$|The reserve also {{receives}} {{an average of}} four severe tropical storms every ten years. The tropical storms echo {{through the rest of}} the reserve through the numerous waterways. Development plans and agriculture depend upon the river’s natural levees to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from low-lying areas. The after-effects of the Hurricane Mitch in 1998 disrupted the development of the Patuca II hydroelectric facility.|$|E
25|$|Filter strips {{are areas}} of grass or other {{permanent}} vegetation that protect riparian areas from sediment runoff, pesticides, pathogens, organics and nutrients. These strips {{are very important}} in protecting stream banks and water quality. Filter strips work best when other conservation practices are used in order to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> in their direction. Filter strips were originally used mostly in agriculture, but now are a common practice in urban areas where water quality has become an increasingly important issue.|$|E
25|$|Denton Colliery was {{the largest}} of these mines and {{eventually}} absorbed the other local pits, often using their shafts for ventilation or, {{in the case of}} Hulmes Pit, as a pumping station to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from the main workings. Denton Colliery was connected to the London & North Western Railway's line from Guide Bridge to Stockport by a standard gauge tramway. The tramway was worked by steam power, rather than horses, as evidenced by a photograph held in the Tameside Local History Library archives.|$|E

25|$|Land {{reclamation}} works {{involving the}} use of over 52,000,000cubicmeters (68,000,000yd3) of landfill and seafill began in Changi in June 1975, even as the airport at Paya Lebar {{was still in the}} midst of expansion works. About 2squarekilometers (494acres) of swamp land was cleared and filled with 12,000,000cubicmeters (15,700,000yd3) of earth from the nearby hills, while another 40,000,000cubicmeters (52,300,000yd3) of sand were used to fill up the seabed. Canals were built to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from three existing rivers, namely Sungei Tanah Merah Besar, Sungei Ayer Gemuroh and Sungei Mata Ikan. In total, 870hectares (2,150acres) were reclaimed, raising the total site area to 1,300 hectares. Of this, landfill accounted for 200hectares (494acres) while seafill represented 670hectares (1,655acres).|$|E
25|$|Inundation and {{sediment}} deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks {{which are a}} common feature of salt marshes. Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, {{as well as to}} <b>drain</b> <b>water,</b> and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and can thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota. Salt marshes do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface although salt marshes with this morphology seem to be rarely studied.|$|E
500|$|As {{the area}} was still an undeveloped jungle, Temenggong {{encouraged}} the migration of Chinese and Javanese to clear the land and to develop an agricultural economy in Johor. The Chinese planted the area with black pepper and gambier, while the Javanese dug parit (canals) to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from the land, build roads and plant coconuts. During this time, a Chinese businessman, pepper and gambier cultivator, Wong Ah Fook arrived; at the same time, Kangchu and Javanese labour contract systems were introduced by the Chinese and Javanese communities. After Temenggong's death on 31 January 1862, the town was renamed [...] "Johor Bahru" [...] and his position was succeeded by his son, Abu Bakar, with the administration centre in Telok Blangah being moved to the area in 1889.|$|E

500|$|On the River Witham, the Grand Sluice was {{constructed}} and opened on 15 October 1766, and this prevented tidal water {{from entering the}} river, and hence flooding the Holland Fen. The Boston Harbour Commissioners were created by the Boston Port Act 1766, and they carried out improvement works to The Haven, which resulted in lower water levels at the Black Sluice, and hence more efficient draining from the South Forty-Foot <b>Drain.</b> <b>Water</b> was pumped into the drain {{by a series of}} windmills driving scoop wheels. Maps of the area produced in 1783 by Edward Hare show 46 such mills, which provided drainage for [...] of agricultural land. Extreme high tides in 1810 and again in 1820 resulted in widespread flooding, and further thought was given to improving the flood defences.|$|E
500|$|In pots, {{the species}} {{requires}} well-drained, sandy potting soil and bright, sunny conditions. Aloe plants can burn under too much sun or shrivel when the pot does not <b>drain</b> <b>water.</b> The {{use of a}} good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged [...] "cacti and succulent mix" [...] is recommended, as they allow good drainage. Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous. Potted plants {{should be allowed to}} completely dry before rewatering. When potted, aloes can become crowded with [...] "pups" [...] growing from the sides of the [...] "mother plant". Plants that have become crowded should be divided and repotted to allow room for further growth and help prevent pest infestations. During winter, Aloe vera may become dormant, during which little moisture is required. In areas that receive frost or snow, the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.|$|E

500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because she worried about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{water from}} Lake Mead reaches the turbines, {{it enters the}} intake towers and then four {{gradually}} narrowing penstocks which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of [...] as the water reaches a speed of about [...] The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works (jet-flow gates) are rarely used. The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures [...] above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, {{may be used to}} divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from the penstocks for maintenance. Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.|$|E
500|$|The next {{significant}} advance was in 1630, {{when the}} Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was {{employed by the}} Earl of Bedford and others to drain the Fens. [...] The Old Bedford River was cut from Earith to Salters Lode, a distance of , and provided sufficient drainage that the land {{could be used for}} summer grazing. Vermuyden published a document in 1642, entitled Discourse touching the draining of the Great Fennes, in which he proposed the division of the fens into three zones, the North Level, the South Level, and between them, the Middle Level, stretching from Morton's Leam to the Bedford River. An Act of Parliament, the Pretended Act, was obtained in 1649, and work began under his supervision. The New Bedford River was constructed, running parallel to the Old, and the Middle Levels area was protected. [...] The Forty Foot, Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot Rivers were cut soon afterwards, to <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> from the area to Salters Lode and Welches Dam. In addition to these new channels, the Middle Level also contained [...] of the old course of the Nene, and the ancient artificial waterways of King's Dyke and Whittlesey Dyke, which connect Stanground to Floods Ferry. To the north is Well Creek, most of which was a natural waterway, although the final section to Salters Lode Lock follows the course of the New Podyke, a drainage channel constructed in the early sixteenth century. The primary function of the waterways was drainage, but water levels were managed to enable them to be navigated. The volumes of traffic carried are not well documented, especially in the early period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Film {{radiography}} may {{be perceived}} as technology with environmental concerns, involving the application of chemicals and the discharge of <b>drained</b> <b>waters</b> with high silver levels. Ecological legislation concerning silver content of the wash water differs from country to country. GE Inspection Technologies now offers industrial radiographers several ways to address regulatory limits silver in <b>drained</b> <b>waters.</b> First, two brand new film processors, the Agfa NDT Si and M eco, are introduced to the NDT market. Both machines are equipped with Cascade Fixing Technology, which reduces silver content in the wash water and increases the ability to comply with stricter discharge standards. Next the new eco Film System is presented. This system is based on the new machines, specially adapted films and carefully developed new chemicals. Eco stands for ecological and economic performance. The customer can now process films in a very short cycle, saving money while increasing its ability to comply with environmental limits on discharges of silver into <b>drained</b> <b>waters.</b> This paper will also address other means to reduce the silver freight in the wash water...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{there are}} no {{perennial}} rivers and rainfall is unreliable, water is a highly precious commodity in Somaliland. Water supply systems throughout the country are, therefore, dependent on underground sources. Cognizant of the recurring droughts and inadequate water supply systems of cities and towns, the Silanyo Administration introduced a water development policy. The central policy of the Administration’s water development program is, inter alia, drilling bore holes and damming dry - river beds that <b>drain</b> <b>water</b> into the sea during the two rainy seasons.|$|E
