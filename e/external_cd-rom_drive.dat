50|$|<b>External</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> connect via SCSI {{connector}} at {{the rear}} side of the box. The typical drive supports boot, OS install, audio. A special ROM is required to boot from for certain device types.A small number of <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> have the firmware needed to do audio over SCSI.|$|R
50|$|The Amiga A570 is a single-speed <b>external</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> for the Amiga 500 {{computer}} {{launched by}} Commodore in 1992. It {{was designed to}} be compatible with Commodore CDTV software as well as being able to read ordinary ISO 9660 CD-ROM discs.|$|E
50|$|Not {{wishing to}} repeat its earlier mistake of {{offering}} {{a way to}} turn a CD32 into an enhanced A1200 as it did with the A500-based CDTV, Commodore itself made no hardware available for that purpose. One of its last hardware designs, however, was an <b>external</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> for the A1200 that featured the CD32's Akiko chip, thus turning any A1200 into a CD32-compatible system.|$|E
50|$|The early models did {{not come}} with an {{internal}} CD-ROM drive, but these soon appeared as mobile technology progressed. Such models can link up with an <b>external</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> through the parallel port on the rear (since USB ports came later as well). Some Satellites also lacked an internal floppy disk drive, but a port on the side allowed {{the use of a}} proprietary external module for such. These machines tended to be smaller in physical size than their contemporaries.|$|E
5000|$|The Octane {{cases are}} large (WxHxD: 30x40x35 cm) and heavy (25 kg), {{yet there are}} no {{internal}} 5.25" [...] <b>drive</b> bays, so <b>external</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> must be connected if desired. Extensions include video I/O, audio I/O, networking, realtime video compression boards, and external storage options (through SCSI, Fibre-Channel or Firewire). Octanes can use standard PCI cards with optional PCI cardcage (which provides 2-full length and 1 half-length 5V PCI-64 slots), or a PCI to XIO adapter (known as a 'shoehorn' which provides a single 3.3/5V 64-bit PCI slot). Older Octanes can be upgraded with VPro graphics however V10 and V12 graphics board require xbow revision 1.4 and Cherokee power supply. VPro V6 and V8 require xbow revision 1.3 and Cherokee power supply. There's distinct difference between Cherokee (747 watt) and older Lucent (623 watt) power supplies. Mounting handle is silver in the Cherokee International manufactured power supplies while the original Lucent manufactured ones have black handles.|$|R

5000|$|... onEscapee was {{developed}} by Invictus Games, Ltd. and published by the UK-Based (and now defunct) Sadeness Software. It was distributed in a CD format, which was unusual for the period since the Amiga 1200 was not fitted with a CD drive. Therefore, the users were required to purchase an additional <b>external</b> <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> (or re-house the computer to fit an internal drive) in order to run software from discs. Since Invictus is a Hungarian team, to make the game as international as possible, text and speech was kept to a minimum. As a result, the game has support for over 17 languages. The only language featured in the game is in the music used in the titles and in one scene of the game, the menus, help text and the opening FMV sequence.|$|E
5000|$|CD-ROM discs {{are read}} using <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b> A <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> may be {{connected}} to the computer via an IDE (ATA), SCSI, SATA, FireWire, or USB interface or a proprietary interface, such as the Panasonic CD interface, LMSI/Philips, Sony and Mitsumi standards, [...] Virtually all modern <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> can also play audio CDs (as well as Video CDs and other data standards) when used with the right software.|$|R
50|$|Other PAS cards {{included}} proprietary interfaces to <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> {{they were}} packaged with. These included drives made by Sony and Matsushita (Panasonic). There was also variant with LMSI controller for LMSI Philips CM205, CM206 <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
