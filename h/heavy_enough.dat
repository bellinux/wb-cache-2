5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{liquid water}} {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to fall under gravity. Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation.|$|E

5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed <b>heavy</b> cruisers, <b>enough</b> armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed {{so that they could}} get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|R
5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> {{to make the}} cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery and spare parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also {{make it possible to}} send less-than-container shipments.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
500|$|Given its shallow depth, Bowie Bank is a {{potential}} marine hazard. Waves up to [...] high have been recorded along the British Columbia Coast during <b>heavy</b> weather, <b>enough</b> to expose the bank by wave troughs and cause devastation to any vessel transiting the seamount. For this reason, Environment Canada has recognized Bowie Seamount as a hazard to navigation and is avoided by shipping vessels.|$|R

50|$|The 3rd, 5th, and 6th Ranger Groups, all {{operational}} in the III Corps area, {{were grouped}} together into the Third Ranger Command {{through which the}} ARVN attempted to form another division, {{but the lack of}} <b>enough</b> <b>heavy</b> weapons prevented this from happening.|$|R
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> {{to cover her}} withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

50|$|In December 1970, {{electrification}} of {{the line}} from Hamm via Warburg to Kassel was completed and travel time of luxury express trains (D-Züge) was shortened from 156 to 140 minutes. Since not <b>enough</b> <b>heavy</b> electric locomotives were available, goods trains were hauled until 1973 by class 44 steam locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes twin-engined {{aircraft}} {{were used}} in planned kamikaze attacks. For example, Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryū ("Peggy") medium bombers, based on Formosa, undertook kamikaze attacks on Allied forces off Okinawa {{and a pair of}} Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu ("Nick") <b>heavy</b> fighters caused <b>enough</b> damage for the USS Dickerson (DD-157) to be scuttled.|$|R
5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Task Force Smith, Dean ordered the US 34th Infantry Regiment and other {{elements}} of the division to conduct delaying actions south of Osan, but he was disappointed and frustrated by the result. The 34th Infantry was badly defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek where it only briefly resisted the North Koreans before retreating in disarray. Dean was angered by the poor performance of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but did not do so fearing the unit would be ambushed. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Jay B. Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The North Koreans outnumbered Dean's troops, and the US forces had no weapons <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to destroy the North Korean T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly after Miss Ladd {{had taken}} her departure, a parcel arrived for Emily, bearing {{the name of a}} {{bookseller}} printed on the label. It was large, and it was <b>heavy.</b> [...] "Reading <b>enough,</b> I should think, to last for a lifetime," [...] Mrs. Ellmother remarked, after carrying the parcel upstairs.|$|R
50|$|The facades {{are made}} of bamboo {{interwoven}} with plant fibres with some featuring geometric patterns. The doors are framed with carved panels are elevated 50 cm above the ground so that runoff and animals can not enter. The whole is surmounted by a conical roof which is <b>heavy</b> and thick <b>enough</b> to not let raindrops filter through.|$|R
50|$|While a vest {{can prevent}} bullet penetration, the vest and wearer still absorb the bullet's impulse. Even without penetration, <b>heavy</b> bullets deal <b>enough</b> force to cause blunt force trauma under the impact point. Vest {{specifications}} will typically include both penetration resistance requirements and {{limits on the}} amount of impact force that is delivered to the body.|$|R
25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam locomotive}} was Matthew Murray's rack locomotive Salamanca {{built for the}} Middleton Railway in Leeds in 1812. This twin-cylinder locomotive was not <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to break the edge-rails track and solved the problem of adhesion by a cog-wheel using teeth cast {{on the side of}} one of the rails. Thus it was also the first rack railway.|$|E
25|$|The Bell 209 {{design was}} {{modified}} for production. The retractable skids {{were replaced by}} simpler fixed skids. A new wide-blade rotor was featured. For production, a plexiglass canopy replaced the 209's armored glass canopy which was <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to harm performance. Other changes were incorporated after entering service. The main one of these was moving the tail rotor from the helicopter's left side to the right for improved effectiveness of the rotor.|$|E
25|$|This example {{does show}} how crucial (and difficult) the {{decisions}} of the umpires can be, in assessing when rain is <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to justify ceasing play. If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a dot ball – indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.|$|E

50|$|The {{district}} has very <b>heavy</b> snowfall (sometimes <b>enough</b> to block major roads) and strong winds in winter, and its turbulent rivers {{are the source}} of abundant hydroelectric power. Niigata Prefecture is the site of domestic gas and oil production as well. Industrial development is extensive, especially in the cities in Niigata and Toyama; Fukui and Ishikawa prefectures also have large manufacturing industries.|$|R
25|$|The armor {{was very}} thick {{compared}} to other tanks of the time, up to 12inches (305mm) thick on the front. This was considered <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to provide protection from the German 88mm gun used as tank gun and anti-tank guns. The lower hull front had 5.25 in (130mm) of armor, and the sides 2.5 in (64mm). The suspension system and lower hull were covered with 4-in (100mm) thick steel skirts. The engine was a gasoline-powered Ford GAF V-8, delivering 500hp, at 2600 rpm though the Torqmatic transmission, which left the vehicle underpowered, geared down to {{a top speed of}} about 8mph (13km/h) and greatly limited its obstacle-climbing capability.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.|$|E
25|$|Though this broadside-attack tactic was effective, it {{came too}} late {{to have a real}} effect on the war, and only small numbers of Me 262s were {{equipped}} with the rocket packs. Most of those so equipped were Me 262A-1as, members of Jagdgeschwader 7. This method of attacking bombers became the standard, and mass deployment of Ruhrstahl X-4 guided missiles was cancelled. Some nicknamed this tactic the Luftwaffe's Wolf Pack, as the fighters often made runs in groups of two or three, fired their rockets, then returned to base. On 1 September 1944, USAAF General Carl Spaatz expressed the fear that if greater numbers of German jets appeared, they could inflict losses <b>heavy</b> <b>enough</b> to force cancellation of the Allied bombing offensive by daylight.|$|E
60|$|Azim {{had already}} sent two disciples {{to summon the}} Turk to the {{presence}} of the Grand Marabout, and in due time he appeared--a rough, <b>heavy,</b> truculent fellow <b>enough,</b> but making awkward salaams as one in great awe of the presence in which he stood--unwilling awe perhaps--full of superstitious fear tempered by pride--for the haughty Turks revolted against homage to one of the subject race of Moors.|$|R
50|$|It took a quarter-hour for 16 men {{pulling on}} the bell rope to swing the <b>heavy</b> bell back-and-forth <b>enough</b> before the clapper would strike. But the forces from {{swinging}} the 22,500 kg (49,600 lb) bell endangered {{the structure of the}} beloved tower, so in 1878 Friedrich von Schmidt, the cathedral's architect, ordered that it be rung only by pulling its clapper, instead of being swung.|$|R
50|$|Stair descent {{involves}} perceptual, {{cognitive and}} motor abilities. It {{relies heavily on}} visual information to enable balance and accuracy. Seeing obstacles ahead helps stair descent, but for infants the action of keeping their <b>heavy</b> head balanced <b>enough</b> {{to look down at}} their feet and the objective together, make the process very difficult. (Hurlke, 1998). Not seeing the task ahead causes confusion and disrupts concentration.|$|R
