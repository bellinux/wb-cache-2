2500|$|I {{received}} a letter from the ITF that I failed a drugs test at the Australian Open. I take full responsibility for it. For the past ten years I have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor and a few days ago after I received the ITF letter I found out that it also has another name of meldonium which I did not know. It is very <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to understand that for ten years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had legally been taking the medicine for the past ten years. But on January 1st [...] the rules had changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance which I had not known. I was given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues that I was having in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the scandal, Haggard went on {{administrative}} leave from New Life saying [...] "I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership {{so that the}} overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity. I {{hope to be able}} to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date. In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance." [...] On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station KKTV that Haggard had admitted to some of the claims made by Jones. In an e-mail to New Life Church parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote, [...] "It is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to know that he [...] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true." [...] Haggard admitted that he had purchased methamphetamine and received a massage from Jones, but he denied using the drugs or having sex with Jones.|$|E

5000|$|Johnson raised {{questions}} about McKinney's controversial confrontation with a U.S. Capitol police officer. During the second debate on August 5, 2006, Johnson pointed to the Capitol Hill incident {{as an example of}} what he has called McKinney's embarrassing leadership in office. Johnson also {{raised questions}} about McKinney missing votes in Congress. He specifically asked about her missing a vote to extend the National Voting Rights Act of 1965: [...] "If the Voting Rights Act is not <b>important</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to show up, then what is <b>important</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to show up?" ...|$|R

"Very <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> I have no doubt," [...] {{answered}} the Rocket, [...] "but I shall weep if I choose"; {{and he actually}} burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and {{were looking for a}} nice dry spot to live in.|$|E

"In that case," [...] {{the doctor}} replied earnestly, [...] "the {{position}} would be exactly reversed, {{and it would}} be just as <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not to check the affection which she might offer to you as {{it would be in the}} other case for you not to accept it. The moment she realises, with her present predispositions, that you really are her lawful husband, that moment will be the beginning of a new life for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, {{you must}} all promise me that, {{if you come}} to this place again, you will come {{straight}} up here, and look upon it as your home. If you get ill or wounded--which I hope will not happen--you will, of course, go home; but something may occur not sufficiently <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to leave the corps, but which could be set straight by a few days' nursing, and rest. In that case, you will come to us, will you not?" ...|$|E

"I hope you're well, sir," [...] he resumed: [...] "most <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to {{have your}} health now you're going-to"--and, feeling for the {{delicate}} way to put it, he involuntarily winked--"to become a family man. We {{saw it in the}} paper. My wife said to me the other morning at breakfast: 'Bob, here's a Mr. Richard Paramor Shelton goin' to be married. Is that any relative of your Mr. Shelton?'

5000|$|In 1989, Perez {{became a}} member of Dizzy Gillespie's United Nations Orchestra. The album Live at the Royal Festival Hall won a Grammy Award. He {{remained}} with the band until Gillespie died in 1992. He stated in a press report for the Independent that [...] "one of the things Dizzy taught me was to learn about my own heritage even more than I knew already. He said it was more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> jazz <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to get to what your roots are, than to learn about other things".|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will begin}} with the event," [...] he resumed. [...] "Your arrival at this place is no secret at Windygates. You were seen on the foot-road to Craig Fernie {{by one of the}} female servants. And the {{inference}} naturally drawn is, that you were on your way to the inn. It may be <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to know this; and I have taken the liberty of mentioning it accordingly." [...] He consulted his watch. [...] "Event related. Time, one minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is assuredly no dream, Father," [...] he said gently. [...] "I {{am really}} your son, Dick. I am {{here with a}} trusty friend, {{and now we have}} found you, you may be sure that we will, in some way, manage your escape. There is no time, now, to tell you all that has happened. That I can do, afterwards. All that is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to know, is, that Mother is quite well. She has never given up hope, and has always insisted that you were alive, for she said that she should surely have known, if you had died. So she taught me her language, until I could speak like a native; and two years and a half ago, she came out here with me.|$|E
60|$|I {{dare say}} I {{may have to}} return to this point by-and-by; but having dealt thus far with our logical methods, I must now turn to {{something}} which, perhaps, you may consider more interesting, or, at any rate, more tangible. But in reality there are but few things that can be more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to understand than the mental processes and the means by which we obtain scientific conclusions and theories.

It is a {{tremendous}} victory, and you see it is as <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{as it is for}} us, for the French army is now cut off. It will be a long time indeed before the French can fit out another fleet strong enough to have even a chance of fighting ours, and, as far as I can see, the only possible escape for their army is to march all the way round by Syria to Constantinople, and I should think that after this the Sultan will at once declare war with them, for by conquering Egypt they have taken one of his provinces." ...|$|E

60|$|I daresay {{you will}} find, {{in the modern}} books, that Simon's real name was Peter, and Philip's real name was Bartholomew; and Angelo's real name was Taddeo, and Taddeo's real name was Angelo; and Memmi's real name was Gaddi, and Gaddi's real name was Memmi. You may find out all that at your leisure, afterwards, if you like. What it is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to know here, in the Spanish Chapel, is only this much that follows:--There were {{certainly}} two persons once called Gaddi, both rather stupid in religious matters and high art; but one of them, I don't know or care which, a true decorative painter of the most exquisite skill, a perfect architect, an amiable person, and a great lover of pretty domestic life. Vasari says this was the father, Taddeo. He built the Ponte Vecchio; and the old stones of it--which if you ever look at anything on the Ponte Vecchio but the shops, you may still see (above those wooden pent-houses) with the Florentine shield--were so laid by him that they are unshaken to this day.|$|E

6000|$|... 26. It is so <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to be {{grounded}} securely in these first elements of pictorial treatment, that I will be so far tedious as to show you one more instance of the relative intellectual value of the pure color and pure chiaroscuro school, not in Dutch and Florentine, but in English art. Here is a copy {{of one of the}} lost frescoes of our Painted Chamber of Westminster;--fourteenth-century work, entirely conceived in color, and calculated for decorative effect. There is no more light and shade in it than in a Queen of Hearts in a pack of cards;--all that the painter at first wants you to see is that the young lady has a white forehead, and a golden crown, and a fair neck, and a violet robe, and a crimson shield with golden leopards on it; and that behind her is clear blue sky. Then, farther, he wants you to read her name, [...] "Debonnairete," [...] which, when you have read, he farther expects you to consider {{what it is to be}} debonnaire, and to remember your Chaucer's description of the virtue:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a {{way your}} {{drawings}} are very good; tone and colour, {{in some of}} them certainly quite a feeling for Nature. But, you see, they're so scattered; you'll never get the public to look at them. Now, if you'd taken a definite subject, such as 'London by Night,' or 'The Crystal Palace in the Spring,' and made a regular series, the public would have known at once {{what they were looking}} at. I can't lay too much stress upon that. All the men who are making great names in Art, like Crum Stone or Bleeder, are making them by avoiding the unexpected; by specializing and putting their works all in the same pigeon-hole, so that the public know at once where to go. And this stands to reason, for if a man's a collector he doesn't want people to smell at the canvas to find out whom his pictures are by; he wants {{them to be able to}} say at once, 'A capital Forsyte!' It is all the more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to be careful to choose a subject that they can lay hold of on the spot, since there's no very marked originality in your style." ...|$|E
60|$|You say {{you shall}} {{instruct}} your delegates for me, unless I object. I certainly shall not object. That {{would be too}} pleasant a compliment for me to tread in the dust. And besides, if anything should happen (which, however, is not probable) by which Baker should be {{thrown out of the}} fight, I would be at liberty to accept the nomination if I could get it. I do, however, feel myself bound not to hinder him in any way from getting the nomination. I should despise myself were I to attempt it. I think, then, it would be proper for your meeting to appoint three delegates and to instruct them to go for some one as the first choice, some one else as a second, and perhaps some one as a third; and if in those instructions I were named as the first choice, it would gratify me very much. If you wish to hold the balance of power, it is <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to attend to and secure the vote of Mason also: You should be sure to have men appointed delegates that you know you can safely confide in. If yourself and James Short were appointed from your county, all would be safe; but whether Jim's woman affair a year ago might not be {{in the way of his}} appointment is a question. I don't know whether you know it, but I know him to be as honorable a man as there is in the world. You have my permission, and even request, to show this letter to Short; but to no one else, unless it be a very particular friend who you know will not speak of it.|$|E
