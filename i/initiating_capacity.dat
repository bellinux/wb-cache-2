40|$|SummaryK-Ras and H-Ras share {{identical}} effectors {{and have}} similar properties; however, {{the high degree}} of tumor-type specificity associated with K-Ras and H-Ras mutations suggests that they have unique roles in oncogenesis. Here, we report that oncogenic K-Ras, but not H-Ras, suppresses non-canonical Wnt/Ca 2 + signaling, an effect that contributes strongly to its tumorigenic properties. K-Ras does this by binding to calmodulin and so reducing CaMKii activity and expression of Fzd 8. Restoring Fzd 8 in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cells suppresses malignancy, whereas depletion of Fzd 8 in H-RasV 12 -transformed cells enhances their tumor <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity.</b> Interrupting K-Ras-calmodulin binding using genetic means or by treatment with an orally active protein kinase C (PKC) -activator, prostratin, represses tumorigenesis in K-Ras mutant pancreatic cancer cells.

40|$|Human {{leukocyte}} antigen class I (HLA-I) down-regulation {{has been}} reported in many human cancers to be associated with poor clinical outcome. However, its connection to tumor-initiating cells (TICs) remains unknown. In this study, we report that HLA-I is down-regulated in a subpopulation of cells that have high tumor <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> in different types of human sarcomas. Detailed characterization revealed their distinct molecular profiles regarding proliferation, apoptosis and stemness programs. Notably, these TICs can be induced to differentiate along distinct mesenchymal lineages, including the osteogenic pathway. The retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway is overexpressed in HLA- 1 negative TICs. All-trans retinoic acid treatment successfully induced osteogenic differentiation of this subpopulation, in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significantly decreased tumor formation. Thus, our findings indicate down-regulated HLA-I is a shared feature of TICs in a variety of human sarcomas, and differentiation therapy strategies may specifically target undifferentiated TICs and inhibit tumor formation...|$|E

We cultured human GSCs endowed with all features of tumor stem cells, including tumor initiation after xenograft and radio-chemoresistance. We established proteomes from four GSC cultures and their corresponding whole tumor tissues (TTs) and from human NSCs. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed a twofold increase of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) in GSCs as compared to TTs and NSCs. Western blot analysis confirmed HDGF overexpression in GSCs {{as well as its}} presence in GSC-conditioned medium, while, in contrast, no HDGF was detected in NSC secretome. At the functional level, GSC-conditioned medium induced migration of human cerebral endothelial cells that can be blocked by anti-HDGF antibodies. In vivo, GSC-conditioned medium induced neoangiogenesis, whereas HDGF-targeting siRNAs abrogated this effect. Altogether, our results identify a novel candidate, by which GSCs can support neoangiogenesis, a high-grade glioma hallmark.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{chromatin}} mechanisms that regulate tumor-initiating cells that are proposed {{to be responsible for}} tumor recurrence and relapse. We have previously shown that Pygopus 2 (Pygo 2), a chromatin effector and context-dependent Wnt signaling co-activator, regulates mammary gland development by expanding epithelial stem/progenitor cells. However, the role of Pygo 2 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo remains to be addressed. In this study, we show that epithelia-specific ablation of Pygo 2 in MMTV-Wnt 1 transgenic mice results in delayed mammary ductal elongation, but the hyperbranching phenotype, aberrant accumulation of stem/progenitor-like cells, and canonical Wnt signaling output are largely unaffected. Chronic loss of Pygo 2 significantly delays mammary tumor onset in MMTV-Wnt 1 females, whereas acute deletion of Pygo 2 in MMTV-Wnt 1 tumor cells leads to a significant decrease in their tumor initiating capability upon transplantation. Finally, we provide evidence supporting a role for Pygo 2 in modulating the lineage potential of MMTV-Wnt 1 tumor initiating cells.

Recently, the identification of a tumor cell subset defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs), which is enriched for tumor <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity,</b> has engendered new perspectives towards selective targeting of tumors. In this study, we isolated the side population (SP) cells which share characteristics of CSCs from bladder cancer cell lines, T 24 and UM-UC- 3 by fluorescence activated cell sorting. The {{cells were cultured in}} serum free medium and expression profile of stem cell like markers (SOX- 2, NANOG, KLF- 4 and OCT- 4), drug resistant genes (ABCG 2 and MDR 1) and spheroid forming capability were examined in SP, non-side population (NSP) and bulk T 24 and UM-UC- 3 cells. We observed that SP cells possessed a higher mRNA expression of SOX- 2, NANOG, KLF- 4, OCT- 4, ABCG 2, and MDR 1 as well as a higher spheroid forming ability as compared to other bulk cells or NSP cells. The SP cells had low ROS levels and high GSH/GSSG ratio which may contribute to radio-resistance. The SP cells also showed substantial resistance to gemcitabine, mitomycin and cisplatin compared with the NSP counterpart. A high autophagic flux was observed in the SP cells. Both pharmacological and siRNA mediated inhibition of autophagy potentiated the chemotherapeutic effects of gemcitabine, mitomycin and cisplatin in these cells. We concluded that the ABCG 2 expressing SP cells show autophagy associated cell survival and may be a potent target for developing more effective treatment in bladder carcinoma to enhance patient survival...|$|E

Although publication of the research in peer-reviewed journals is an important indicator for measuring {{the success of this}} endeavor, the influence of operational research on policy and practices is considered even more important.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the influence of operational research on tuberculosis control policy and practice in Indonesia between 2004 and 2014. Design: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted in-depth interviews of 50 researchers and 30 policy makers/program managers and performed document reviews. Transcripts of these interviews were evaluated while applying content analysis. Results: Operational research contributed to tuberculosis control policy and practice improvements, including development of new policies, introduction of new practices, and reinforcement of current program policies and practices. However, most of these developments had limited sustainability. The path from the dissemination of research results and recommendations to policy and practice changes was long and complex. The skills, interests, and political power of researchers and policy makers, as well as health system response, could influence the process.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a finite-horizon nonstationary dynamic single-asset assembly problem, which covers both a liquid-asset assembly problem, {{based on the}} work of Rosling published in 1989, where the single asset is the single product being assembled, and a fixed-asset assembly problem, in which the single asset is production capacity. In the latter case, capacity is assembled over time from components and may be used to manufacture many products. In the spirit of Rosling, we provide conditions under which it can be solved by an equivalent analogous serial model in the form developed by Clark and Scarf in 1960, with a separate state variable for the level of assets in each stage of completion, dramatically simplifying the problem and its solution. In the liquid-asset case, we extend Rosling 2 ̆ 7 s 1989 work by including nonstationary demands, costs, and revenues in a finite-horizon setting. In the fixed-asset (capacity) expansion case, we show that capacity should be assembled in a balanced way and derive the optimal timing and extent of delays (in previously <b>initiated</b> <b>capacity</b> expansions). Our basic capacity expansion model is deterministic, so under our conditions, it is optimal never to delay a schedule and the state space reduces to a single dimension. However, in the Markov-modulated case, in which cost parameters and customer demand distributions can be influenced by a randomly and exogenously evolving state (of the economy), we illustrate that delays can be optimal.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of children with T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) fail to respond to therapy and experience early relapse. CD 99 {{has been shown to}} be overexpressed on T-ALL cells and is considered to be a reliable detector of the disease. However, the relevance of CD 99 overexpression in ALL has not been investigated in a functional context. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional capacity of CD 99 + cells in childhood ALL and determine the suitability of CD 99 as a therapeutic target. Flow cytometric analyses confirmed higher expression of CD 99 in ALL blasts (81. 5 ± 22. 7 %) compared to normal hemopoietic stem cells (27. 5 ± 21. 9 %) and T cells (3. 1 ± 5. 2 %, P≤ 0. 004). When ALL cells were sorted and assessed in functional assays, all 4 subpopulations (CD 34 +/CD 99 +, CD 34 +/CD 99 -, CD 34 -/CD 99 + and CD 34 -/CD 99 -) could proliferate in vitro and establish leukemia in NSG mice. Leukemia propagating cell frequencies ranged from 1 in 300 to 1 in 7. 4 x 104 but were highest in the CD 34 +/CD 99 - subpopulation. In addition, all four subpopulations had self-renewal ability in secondary NSG mice. Cells in each subpopulation contained patient specific TCR rearrangements and karyotypic changes that were preserved with passage through serial NSG transplants. Despite high levels of CD 99 antigen on the majority of blast cells, leukemia <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> in vivo was not restricted to cells that express this protein. Consequently, targeting CD 99 alone would not eliminate all T-ALL cells with the ability to maintain the disease.

40|$|Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is characterised by the FUS-DDIT 3, or {{the less}} common EWSR 1 -DDIT 3 fusion {{oncogene}} {{and is the}} second most common type of liposarcoma. The fusion oncogenes encode chimeric transcription factors that are causal factors in tumourigenesis however, their functions are poorly known. Notwithstanding continuous progress in treating MLS patients, existing therapies suffer from a major flaw as they do not target the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Unique features of CSCs include self-renewal, tumour <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> and increased resistance to radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced cell death. Thus, CSCs are crucial targets for successful therapy. The aims of this project were to define the role of fusion oncogenes in tumourigenesis and to define signalling pathways controlling CSC features in MLS. Here, we demonstrated that MLS has an intact TP 53 system that may explain why this tumour entity is genetically stable. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms, expression levels and effects of FUS-DDIT 3 in detail, and showed that FUS-DDIT 3 was uniquely regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational level. We also screened 70 well-characterised kinase inhibitors and determined their effects on cell proliferation and FUS-DDIT 3 expression at mRNA and protein levels. To facilitate these studies, we developed a novel direct lysis approach that enables us to quantify, cell proliferation, mRNA and protein expression in the same sample. This method allowed us to identify a number of previously unknown signalling pathways that regulated the expression of FUS-DDIT 3. To study cell division and growth in detail, we applied single-cell analysis on unsynchronized cells at different cell cycle phases and cell sizes. We found that the total transcript level per cell and the expression of most individual genes correlated with progression of the cell cycle, but not with cell size. Detailed studies of cell cycle predictive genes revealed a previously unknown G 1 subpopulation. Finally, we showed that MLS contains cells with CSC features and that JAK-STAT signalling controls their numbers. Leukaemia inhibitory factor stimuli increased the number of CSCs, while JAK inhibition depleted the CSC pool. Inhibition of JAK-STAT also showed synergistic effects when combined with chemotherapy in vitro. Our findings concerning FUS-DDIT 3 function and CSCs have increased our molecular understanding of tumour development and therapy resistance in MLS that will facilitate development of specific treatment strategies...|$|E
40|$|Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) {{has seen}} a large {{development}} since its first implementation in 1969 as a policy instrument for informed decision-making and long-term sustainable development. However, the performance of EIA in low- and middle-income countries (LMCs) is often considered to be lacking due to lacking capacities of the actors. Capacity building intends to develop the actors’ capacities, but often forgets to take the context into account. This results in EIA systems that do not fit the context and thereby {{do not meet the}} objectives of EIA. Current literature on EIA emphasises the importance of context on the performance of EIA, but does not describe how EIA systems should be adapted to the context. This research aims to develop an analysing tool for EIA practitioners in LMCs and developing organisations working in LMCs to identify context-specific EIA capacities and mechanisms to secure these. A stepwise approach has been developed from the literature that should lead to the identification of context-specific capacities and securing mechanisms. The approach consists of nine steps that include: 1. 	Identification of EIA system performance; 2. 	Identification of the main actors in the EIA system; 3. 	Identification of the level of ownership of the main actors; 4. 	Identification of the relative influence of the main actors; 5. 	Identification of the actors’ capacities that can be developed; 6. 	Identification of the actors’ capacities that should be developed or secured; 7. 	Developing a strategy for capacity building; 8. 	<b>Initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> building; and 9. 	Evaluating capacity building. These steps have been evaluated and refined using two focus discussions with representatives of EIA authorities from LMCs and experts in capacity building in LMCs from the Netherlands. The first discussion focussed on strengthening the reliability of the approach, while the second discussion provided for the practical applicability of the approach. Although the primary aim of the stepwise approach is to enhance system development in LMCs, it is thought that it can be used for all EIA systems. The context matters for the outcome of the approach, but does not influence the steps in the approach. Moreover, the stepwise approach is thought to include all aspects of system development, as identified by Kolhoff et al. (2009; 2013; 2014), Lawrence (2013), and the UNDP (2009). Furthermore, in this research {{it has been suggested that}} securing mechanisms also determine system performance, as they ensure that capacities remain even when actors drop out of the system...|$|E

40|$|Metastatic {{spread of}} cancer cells to vital organs is the {{predominant}} {{cause of death}} among women suffering from breast and ovarian cancer, and invasive cancer cells are in many cases resilient to standard drugs used in the clinic. Consequently, further understanding of the metastatic process and development of new strategies to target invasive cancer cells are needed. One process that has been closely linked to cancer cell invasion and migration is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a developmental process, which can be reactivated during cancer progression. EMT allows carcinoma cells, with an epithelial origin, to acquire mesenchymal and migratory properties that are employed to invade the surrounding tumor tissue. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate how EMT is induced in breast and ovarian cancer cells and to study the role of EMT in drug resistance. Relapse of resilient cancer cells after surgery and first line of drug treatments is {{a major cause of}} death in ovarian and breast cancer. Currently, {{little is known about the}} functional properties of cancer cells that develop resistance to existing drug treatments and how they can be targeted. The aim of study I was to characterize the phenotypic properties of ovarian cancer cells that developed resistance to cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used in the clinic. We found that human SKOV- 3 ovarian cancer cells that acquired resistance to cisplatin gained properties of EMT and cancer stem cells, suggesting that they were more invasive than drug-sensitive cells. Indeed, functional experiments showed that cisplatin-resistant SKOV- 3 cells were more migratory in invasion assays and displayed an increased tumor <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> compared to cisplatin-sensitive cells. The results from these studies link EMT to drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells, and emphasize that further understanding of EMT is needed and to be able to target EMT for therapy. In study II-IV we investigated how cellular sensitivity to EMT is regulated. In particular, we focused on identifiying epithelial differentiation factors that regulate EMT in breast cancer cells. We identified two transcription factors – C/EBPβ and Foxp 4 that were lost during breast cancer progression, which conferred cells an enhanced capacity to undergo EMT as well as to gain invasive and metastatic properties in experimental in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer. In addition, we identified the coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a tight junction-based cell adhesion molecule, as a novel regulator of Akt signaling and TGF-β-induced EMT in breast cancer cells. The mechanism was traced to a role of CAR in regulating localization, stability and function of the phosphatase Pten, a potent Akt inhibitor, at tight junctions. The results from these studies indicate that the EMT process is not solely regulated by factors that drive a mesenchymal differentiation program, but also, is under tight control by epithelial differentiation factors. Loss of C/EBPβ, Foxp 4 and CAR may lead to increased cellular sensitivity to EMT and thereby open up the possibility that cancer cells acquire invasive and migratory properties. Based on this, we propose that novel therapies aiming to strengthen, or preserve, epithelial differentiation mechanisms in breast or ovarian cancer cells, might be useful as a type of differentiation therapy to inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of cancer stem cells (CSC) postulates that tumors are organized as a cellular hierarchy and that tumor initiation, growth and cellular heterogeneity {{are driven by}} a subset of cells with stem cell like properties. The CSCs are endowed {{with the ability to}} self-renew and thereby to proliferate indefinitely. At a functional level, CSCs are characterized by their ability to regenerate in vivo from a single cell into the full spectrum of histology of the tumor of origin and to form spheroid colonies in vitro in an anchorage independent environment. The specific aims for this project include setting up assays that will enable the quantification and the characterization of CSCs and evaluating cell surface markers to enrich for CSC. Additionally, in our in vivo assays, we will compare different mice strains as hosts to our in vivo assays. In order to assess the frequency of CSCs within a solid tumor, we established an in vitro and in vivo limited dilution assay (LDA). A known number of cells were seeded in a low attachment well with stem cell growth media, and the number of spheroids that grew was counted by Optronix GelCount. In an in vivo LDA, immune deficient mice were inoculated with a specific number of cells, and the number of tumor bearing mice was counted. In order to optimize our methods, immortalized colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines COLO 205 and T 84 were used as tools to develop LDAs. We were able to determine that the sphere and tumor-forming efficiency of COLO 205 was superior to T 84, resulting in the primary use of COLO 205 cells for assay development. We also aimed to compare the tumor <b>initiating</b> <b>capacity</b> of the COLO 205 cell line in order to investigate the effect of the mouse immune system on the read-out of the in vivo tumor formation assay. The result of this experiment was inconclusive; no tumors grew, which is a defect that we could pinpoint to a loss of viability of sorted tumor cells by FACS. We worked with four colorectal cancer models derived from patient tumors and continuously passaged in immune deficient mice. Two models were established from primary tumors obtained from the Amgen Tissue Bank. These tumors were dissociated and cultured in serum-free stem cell growth media on low attachment plates. The other two models were obtained from a company that had continuously passaged the tumors in immune deficient mice. We used these two models to test mouse immune background and effects of irradiation on tumor initiation. Antibodies to extracellular proteins epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD 133 were used to enrich for a homogenous population of CSCs by sorting protocols. We could not confirm that either of these is a good marker but did find that FACS sorting may affect tumorigenicity and viability of CSCs in our CRC models. The outcome of the CSC enrichment procedure will be important to enable further characterization at the molecular and cellular level of CSC and the identification of potential therapeutic targets that could selectively eliminate CSCs. i...|$|E
40|$|The {{passage of}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006 was hailed by the {{international}} disability rights movement as "giving voice" to millions of persons with disabilities around the world. The Convention institutionalizes a role for Disabled Persons Organizations (DPOs) in monitoring their rights. As such, international disability NGOs, networks, and funders have <b>initiated</b> <b>capacity</b> building projects that organize persons with disabilities for advocacy in local communities around the world. A central tension, however, has emerged. While the international disability movement is interested in mobilizing grassroots groups, it is also interested in ensuring that those DPOs reflect global priorities. As such, the international movement is engaged in promoting a very narrow organizational model that corresponds to membership-based, human rights advocacy that conflicts directly with the self-help, social support model that {{is the basis of}} many local disabled persons organziations, especially in the developing world. Using qualitative data drawn from fieldwork with grassroots disability associations in Northern Nicaragua, this article shows that international and national organizations have utilized a number of methods, including providing advocacy training, establishing new organizations, formalizing reporting procedures, to bring DPOs together around a human rights advocacy agenda. Program implementation, however, revealed a narrow concern with political empowerment that did not resonate with a local focus on addressing material needs and the instillation of a strict hierarchy and bureaucratic procedures that did not allow local DPOs to deviate from pre-determined, top-down agendas. This case study provides insight into the way global civil society legitimates itself through outreach directed at the grassroots, yet does not allow their full participation in interpreting and implementing their human rights. When local groups resist, it is understood {{as the result of a}} lack of consciousness or clear understanding rather than the strategic response of associations embedded in cooperative relationships and focused on addressing the material needs of their member...|$|R

Here he became a leading figure in the ratlines sponsored by Juan Perón to rescue Nazis from prosecution in Europe. Given wide powers within the Immigration service in Argentina, Lagrou drew up ambitious plans to move as many as 2 million people from Belgium, all either Nazi collaborators or their families. He was {{also a member of}} the Rodolfo Freude-led División de Informaciones and in this <b>capacity</b> <b>initiated</b> the cases for resettlement for a number of Nazis.|$|R
40|$|With {{academics}} {{struggling to}} find the balance between research and teaching, {{there is a need}} to identify strategies that would assist academics in making the necessary changes to manage their time. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a strength-based change process based on the premise that academics are change agents who possess knowledge and experience that can make a difference. This article proposes an AI methodological framework for an academic development strategy focussing on integrating research into teaching. Currently, few measures exist that focus on assisting academics in incorporating research into their teaching and learning practices. The article aims to describe the strategies used to initiate a process that builds on the positive experiences of academics in teaching in an environment where academics may become overwhelmed when focussing only on barriers. The process described focuses on the aims of the academic development programme at each stage as well as the roles of the participants. The AI approach is a novel framework that can be used to <b>initiate</b> research <b>capacity</b> building among academics. Department of HE and Training approved lis...|$|R
30|$|In CDMA, each user uses {{a unique}} code {{sequence}} that allows multiple users {{to share the}} system bandwidth. The codes used for CDMA should have low or zero cross-correlation in order to overcome multiple access interference and multipath interference, which limits {{the capacity of the}} current 3 G system to half of its processing gain (PG) [2]. The major limitation of existing signature sequences [3], such as Gold codes, M-sequence, Kasami sequence, and Walsh-Hadamard sequence, are that they are no longer orthogonal in real-time scenarios such as uplink transmission, multiple access, and multipath interference which reduces the system <b>capacity,</b> <b>initiating</b> the need for perfect orthogonal codes.|$|R

This study evaluates policy integration of human {{resource development}} (HRD) in ag-ricultural sector {{within the context}} of multi-level governance (i. e., interdependence of administra-tive levels in decision making) and suggests means to enhance policy integration in Bangladesh. Conducting a critical review of major policy instruments, key informant interview and two case studies, this study concluded that HRD issue has fairly included and observed consistency (be-tween the aim of HRD and policy) in all policies and strategies; majority of policy instruments have significantly addressed the significance of HRD and added plans for its development; reporting, monitoring and evaluation of policies and strategies are rather weak and there is no adequate flow of financial arrangement that is largely determined by the availability of government project. Based on the findings, the following means should be useful for improving HRD policy integration such as providing a handsome amount of development budget at the sub-district agricultural of-fice, formulating coherent strategies to build effective cooperation, coordination and participation among stakeholders, <b>initiating</b> special <b>capacity</b> building programmes for rural women, youn...|$|R

Often large amounts of foundational work are necessary and dialogs among participants help clarify goals. The Social Discovery Framework suggests that (1) there are important processes in building capacity and then seeking solutions and (2) those that initiate requests are often as important as those who seek solutions. The implications of the Social Discovery Framework are that improved social tools to build <b>capacity,</b> <b>initiate</b> requests, and support dialog would accelerate the discovery process {{as much as the}} more visible tools for individuals seeking solutions.

Against such a backdrop, the Ministry of Community Development (which then included the arts and culture portfolio) explored ways to develop arts and culture in Singapore in the 1990s. In 1986, dramatist Kuo Pao Kun and Practice Performing Arts sent in a proposal for {{the conversion of the}} disused building to an arts center. It was accepted. Also in 1986, the building, together with the adjacent Tao Nan School (now the Peranakan Museum) and the shophouses along Armenian Street (now used by National Heritage Board), were earmarked for conservation under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Civic and Cultural Master Plan.|$|R
40|$|Organizations, {{including}} governments, in {{the world}} today are taking advantage of the many opportunities provided by modern Information and communication technologies (ICTs). To libraries, ICTs present an opportunity to provide value-added information services and access {{to a wide variety of}} digital-based information resources to their clients. Further, libraries are also using modern ICTs to automate their core functions, implement efficient and effective library cooperation and resource sharing networks, implement management information systems, develop institutional repositories of digital local content, and digital libraries; and <b>initiate</b> ICT-based <b>capacity</b> building programmes for library staff and information literacy programmes for library users. However, for most libraries in sub-Saharan Africa, including the SCANUL-ECS region, use of ICTs is largely restricted to traditional library automation, i. e. replacing manual operations by computerised methods. Innovative use of information and communication technologies in libraries is not widespread and it is made difficult, if not impossible, by several challenges or constraints, including lack of funds to sustain the ICT infrastructure, inability by librarians/libraries to keep up with the pace of developments in ICTs, inadequate ICT facilities in the libraries, lack of staff with appropriate skills to manage ICTs both at the strategic and operational levels, absence of institutional policies and strategies to support and guide the use of ICTs, and lack of adequate knowledge and skills to manage digital information resources and to deal with issues relating to copyright intellectual property rights in a digital information environment...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{worldwide}} interest in renewable electricity technologies (RETs) due to growing concerns {{about global warming}} and climate change. As an EU candidate country whose energy demand increases exponentially, Turkey inevitably shares this common interest on RET. This study, using an aggregate economic equilibrium model, explores the economic costs of different policy measures to mitigate CO 2 emissions in Turkey. The model combines energy demands, capital requirements and labor inputs at a constant elasticity of substitution under an economy-wide nested production function. Growing energy demand, triggered by economic growth, is met by increased supply and <b>initiates</b> new <b>capacity</b> additions. Investment into RET is encouraged via the incorporation of (a) endogenous technological learning through which the RET cost declines {{as a function of}} cumulative capacity, and (b) a willingness to pay (WTP) function which imposes the WTP of consumers as a lower bound on RET installation. The WTP equation is obtained as a function of consumer income categories, based on data gathered from a pilot survey in which the contingent valuation methodology was employed. The impacts of various emission reduction scenarios on GDP growth and RET diffusion are explored. As expected, RET penetration is accelerated under faster technological learning and higher WTP conditions. It is found that stabilizing CO 2 emissions to year 2005 levels causes economic losses amounting to 17 % and 23 % of GDP in the years 2020 and 2030, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{within and}} outside of the {{pharmacy}} profession frequently arise about a community pharmacy’s capacity to provide patient-care services and maximize contributions to public health. It is surmised that community pharmacy locations must possess specific attributes and have identifiable resources within the location to effectively initiate and optimize their capacity to deliver patient care services in conjunction with medication distribution and other services. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe three research domains that can help pharmacies make the transition from “traditional” business models to “patient care centered” practices: (1) Work System Design, (2) Entrepreneurial Orientation, and (3) Organizational Flexibility. From these research domains, we identified 21 Work System Design themes, 4 dimensions of Entrepreneurial Orientation, and 4 types of Organizational Flexibility that can be used in combination to assist a practice location in transforming its business model to a “patient care centered” practice. The self-assessment tools we described in this paper could help realign an organization’s activities to <b>initiate</b> and optimize <b>capacity</b> for patient care...|$|R
