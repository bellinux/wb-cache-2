40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{identify}} store <b>format</b> <b>attributes</b> that impact on store format choice when consumers conduct fill-in or major trips to buy groceries. By doing so, we take into consideration that consumers patronise multiple (store-based) formats depending on the shopping situation operationalised {{by the type of}} shopping trip. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts the conceptual framework of random utility theory via application of a multinomial logit modelling framework. The analysis is based on a survey of 408 consumers representing households in a clearly defined central European retail area. Findings: The results reveal a considerable moderating effect of the shopping situation on the relationship between perceived store <b>format</b> <b>attributes</b> and store <b>format</b> choice. Consumers’ utilities are significantly higher for discount stores and hypermarkets when conducting major trips. To the contrary, supermarkets are preferred for fill-in trips in the focused retail market. Merchandise-related <b>attributes</b> of store <b>formats</b> have a higher impact on the utility formation regarding major-trips, whereas service- and convenience-related attributes do so regarding fill-in trips. Research limitations: The findings can only be generalised to retail markets having similar characteristics like the one under study. It is highly concentrated, contains considerable share of small size retail stores, it is urban and has clear cut boundaries due to its geographical location.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss archival storage {{container}} formats {{from the point of}} view of digital curation and preservation, an aspect of preservation overlooked by most other studies. Considering established approaches to data management as our jumping off point, we selected seven container <b>format</b> <b>attributes</b> that are core to the long term accessibility of digital materials. We have labeled these core preservation attributes. These attributes are then used as evaluation criteria to compare storage container formats belonging to five common categories: formats for archiving selected content (e. g. tar, WARC), disk image formats that capture data for recovery or installation (partimage, dd raw image), these two types combined with a selected compression algorithm (e. g. tar+gzip), formats that combine packing and compression (e. g. 7 -zip), and forensic file formats for data analysis in criminal investigations (e. g. aff – Advanced Forensic File format). We present a general discussion of the storage container format landscape in terms of the attributes we discuss, and make a direct comparison between the three most promising archival formats: tar, WARC, and aff. We conclude by suggesting the next steps to take the research forward and to validate the observations we have made...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a text block extraction algorithm that takes as its input {{a set of}} text lines of a given document, and partitions the text lines into a set of text blocks, where each text block {{is associated with a}} set of homogeneous <b>formatting</b> <b>attributes,</b> e. g. text-alignment, indentation. The text block extraction algorithm described in this paper is probability based. We adopt an engineering approach to systematically characterising the text block structures based on a large document image database, and develop statistical methods to extract the text block structures from the image. All the probabilities are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements among the text lines, and among the text blocks in the training data set. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the on-line text block extraction. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. To evaluate the performance of our text block extraction algorithm, we used a three-fold validation method and developed a quantitative performance measure. The algorithm was evaluated on the UW-III database of some 1600 scanned document image pages. The text block extraction algorithm identifies and segments 91 % of text blocks correctly...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} popularity of conjoint analysis in health outcomes research, {{little is known}} about what specific methods are being used for the design and reporting of these studies. This variation in method type and reporting quality sometimes makes it difficult to assess substantive findings. This review identifies and describes recent applications of conjoint analysis based on a systematic review of conjoint analysis in the health literature. We focus on significant unanswered questions for which there is neither compelling empirical evidence nor agreement among researchers. We searched multiple electronic databases to identify English-language articles of conjoint analysis applications in human health studies published since 2005 through to July 2008. Two independent reviewers completed the detailed data extraction, including descriptive information, methodological details on survey type, experimental design, survey <b>format,</b> <b>attributes</b> and levels, sample size, number of conjoint scenarios per respondent, and analysis methods. Review articles and methods studies were excluded. The detailed extraction form was piloted to identify key elements {{to be included in the}} database using a standardized taxonomy. We identified 79 conjoint analysis articles that met the inclusion criteria. The number of applied studies increased substantially over time in a broad range of clinical applications, cancer being the most frequent. Most used a discrete-choice survey format (71 %), with the number of attributes ranging from 3 to 16. Most surveys included 6 attributes, and 73 % presented 7 - 15 scenarios to each respondent. Sample size varied substantially (minimum[*]-[*] 13, maximum[*]-[*] 1258), with most studies (38 %) including between 100 and 300 respondents. Cost was included as an attribute to estimate willingness to pay in approximately 40 % of the articles across all years. Conjoint analysis in health has expanded to include a broad range of applications and methodological approaches. Although we found substantial variation in methods, terminology, and presentation of findings, our observations on sample size, the number of attributes, and number of scenarios presented to respondents should be helpful in guiding researchers when planning a new conjoint analysis study in health.

Besides, kinds and formats of one data depend on institutions and medical experts (inspectors, physicians, and creators of materials). In our paper, we select a target disease to consider the disease-specific characteristics. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an urgent disease that physicians should make a rapid decision about a patient’s condition and determine procedures from their information in the golden time.
