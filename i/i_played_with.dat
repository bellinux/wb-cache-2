He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
500|$|Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, [...] "I don't {{know how}} to put into words how {{fortunate}} I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

500|$|Like Harford, Graham had issues {{selecting}} his side, {{going as}} far to say [...] "it's the hardest line-up I {{have had to}} choose." [...] Already without O'Leary, Graham was waiting for Paul Davis to pass a fitness test before finalising his first eleven; the England international had caught a virus {{a week before the}} final and subsequently missed training. Arsenal defender Gus Caesar, who deputised for O'Leary, relished the challenge of being up against Harford: [...] " [...] is aggressive, but I'm not worried. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> Tony Adams for two years in the youth team. We can always draw on that experience. It's instinctive." ...|$|E
500|$|They also {{recognized}} the importance of a name: agreeing it should be one suitable for the organization envisioned. To Reynard fell the task of finding such a name. [...] In explaining how she came up with the nautical name, Reynard said: [...] "I realized that there were two letters which had to be in it: W for women and V for volunteer, because the Navy wants {{to make it clear that}} this is a voluntary service and not a drafted service. So <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> those two letters and the idea of the sea and finally came up with Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service – WAVES. [...] I figured the word Emergency would comfort the older admirals because it implies that we're only a temporary crisis and won't be around for keeps." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greg's a very {{different}} character. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> him on debut, I captained him, but he's never been my kind of person.

However, he {{more than made up}} for that on the offensive end with a huge repertoire of offensive skills:dead-eye shooter from up to 20 feet, great offensive moves from the mid-post, automatic from the free throw line, and maybe the best head and shoulder fake {{in the history of the}} PBA." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1937, Red Cagle, {{a member}} of the College Football Hall of Fame, rated Strong at the {{greatest}} all-around football player. Cagle said: [...] "Strong [...] [...] [...] can do everything.

When Sully talked about some producers he is interested in working with, Shannon suggested Dave Fortman, [...] "Got the mighty Dave Fortman producing who had made it before in a band called Ugly Kid Joe. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> him for five years, toured the world with him. Love the guy, he's one of the funniest dudes ever. After Sully met Dave it was pretty much over because Dave is such a real pleasant guy to be around and real funny, makes you feel comfortable in all ways," [...] Shannon said.|$|E
2500|$|On {{his days}} in big band/swing music: [...] "It's really so long ago, one {{ought to be able}} to invoke a statute of limitations. <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. So I get calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who ask me about this period of my life as though it were the present. But I've moved on to other things." ...|$|E

Her family originated in Saxony, but had settled in Poland during the eighteenth century during {{the rule of the}} House of Wettin. Gertz's father had taken part in the January Uprising in 1863-64, and Gertz grew up hearing the stories of her father and his friends. Years later she wrote: [...] "As a five-year-old girl I had never had any dolls, only innumerable toy soldiers, which my older brother, his friends and <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with.</b> Even then, I knew that high rank was not for girls.

2500|$|Early into New York Islanders {{training}} camp, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, having {{played the}} previous {{season in the}} KHL, was deeply saddened by the news and {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I think I knew 80 percent of the team. Either <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> them or I played against them. You see each other in different tournaments. Some of them you're really close with, or some them you just say hi and have a couple of laughs with. [...] It struck me when I found out. I was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough. You have chills and you just hope that the families will find the strength to fight through something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Blackman had an {{opportunity}} to work with Lenny Kravitz. From New York, Blackman talked over the phone with Kravitz in Los Angeles, and played drums for him as he listened. Kravitz immediately asked Blackman to fly out to LA. [...] "Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone", Blackman says. [...] "So I put the phone down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH-BOOSH-bat, and I went back to the phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'" [...] "I flew out the next morning. While I'm downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an audition'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first video that I did with him, [...] "Are You Gonna Go My Way".

2500|$|After his {{football}} career ended, Ortmann accepted {{a job with}} a Chicago nonferrous metals company owned by former Michigan All-American Ernie Vick. Ortmann retired in 1991 and moved to Savannah, Georgia. He was married to his high school sweetheart from Milwaukee, Betty Ortmann; they had four children. They settled in Glen Ellyn where, Chuck established a youth football program. Together with Tom Hoffman, Chuck coached both the Churchill Blue Raiders and Glen Ellyn Rams. During the Rams' first year, Larry Krupp served as student manager of the team. In 2004, Ortmann was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. Asked about the honor, Ortmann modestly said: “When fans start talking about putting an all-time Michigan team together, I think they're wrong to pick someone from the old era. I led the Big Ten one year with 750 yards running and passing. A guy like John Navarre has as many yards and passes in a game as I did in a season. Guys <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>with</b> were as good as they come, but nothing like the players today. Dominic Tomasi was a lineman at 5-8 and 180 pounds. They have cheerleaders that big today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Smith, {{the song}} [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Play</b> <b>with</b> Madness" [...] "actually started {{life as a}} ballad I {{had been working on}} called 'On the Wings of Eagles'. Then Bruce had a verse for it but wanted to change the title to 'Can <b>I</b> <b>Play</b> <b>with</b> Madness.' <b>I</b> must admit, it did sound better that way. So we took that one and Steve liked it, too. It was Steve {{who came up with the}} time change in the middle and the {{instrumental}} passage, which again gave it that lift it needed." [...] According to Dickinson, however, Harris' addition resulted in [...] "a big row ... Adrian absolutely hated it." ...|$|R
