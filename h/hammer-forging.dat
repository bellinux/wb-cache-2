50|$|The HK416's barrel is cold hammer-forged with a 20,000-round {{service life}} and {{features}} a 6 grooves 178 mm (7 in) right hand twist. The cold <b>hammer-forging</b> process provides a stronger barrel for greater safety {{in case of}} an obstructed bore or for extended firing sessions. Modifications for an over-the-beach (OTB) capability such as drainage holes in the bolt carrier and buffer system are available to let the HK416 fire safely after being submerged in water.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 Weatherby {{went back}} to Europe to visit J.P. Sauer & Sohn, which {{was at the time}} {{primarily}} a shotgun manufacturer. Udo van Meeteren wanted not only to manufacture the action but also the complete rifle as well. Within two months of the visit a contract with J.P. Sauer & Sohn was signed. In 1958 Fred Jennie visited the Sauer plant in Eckernförde, Germany to help with the setup process. At this time it was decided that receiver and bolt would be made from forgings instead of the investment casting process as Sauer was more familiar with the process. Rifle barrels would be hammer-forged by Sauer, which promoted greater uniformity from breech to muzzle and which in turn led to greater accuracy and longer barrel life. By employing this method of <b>hammer-forging</b> barrels, Weatherby became the first U.S. company to offer hammer-forged barrels in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|FN Special Police Rifles of all {{iterations}} {{are noted}} for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome-lined bore in the barrel. A chrome-lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier-to-clean barrel {{for the end}} user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt-action sniper rifles. The barrels of the [...] "First Generation" [...] rifles {{were said to be}} made from the <b>hammer-forged</b> blanks used for M240 General Purpose Machine Gun production at the FN Manufacturing Inc. plant in Columbia, South Carolina. Later barrels are said to be from <b>hammer-forged</b> blanks intended exclusively for FN Special Police Rifle production.|$|R
50|$|Concerns that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry {{had with}} the C8 led to the {{creation}} of the C8FTHB.

5000|$|The Ruger American has a {{receiver}} made from 4140 chrome-moly bar stock and a <b>hammer-forged</b> barrel with a blued black oxide finish, mounted onto a black polymer composite stock. Rather than using a traditional recoil lug, the rifle's barreled action is secured {{in the stock}} by a bedding system known as [...] "Power Bedding®", which uses two V-shaped aluminium action block that wedges the receiver firmly in place and allows the barrel to be free-floated.|$|R
50|$|The cold <b>hammer-forged</b> barrel has a {{hexagonal}} polygonal bore. It comes rifled {{for either}} the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178 mm (1:7 in) or in a 305 mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile.

50|$|The SSG 2000 {{is derived}} from the Sauer 80/90 target rifle. It has a bolt action with {{rotating}} handle, but non-rotating bolt. When the handle is rotated to close the action, six lugs are driven onwards from the rear part of the bolt body to lock into the receiver. The action also features a loaded chamber indicator.

Barrel lengths of the two calibers are exactly the same. The Barrels are <b>hammer-forged</b> and hardened with a nitriding process rather than having chrome plated bores as some other rifles.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>hammer-forged</b> barrel has {{a female}} type {{polygonal}} rifling with a right-hand twist. The stabilization {{of the round}} is not by conventional rifling, using lands and grooves, but rather through a polygonal profile consisting {{of a series of}} six or eight interconnected noncircular segments (only the [...]45 ACP and [...]45 GAP have octagonal polygonal rifling). Each depressed segment within the interior of the barrel is the equivalent of a groove in a conventional barrel. Thus, the interior of the barrel consists of smooth arcs of steel rather than sharply defined slots.|$|R
2500|$|First {{developed}} in Italy, the stiletto {{dates from the}} late 15th century, and {{is thought to be}} a development of the rondel dagger or misericordia, a needle-pointed weapon with a narrow blade designed primarily for thrusting, though possessing cutting edges. [...] Early stilettos normally used a one-piece cast-metal handle which was shaped and turned on a lathe. [...] The stiletto blade was usually <b>hammer-forged</b> into a dense rod with a narrow, triangular cross section, without any sharpened edges. However, other examples of the period have emerged bearing round, square, or diamond cross sections.|$|R

5000|$|The L39A1 was a target-shooting variant {{produced}} for military full-bore shooting teams. It {{was similar to}} the L42A1, except it was fitted with Parker-Hale target tunnel front and micrometer-adjustable rear sights in lieu of the telescopic sight, and the butt had a curved pistol grip similar to the butt used on the No.8 [...]22 rifle. Since magazine loading was not required, the L39A1 had a [...]303 British magazine, the follower of which served as a loading platform for single shot use.

The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: [...] "normal" [...] for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and [...] "adverse"—used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low pressure ammunition.|$|R
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily.

5000|$|In 2002, {{catering}} to long range varmint and target shooters, Remington introduced the 5-R [...] "Mil-Spec" [...] as a small-quantity production run stainless steel rifle, matched to a non-adjustable H-S Precision stock with an aluminum bedding block with two forward sling swivel studs. The [...] "Mil-Spec" [...] refers {{solely to the}} 5-R rifling profile designed by Boots Obermeyer and used in the single broach-cut barrels he produces {{for use in the}} M24, M40, and other sniper rifle systems. The contour of the <b>hammer-forged</b> production Remington barrel is much thinner than that used in the M24 and M40 rifle systems.|$|R
