According to special relativity too, the aether was absolute, since its influence on inertia and the propagation of light was thought of as being itself independent of physical influence....The theory of relativity resolved this problem by establishing the behaviour of the electrically neutral point-mass by the law of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>line,</b> according to which inertial and gravitational effects are no longer considered as separate. In doing so, it attached characteristics to the aether which vary from point to point, determining the metric and the dynamic behaviour of material points, and determined, in their turn, by physical factors, namely the distribution of mass/energy. Thus the aether of general relativity differs from those of classical mechanics and special relativity in that it is not ‘absolute’ but determined, in its locally variable characteristics, by ponderable matter.

As an example, the Schwarzschild solution of the spherical symmetry gravitational field is transformed into flat space-time to study. The results show that there exists no any singularity in the all processes and the whole space-time including at the point r= 0.

Most applications in geographical information systems (GIS) involve maps of this type: they arise from <b>geodetic</b> <b>lines,</b> latitude-longitude grids, stereographic projection of plane polygons, satellite images, etc [4].

40|$|The area {{calculation}} of geodetic polygonal {{is a compelling}} mathematical challenge. How could one calculate the area of a polygon over the ellipsoid, if the sides do not have known parameterization?

Such methods near the ellipsoidal reference surface by other of easier mathematical treatment, but have limited employment, for a single surface cannot {{be used for the}} entire planet, without compromising the calculations over it.

Since most geodetic surveys are developed using GPS equipment, the data input is based on (X, Y, Z) coordinates, using WGS- 84 datum, providing the geodetic area without needing a GIS product. In order to achieve the paper objective, it was developed a different parameterization from the classical geometric Geodesy approach, to map the (X, Y, Z) coordinates to the geodetic ones.

40|$|Locations such as <b>geodetic</b> <b>lines,</b> {{geographical}} extreme {{points and}} national boundaries fascinate tourists {{because of their}} specific character, and therefore many of these have become significant tourist attractions and resources for tour-ism development. The aim {{of this paper is}} to conceptualize specific locations, and to analyse their development from a point or a line into a tourist attraction. In addition, the production of specific character is discussed. The transformation of specific locations into tourist attractions is approached through four cases in Northern Europe. Each of the cases is discussed using Dean MacCannell’s mod-el of sight sacralization in order to test its applicability in the empirical context. It is noted that specific locations develop into attractions in a series of stages, but the model of sight sacralization does not fully explain their transformation or their specific character. The stages may occur in different order, they can be overlapping or same stage can take place several times during the process. Fur-thermore, the development of specific locations does not end to the last stage of the model. It is suggested that specific locations should be approached more widely through social and political processes that influence their production and development...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the algebra and {{the basis of}} {{corresponding}} analysis in 4 -dimensional spaces are constructed, in pseudoeuclidean with signature (1, - 1, - 1, - 1) and pseudo-Riemannian corresponding to the real space-time. In both cases the analogues of Cauchy-Riemann conditions are obtained. They are the systems of 1 -st order partial differential equations, linear for the pseudoeuclidean and quasi-linear for the pseudo-Riemannian space (linear as about the components of differentiable function ant its derivatives so about the derivatives of metric tensor). The general solution for pseudoeuclidean space which is the flat waves of components of dependent function, and special (spherical-symmetric) wave-like (as for the components of differentiable function so for the components of metric tensor) solution for the pseudo-Riemannian space are got. In the last case the absence of central singularity for the components of metric tensor is interesting. From the Cauchy-Riemann condition follows that the differentiable function is constant along some isotropic curves given by 1 -st order differential equations. The demand these curves to be <b>geodetic</b> <b>lines</b> leads to the differential restrictions for the metric tensor itself. The special kind of these restrictions is obtained. The hypothesis that the differentiable function {{can be interpreted as}} an electromagnetic field is expressed. Comment: 44 page...|$|R

Major progress was achieved in the development of software tools, which enable obtaining spatial data from series of images taken from different perspectives.

The main goal of this thesis is to get familiar with the Insight 3 D application and to build a 3 D model of the selected object in fourth level of detail (LOD 3) according to the CityGML standard.

The largest part of the thesis comprises of the photogrammetrically captured data processing and the description of encountered difficulties while working with the Insight 3 D application.

We employed data from a first-order <b>geodetic</b> levelling <b>line</b> measured in 1951, 1992 and 1998. The line bears a record of pre-seismic and coseismic strains associated with the causative fault of the 1997 September 26, 09 : 40 mainshock (Mw = 6. 0). A first level analysis performed under the assumption of slip homogeneity of coseismic slip shows misfits that cannot be reduced simply by altering the fault size and geometry. A more detailed analysis based on a distribution of coseismic slip obtained from broad-band seismograms provides a better fit and is in agreement with 1951 – 1992 elevation changes interpreted as precursory slip by previous investigators. The levelling data sets new constraints on the location, extent, dip and depth of the fault, in full agreement with seismological evidence and images from SAR interferometry. The data show no evidence for slip in the uppermost 3 km of the crust, suggesting that a major and widely recognized normal fault {{that exists in the}} area is no longer active and showing a tendency of present tectonic strains to revert the current topographic setting...|$|R
