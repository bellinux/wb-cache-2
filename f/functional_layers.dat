50|$|They are {{structurally}} {{organized and}} linked {{together in a}} provisional physical structure, outlining a distinctive and specific morphology. Actually, it is the architecture of their ligands, which provides a certain physical and provisional arrangement of the CAS every time different. Moreover, the CAS is also a single energy entity; accordingly with this assumption, a more efficient and sustainable urban form emerges through modification of its elements and integration of its subsystems over time. In IMM holistic methodology, the final system performance results from the whole elements; moreover, the city reshapes itself through a dynamic and on-going adaptation process of its constituents. The IMM process highlights the transformation of mid-scale areas, which is a determined area and acts as {{a bridge between the}} local scale and global scale. However, the limit of this area has to be mapped, as the intervention and project site by the designers and planners. The main criterion to confine the intervention's border is based on the wide-ranging contextual features, such as morphological aspects, social and <b>functional</b> <b>layers.</b> In IMM theory the modification of CAS elements, which causes the final transformation of the system, occurs in different scales. Equally, the urban interventions are operated in different scales. As the modifications of CAS are classified in the local, intermediate and global scale, any intervention effect has to be considered in the three mentioned scales. The intermediate interventions bridge the gap between local and global scales. Hence, the IMM (Integrated Modification Methodology) acted to transform locally a neighbourhood in order to start a reaction involving the entire urban context and changing the CAS structurally.|$|E
