40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} fracture resistance and microleakage of reattached anterior tooth fragment using two different flowable composites. Study Design: In-vitro study. Place and Duration of Study: The present in vitro study {{was carried out in}} the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dental Sciences, SGT University, between June 2014 and July 2016. Methodology: The subjects were selected from various sources. A total of 160 extracted permanent anteriors were selected for the study. Teeth were divided into 2 groups, 80 teeth in each group reattached with G-aenial Universal Flo and Esthet X-Flow, evaluated for fracture resistance testing using Universal testing machine. Half number of teeth tested for microleakage using <b>Dye-penetration</b> <b>method.</b> The results obtained from the study were then tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: Mean value for fracture resistance in Group I were observed (89. 07 ± 32. 46) whereas in Group II were observed (64. 63 ± 40. 33). On statistical analysis result found to be highly significant (p = 0. 001). Out of 40 teeth, in Group I - 16 observed no penetration whereas in Group II - 10 teeth were observed no penetration. On Enamel-Dentin microleakage in Group I found to be in 6 teeth, whereas 14 teeth showed the same Enamel-Dentin penetration in Group II. But on statistical analysis, overall result found to be non-significant (p = 0. 19). Conclusion: Among the tested flowable composites, G-aenial Universal Flo showed highly significant fracture resistance than Esthet X-flow. Microleakage shows no significant differences between nanohybrid and microhybrid flowable composites...|$|E
