5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives <b>invest</b> <b>time</b> in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Honduras was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to Honduras desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest {{was based on the}} distribution of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up until the middle of the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established in Honduras were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. In Honduras, the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by mining activities. This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels in Honduras, with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to <b>invest</b> <b>time</b> and resources into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas in Honduras.|$|E

2500|$|As Díaz saw it, Indians impeded progress. It was {{not worth}} it to <b>invest</b> <b>time</b> and money to bring Indians out of their {{intellectual}} darkness and into a modern society through education. Díaz did not think Indians were biologically inferior to Europeans, but felt that centuries of subjugation had psychologically inhibited their ability to modernize. As mentioned in Creelman’s interview, Díaz claimed that Indians did not care to succeed {{because they could not}} see beyond the scope of a daily life. Indians needed a ruler to dictate their lives. However, this paternalistic approach to the Indian questioned turned from an issue of social welfare {{at the beginning of his}} presidency to one of indifference, so long as the economy kept progressing. On this point, Limantour and other científicos, played a great part because they “helped to alienate Díaz from the native peoples and this resulted in a growing indifference on the President’s part toward a wide sector of the population.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Farmers have widely adopted GM {{technology}} (see figure). Between 1996 and 2013, {{the total}} surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased {{by a factor of}} 100, from [...] to 1,750,000km2 (432 million acres). 10% of the world's arable land was planted with GM crops in 2010. As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain. One of the key reasons for this widespread adoption is the perceived economic benefit the technology brings to farmers. [...] For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. [...] Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then <b>invest</b> <b>time,</b> fuel, and equipment in applying them. [...] However critics have disputed whether yields are higher and whether chemical use is less, with GM crops. [...] See Genetically modified food controversies article for information.|$|E
2500|$|Rolf echoed similar sentiments in a 2013 {{article for}} Democracy, writing: [...] "If we <b>invest</b> <b>time,</b> energy, and capital into {{rigorous}} research, development, testing, and scaling up of new strategies and organizations that put workers' interests {{at the heart}} of our democracy, we can rebuild the American Dream. Now is a time for creativity and courage, risk and experimentation." [...] In 2013, The Seattle Times wrote that Rolf's mission is to persuade the more traditional leaders within the movement [...] "to accept that innovation is your new religion". He advocates for the use of social networking services by unions in order to engage young people, and believes that, like corporations, unions must invest in development, entrepreneurship and research in order to be successful in their efforts. Rolf believes [...] "a completely new and disruptive force" [...] is necessary to help the middle class, which will require [...] "bold moral and economic choices". He criticizes corporations that outsource or subcontract workers on a low-wage, part-time or temporary basis in order to avoid paying for the benefits required for full-time employees. Rolf has expressed concern about increased student loan debt, cost of housing increases that are greater than family income increases, and payroll tax increases during a time of simultaneous corporate tax decreases, and he is critical of trickle-down economics. He advocates for a $15-per-hour minimum wage to help address these issues. Rolf believes that minimum wage increases help local and small businesses.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this period}} Lisbon {{was a poor}} and dirty city {{compared}} to the cities of northern Europe. Almost all its commercial importance derived from the monopoly it held on {{the products of the}} Portuguese colonies, especially Angola and Mozambique. The country itself was described in London, Paris and Berlin as an extension of North Africa, meaning a territory unable to govern itself. The first large-scale emigrations began, and many thousands of poor Lisbons departed for Brazil, not to take government administrative jobs, but rather to rise from the lower levels of the Portuguese social scale: Despite the poverty and backwardness of most of the country, a rich upper class rose in Lisbon which spent lavishly and behaved as if it belonged to the elite of northern Europe, while governing a rural and backward country crippled by economic protectionism, and lacking systems to provide state-funded education and health care. With the decreasing importance of land as a factor of wealth, the landed aristocracy and gentry orbited the royal court, living luxuriously on allowances and salaries distributed by the state using taxes collected from the middle and lower classes. A regime [...] "of genteel manners" [...] was established which ceased political persecution, but also halted any reforms; corruption was routine and almost always went unpunished. Occasionally, an exceptional politician who was amenable to change and willing to <b>invest</b> <b>time</b> and effort to bring it about would appear in the succession of mostly idle and corrupt administrators. The Prime Minister Fontes Pereira de Melo reacted against protectionism and fought for economic liberalization and expanded industrialisation; various economic and industrial developments were encouraged under his leadership, which was focused primarily on the development of infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|Women’s {{views of}} antenatal {{screening}} {{have been widely}} researched, but men’s remain under-explored. The original contribution {{of this research was}} to conduct a mixed-methods study about men’s experiences specifically. In-depth interviews were firstly conducted with twelve men. Six women were interviewed about their views on men’s involvement. A grounded theory was developed, which was that men began developing a prenatal paternal identity and a schema of their child. These conceptualisations were reinforced or distorted by screening, causing their ideas and feelings about their growing family to be in a state of flux. To explore this theory with a more diverse group, a questionnaire was designed, pretested (n= 30), piloted (n= 53) and administered to 200 men. Exploratory factor analysis showed prenatal paternal identity and child-schema consisted of ‘bonding and closeness’, ‘genetic relationship’ and ‘imagined interactions’. Regression analyses showed <b>investing</b> <b>time</b> in screening, seeing more ultrasound scans, and making screening decisions, predicted higher scores on ‘bonding and closeness’. <b>Investing</b> <b>time</b> and being younger predicted higher scores on ‘genetic relationship’. <b>Investing</b> <b>time,</b> feeling fetal movements, being of a higher socioeconomic status and being younger predicted higher scores on ‘imagined interactions’. Longitudinal research is now required to identify implications for men, women and children. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
