40|$|Abstract Background Systems biology {{approaches}} to study metabolic switching in Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2) depend on cultivation conditions ensuring high reproducibility and distinct phases of culture growth and secondary metabolite production. In addition, biomass concentrations must be sufficiently high {{to allow for}} extensive time-series sampling before occurrence of a given nutrient depletion for transition triggering. The present study describes {{for the first time}} the development of a dedicated optimized submerged batch fermentation strategy as the basis for highly time-resolved systems biology studies of metabolic switching in S. coelicolor A 3 (2). Results By a step-wise approach, cultivation conditions and two fully defined cultivation media were developed and evaluated using strain M 145 of S. coelicolor A 3 (2), providing a high degree of cultivation reproducibility and enabling reliable studies of the effect of phosphate depletion and L-glutamate depletion on the metabolic transition to antibiotic production phase. Interestingly, both of the two carbon sources provided, <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> and L-glutamate, were found to be necessary in order to maintain high growth rates and prevent secondary metabolite production before nutrient depletion. Comparative analysis of batch cultivations with (i) both L-glutamate and <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> in excess, (ii) L-glutamate depletion and <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> in excess, (iii) L-glutamate as the sole source of carbon and (iv) <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> as the sole source of carbon, reveal a complex interplay of the two carbon sources in the bacterium's central carbon metabolism. Conclusions The present study presents for the first time a dedicated cultivation strategy fulfilling the requirements for systems biology studies of metabolic switching in S. coelicolor A 3 (2). Key results from labelling and cultivation experiments on either or both of the two carbon sources provided indicate that in the presence of <b>D-</b> <b>glucose,</b> L-glutamate was the preferred carbon source, while <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> alone appeared incapable of maintaining culture growth, likely due to a metabolic bottleneck at the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. </p...|$|R
30|$|Five wood {{species were}} acetylated with acetic {{anhydride}} (AA) solution of <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (GPA) at 120 °C for 8 h, {{and the effect}} of GPA on the dimensional stability of the acetylated wood was investigated. Some GPA was introduced into the wood cell wall during acetylation. The GPA remaining in the cell lumen penetrated the cell wall effectively after heating to more than 140 °C for 10 min. The bulking effects of GPA resulted in a 10 %– 30 % increase in the anti-swelling efficiency of the acetylated wood with 20 % GPA/AA solution in place of AA. Hydrophobic GPA did not deliquesce under highly humid conditions and it remained in the cell wall after boiling in water.|$|R
40|$|Perifused rat {{pancreatic}} islets, prelabelled with 45 Ca, {{were exposed}} for 90 min to a medium containing 30 mM K+, 0. 25 mM diazoxide and 0. 5 mM EGTA, but deprived of CaCl 2. Either verapamil (0. 05 mM) or Cd 2 + (0. 05 mM) were {{also present in}} the perifusate. Under these conditions a rise in <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> concentrations from either 2. 8 to 16. 7 mM or zero to 8. 3 mM increased both 45 Ca outflow and insulin release, after an initial and transient decrease in effluent radioactivity. These findings suggest that, in islets depolarised by exposure to a high extracellular concentration of K+, <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> provokes an intracellular redistribution of Ca 2 + ions and subsequent stimulation of insulin release. The functional response to <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> is apparently not attributable to either the closing of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, which were actually activated by diazoxide, or stimulation of Ca 2 + influx, which was prevented {{by the absence of}} extracellular Ca 2 +. The present experimental design thus reveals a novel component of the glucose-induced remodelling of Ca 2 + fluxes in islet cells. Such an effect might also be operative under physiological conditions, when the hexose leads to depolarisation of the islet B-cells. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The α and β <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetates</b> {{are known}} sugar derivatives, {{which can be}} {{potentially}} used as stabilizers of amorphous phase of active ingredients of drugs (API). In the present work, crystallization behavior of equimolar mixture of α and β form in comparison to both pure anomers is revealed. It was shown that despite the same molecular interactions and similar molecular dynamics, crystallization from amorphous phase is significantly suppressed in equimolar mixture. Time dependent X-ray diffraction studies confirmed higher stability of the quenched amorphous equimolar mixture. Its tendency to crystallization is about 10 times lower than for pure anomers. Calorimetric studies revealed that the α and β anomers don’t form solid solutions and have eutectic point for xα = 0. 625. Suppressed crystallization tendency in the mixture is probably caused by the altered thermodynamics of the system. The factors such as difference of free energy between crystalline and amorphous state or altered configurational entropy are probably responsible for the inhibitory effect...|$|R

Microbial degradation of cellulosic biomass is performed by mixtures of hydrolytic enzymes collectively known as cellulases.

3000|$|Spruce wood {{specimens}} were acetylated with {{acetic anhydride}} (AA) solutions of <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (GPA), and their viscoelastic properties along the radial direction {{were compared to}} those of the untreated and the normally acetylated specimens at various relative humidities and temperatures. Higher concentrations of the GPA/AA solution resulted in more swelling of wood when GPA was introducted into the wood cell wall. At room temperature the dynamic Young's modulus (E′) of the acetylated wood was enhanced by 10 % with the introduction of GPA, whereas its mechanical loss tangent (tan[*]δ) remained almost unchanged. These changes were interpreted to be an antiplasticizing effect of the bulky GPA molecules in the wood cell wall. On heating in the absence of moisture, the GPA-acetylated wood exhibited a marked drop in E′ and a clear tan[*]δ peak above 150 °C, whereas the E′ and tan[*]δ of the untreated wood were relatively stable up to 200 °C. The tan[*]δ peak of the GPA-acetylated wood shifted to lower temperatures with increasing GPA content, and there was no tan[*]δ peak due to the melting of GPA itself. Thus the marked thermal softening of the GPA-acetylated wood was attributed to the softening of wood components plasticized with GPA.|$|R

Analogs of natural products prepared in the laboratory have also shown significant biological effects. Laureatin, a major metabolite of a red marine algae of the genus Laurencia nipponica, has shown potent activity as a mosquito larvicide. We are interested in examining the potential of laureatin and its analogs as insecticides for mosquito vectors transmitting malaria.

40|$|BH 1115 is a gene from Bacillus halodurans strain C- 125 that hypothetically encodes a rhamnogalacturonan acetyl {{esterase}} (RGAE) of the CE- 12 family. As confirmation, {{this gene}} was cloned, {{and the product}} was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE 3) cells and purified. The enzyme obtained was monomeric, with a molecular mass of 45 kDa, and exhibited alkaliphilic properties. A study of the inhibition of the activity by some modulators confirmed that the catalytic triad for the esterase activity was Ser-His-Asp. This enzyme also presents broad substrate specificity and is active toward 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid, cephalosporin C, p-nitrophenyl acetate, β-naphthyl acetate, <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetate,</b> and acetylated xylan. Moreover, RGAE from B. halodurans achieves a synergistic effect with xylanase A toward acetylated xylan. As {{a member of the}} SGNH family, it does not adopt the common α/β hydrolase fold. The homology between the folds of RGAE from Aspergillus aculeatus and the hypothetical YxiM precursor from Bacillus subtilis, which both belong to the SGNH family, illustrates the divergence of such proteins from a common ancestor.

Deacetylation studies based on Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Time of Flight (LC-MS-TOF), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and spectrophotometric analysis showed that the tested esterases were able to deacetylate the plasticizer triacetin (glycerol triacetate) and <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetate</b> (cellulose acetate model compound). The most effective esterases for deacetylation belong to the enzyme family 2 (AXE 55, AXE 53, GAE), they deacetylated CA {{with a degree of}} acetylation of up to 1. 8.

40|$|We have cloned {{the gene}} cluster {{encoding}} three subunits of membrane- hound gluconate dehydrogenase (GADH) from Erwinia cypripedii ATCC 29267 in Escherichia coli by performing a direct-expression assay. The positive clone converted D-gluconate to 2 -keto-D-gluconate (2 KDG) {{in the culture}} medium. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the GADH clone revealed that the cloned fragment contained the complete structural genes for a 68 -kDa dehydrogenase subunit, a 47 -kDa cytochrome e subunit, and a 24 -kDa subunit of unknown function and that the genes were clustered with the same transcriptional polarity. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences and the NH 2 - terminal sequences determined for the purified protein indicated that the dehydrogenase, cytochrome c, and 24 -kDa subunits contained typical signal peptides of 22, 19, and 42 amino acids, respectively. The molecular masses of the processed subunits deduced from the nucleotide sequences (65, 45, and 20 kDa) coincided well with the molecular masses of subunits estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In E. cypripedii and recombinant E. coli, the GADH was constitutively formed and the activity of GADH was enhanced more than twofold by addition of D-gluconate to the medium.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effect of the dimethyl ester of succinic acid (SAD) upon the hormonal and metabolic response to a 60 -min exercise in overnight-starved Goto-Kakizaki rats. Twenty Goto-Kakizaki rats were starved overnight and then either maintained at rest or obliged to swim for 60 min. Half of the rats were injected intraperitoneally with the dimethyl ester of succinic acid (SAD, 5. 0 micromol g(- 1) body wt) immediately before exercise (or 60 min of rest). In the hereditarily diabetic rats, overnight starvation lowered the plasma <b>D-</b> <b>glucose,</b> insulin and lactate concentrations, while increasing that of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate. In resting rats, the injection of SAD increased the glycogen content of liver, heart and muscle and the plasma concentration of D-glucose, insulin, glycerol and free fatty acids. In control animals, not injected with SAD, exercise increased the plasma concentration of <b>D-</b> <b>glucose,</b> lactate and glycerol, whilst lowering both that of insulin and the glycogen content of liver, heart and muscle. The injection of SAD before exercise failed to prevent and, on occasion, even accentuated the changes in both the glycogen content of liver, heart and muscle and the plasma concentration of D-glucose, insulin, glycerol and free fatty acids, whilst minimizing the increase in lactate concentration otherwise caused by exercise. Nevertheless, the comparison between resting and exercising rats, both injected with SAD, suggested that the ester abolished the exercise-induced rise in D-glucose, glycerol and fatty acid concentrations. By comparison with comparable experiments conducted in overnight-starved normal rats, these findings emphasize both the difference between normal and diabetic rats in their metabolic response to exercise, especially in terms of changes in glycemia, and the usefulness of SAD to compensate for the increased consumption of endogenous nutrients during exercise.

While {{in the presence of}} 2 -DG the aberrations induced by bleomycin reduced significantly in PBL, the same was increased significantly in BMG cells (P< 0. 001) showing a protective effect and sensitizing effect on normal and tumor cells respectively. The dose modulatory factor (protection) for different concentration of bleomycin exposure varied between 0. 38 and 0. 72 for CA and 0. 1 and 0. 84 for MN in PBL.

Isolated perfused transgenic mouse hearts are commonly used to investigate the molecular regulation of heart metabolism; however, current methods to quantify cell surface glucose transporter content in intact mouse hearts are limited. Therefore, we developed a novel technique to directly assess the cell surface content of the cardiomyocyte glucose transporter GLUT 4 in perfused mouse hearts, using a cell surface impermeant biotinylated bis- glucose photolabeling reagent (bio- LC- ATB- BGPA). Bio- LC- ATB- BGPA was infused through the aorta and cross- linked to cell surface GLUTs.

Only one candidate, <b>glucose</b> <b>pentaacetate,</b> was found to melt {{in the presence of the}} gas mixture at 25 oC. The pressure of the system was ~ 6000 psia, which is unrealistically high for the commercial application of this process. Therefore mixed gas solubilities in the molten phase were not determined. In a second project, a strategy for using CO 2 -soluble compounds to decrease the mobility of dense CO 2 in porous media was investigated. It is to inject a CO 2 surfactant solution into the porous media, which contains both brine and oil, thereby generating a low mobility emulsion or foam of CO 2 droplets separated by surfactant-stabilized brine lamellae that bridge pore throats. In this work, the surfactants were screened by assessing their ability to stabilize foams when equal volumes of CO 2 and brine were mixed with the amount of surfactant capable of dissolving in the CO 2 at test conditions (e. g. 25 oC and 1300 psia). Stability was assessed by monitoring the rate of collapse of the foam and the appearance of clear zones of excess water and CO 2. We have established the identity of several non-ionic, hydrocarbon-based, commercially available, inexpensive surfactants that can dissolve in CO 2 at typical EOR reservoirs conditions to a high enough concentration (~ 0. 02 - 0. 20 wt%) to form relatively stable emulsions/foams of liquid or supercritical CO 2 droplets separated by films of brine. Although these surfactants are CO 2 -soluble, they are even more water-soluble, therefore they tend to partition into the low-volume brine phase and stabilize the emulsion form emulsions in which the brine is the low-volume (e. g. 10 vol%) continuous phase, in accordance with Bancroft¡¯s rule. The most effective thickeners were branched alkyl phenol ethoxylates, linear alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and linear alkyl ethoxylates. Linear ethoxylated alcohols was ineffective foam stabilizers...|$|R

METHODS: Twenty one endurance-trained males performed, in a double-blind fashion, two constant-load exercise tests to exhaustion at 63 +/- 5 % V(O 2) max in the heat (ambient temperature: 30. 3 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, relative humidity: 70 +/- 2 %) before and after 7 days of Cr (20 g. d- 1 Cr + 140 g. <b>d-</b> 1 <b>glucose</b> polymer) or placebo (Plc) (160 g. <b>d-</b> 1 <b>glucose</b> polymer) supplementation. RESULTS: 3 -way interaction has shown that Cr supplementation reduced rectal temperature, heart rate, ratings of perceived leg fatigue (P 0. 05; Cr group, n = 11 : 47. 0 +/- 4. 7 min vs. 49. 7 +/- 7. 5 min, P > 0. 05). However, after dividing the participants into "responders" and "non-responders" to Cr, based on their intramuscular Cr uptake, performance was higher in the "responders" relative to "non-responders" group (51. 7 +/- 7. 4 min vs. 47. 3 +/- 4. 9 min, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Although Cr influenced key modulators of brain 5 -HT and DA function and reduced various thermophysiological parameters which all {{may have contributed to}} the reduced effort perception during exercise in the heat, performance was improved only in the "responders" to Cr supplementation. The present results may also suggest the demanding of the pre-experimental identification of the participants into "responders" and "non-responders" to Cr supplementation before performing the main experimentation. Otherwise, the possibility of the type II error may be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Dextran {{is a long}} {{chain polymer}} of <b>D-</b> <b>Glucose</b> in which glucose {{molecules}} are linked with a- 1 â†’ 6 and a- 1 â†’ 3 linkages. Strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides {{is involved in the}} production of dextran through fermentation process. Nine strains of L. mesenteroides were isolated from different vegetables and fruit sources. L. mesenteroides PCSIR was selected for studies due to its high enzyme activity and dextran production with reference to commercial strain L. mesenteroides NRRL B- 512 F different media compositions used for dextran production showed that medium containing CaCI 2 (media- 4) produced dextran in high quantity compared with other media. Dextran production in medium- 4 clearly showed that the presence of magnesium and calcium salts in the medium not only effects the dextran production but also the enzyme activity. The viscosity of dextran produced in different media varied depending on the nature ofdextran. Dextran production is also effected by sucrose concentration in the media, higher the sucrose concentration higher is the yield of dextran per unit volume; however, the percentage conversion of sucrose to dextran decreased with increase in sucrose concentration. A continuous drop in pH was associated with growth and dextran production. The yield of dextran increased during the growth phase and maximum yield was obtained at the end of exponential phase. Time course study of dextransucrase showed that 18 hours incubation is the optimum time for obtaining maximum enzyme activity, after which there was a progressive decline in the enzyme activity. Maximum dextransucrase production was obtained when medium of pH 7. 5 was incubated at 26 Â°C for 18 hours. Maximum enzyme production was obtained when sucrose (2...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the possible link between plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase (PMCA) activity and D-glucose catabolism in insulin-producing cells, BRIN-BD 11 cells were transfected with two isoforms of PMCA 2. Transfection of insulin-producing BRIN-BD 11 cells with plasma membrane Ca 2 + -ATPase (PMCA 2 yb and PMCA 2 wb) was documented by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and 45 Ca 2 + uptake by microsomes. In the transfected cells, the overexpression of PMCA coincided with three major anomalies of D-glucose metabolism, namely a lower rate of D-[5 - 3 H]glucose utilization prevailing at a low extracellular concentration of D-glucose (1. 1 mM), a low ratio between D-[U- 14 C]oxidation and D-[5 - 3 H]glucose utilization prevailing at high extracellular glucose concentration (16. 7 mM), and a high ratio between the net generation of 14 C-labelled acidic metabolites and amino acids and that of 3 HOH from D-[5 - 3 H]glucose. These anomalies resulted in a decreased estimated rate of ATP generation (as linked to the catabolism of the hexose) and a lowered ATP cell content, whether at low or high extracellular D-glucose concentration. The net uptake of 45 Ca 2 + by intact cells was also decreased in the transfected cells, but {{to a greater extent}} than apparently attributable to the change in ATP generation rate. These findings document the relevance of plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase activity to both <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> metabolism and Ca 2 + handling in insulin-producing cells, with emphasis on the key role for both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca 2 + concentration in the regulation of D-glucose catabolism. They also reveal that over expression of PMCA leads, in insulin-producing cells, to an imbalance between ATP generation and consumption...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -kb region, located {{downstream}} of the Lactobacillus brevis xylA gene (encoding D-xylose isomerase), was cloned in Escherichia coli TG 1. The sequence revealed two open reading frames {{which could}} code for the D-xylulose kinase gene (xylB) and another gene (xylT) encoding a protein of 457 amino acids with significant similarity to the D-xylose-H+ symporters of E. coli, XylE (57 %), and Bacillus megaterium, XylT (58 %), to the D-xylose-Na+ symporter of Tetragenococcus halophila, XylE (57 %), {{and to the}} L-arabinose- H+ symporter of E. coli, AraE (60 %). The L. brevis xylABT genes showed an arrangement {{similar to that of}} the B. megaterium xylABT operon and the T. halophila xylABE operon. Southern hybridization performed with the Lactobacillus pentosus xylR gene (encoding the D-xylose repressor protein) as a probe revealed the existence of a xylR homologue in L. brevis which is not located with the xyABT locus. The existence of a functional XylR was further suggested by the presence of xylO sequences upstream of xylA and xylT and by the requirement of D-xylose for the induction of D-xylose isomerase, D- xylulose kinase, and D-xylose transport activities in L. brevis. When L. brevis was cultivated in a mixture of D-glucose and D-xylose, the D-xylose isomerase and D-xylulose kinase activities were reduced fourfold and the D- xylose transport activity was reduced by sixfold, suggesting catabolite repression by D-glucose of D-xylose assimilation. The xylT gene was functionally expressed in Lactobacillus plantarum 80, a strain which lacks proton motive force-linked D-xylose transport activity. The role of the XylT protein was confirmed by the accumulation of D-xylose in L. plantarum 80 cells, and this accumulation was dependent on the proton motive force generated by either malolactic fermentation or by the metabolism of <b>D-</b> <b>glucose.</b> The apparent affinity constant of XylT for D-xylose was approximately 215 μM, and the maximal initial velocity of transport was 35 nmol/min per mg (dry weight). Furthermore, of a number of sugars tested, only 6 -deoxy-D-glucose inhibited the transport of D-xylose by XylT competitively, with a K(i) of 220 μM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cytosolic Ca 2 + {{activity}} of mouse pancreatic β-cells was studied with the intracellular fluorescent indicator quin 2. When the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration was 1. 20 mM, the basal cytosolic Ca 2 + activity was 162 ± 9 nM. Stimulation with 20 mM glucose increased this Ca 2 + activity by 40 %. In {{the presence of}} only 0. 20 mM Ca 2 + or after {{the addition of the}} voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channel blocker <b>D-</b> 600, <b>glucose</b> had an opposite and more prompt effect in reducing cytosolic Ca 2 + by about 15 %. It is concluded that an early result of glucose exposure is a lowering of the cytosolic Ca 2 + activity and that this effect tends to be masked by a subsequent increase of the Ca 2 + activity due to influx of Ca 2 + through the voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at gaining {{further insight}} into the mode of action of {{repaglinide}} in pancreatic islet B-cells. At a 1. 0 μmol/L concentration, the meglitinide analog failed to affect the metabolism of exogenous D-glucose and that of endogenous nutrients in islets prelabeled with either L-[U- 14 C]glutamine or [U- 14 C]palmitate. Likewise, repaglinide (1. 0 μmol/L) failed to modify significantly the incorporation of L-[4 - 3 H]phenylalanine into TCA-precipitable material in islets exposed to a close-to-physiological concentration of D-glucose (7. 0 mmol/L). The threshold concentration for the insulinotropic action of repaglinide was close to 0. 1 - 1. 0 μmol/L and a maximal response was reached at 10. 0 μmol/L in islets incubated {{in the presence of}} 5. 6 - 8. 3 mmol/L D-glucose. At a higher hexose concentration (16. 7 mmol/L), however, an enhancing action of repaglinide (10 μmol/L) upon glucose-stimulated insulin release was only observed over 25 min stimulation in perifused islets, no significant increase in insulin output being detected when islets were exposed to repaglinide (0. 1 μmol/L to 0. 1 mmol/L) over 90 min incubation at the high D-glucose level. The increase in insulin output evoked by repaglinide in the islets perifused at 16. 7 mmol/L D-glucose coincided with a modest increase in 86 Rb outflow and a marked stimulation of 45 Ca efflux from prelabeled islets, suggesting stimulation of Ca 2 + influx into the islet cells and subsequent activation of Ca 2 +responsive K+ channels. When the administration of repaglinide was halted, the reversibility of its cationic and secretory effects was more pronounced in islets perifused at a high (16. 7 mmol/L), rather than a low (6. 0 mmol/L), <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> concentration. These findings support the view that the primary site of action of repaglinide consists in a remodeling of cationic fluxes, and document that this drug displays favorable attributes as an insulinotropic agent for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, such as its lack of interference with nutrient metabolism and biosynthetic activity in isolated islets, the low threshold concentration for its insulin-releasing action and its capacity to augment, at least transiently, insulin release at a high concentration of D-glucose.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} methodology for the synthesis of cyclic imine-sugars, and their use in the synthesis of aza-sugars as potential sugar-processing enzyme inhibitors. Our goals include the synthesis of cyclic imines of L-rhamnose, D-glucose, and L-idose stereochemistry, {{and the introduction of}} functionality via nucleophilic addition reactions. Work on the synthesis of cyclic imines commenced {{with the use of the}} simple model systems piperidme and 2 -methylpiperidine. N-Chlorination of these systems was performed and the products converted into their cyclic imine derivatives through elimination of HCl. Nucleophilic addition reactions to these systems were attempted, but the low stability and reactivity of the imines led to the isolation of only one adduct. The synthesis of novel cyclic pyrrolidine imine-sugars of L-rhamnose stereochemistry was performed by a Staudinger aza-Wittig reaction. The aza-Wittig reaction of a known L-rhamnose derived azido-sugar gave a novel cyclic L-rhamnopyrrolidine aldimine A novel synthesis of this azido-sugar was also devised. Successful nucleophilic additions to the cyclic L-rhamnopyrrolidine aldimine were performed with a range of Grignard reagents giving novel protected aza-sugars in good yields and with excellent diastereoselectivities. A novel cyclic L-rhamnopyrrolidme ketimine was also synthesised via a Staudinger aza-Wittig from a novel azido-sugar, although time constraints prevented screening this system with nucleophiles. The synthesis of novel cyclic piperidine imine-sugars of D-glucose, and L-idose stereochemistry was performed, both via N-chlorination/elimination of the protected parent aza-sugars, and via the Staudinger aza-Wittig reaction of novel azido-sugars. The elimination of HCl from six-membered iV-chloro aza-sugars of D-glucose and L- idose stereochemistry was investigated, and methodology developed in the case of <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> system for the regioselective elimination of HCl to give either the aldimme or the ketimine derivative. Comparison of elimination reactions of the N-chloro aza- sugars of D-glucose, and L-idose stereochemistry allowed rationalisation of the observed regiocontrol. Screening of the cyclic imines of D-glucose and L-idose stereochemistry with nucleophiles, followed by deprotection of the adducts, allowed the synthesis of novelaza-sugars via late-stage introduction of functionality. Low yields were obtained for these additions, but diastereocontrol was generally good, and could be rationalised by accepted stereoelectronic and steric approach control factors. The formation of cyclic piperidine imines of L-idose, and D-glucose stereochemistry was also performed via the Staudinger aza-Wittig reaction. These systems were found to be identical to those synthesised by the N-chlorination/elimination protocol. We also performed the first synthesis of the enantiomer of the natural product (+) - adenophorine thereby allowing assignment of the absolute configuration of the natural product (+) -adenophorine. The key synthetic step in this synthesis was stereoselective reduction of a novel intermediate cyclic piperidine ketimine-sugar of L-idose stereochemistry.

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to diabetes mellitus {{is associated with}} metabolic abnormalities such as chronic hyperglycemia and redox imbalance. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and genetic factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular diseases. Genetic mutation through the genes coding for enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and immuno-regulatory mechanisms {{may contribute to the}} susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) and its chronic microvascular diseases. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa 8 (NFκB) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) are two redox-sensitive cellular responses of most immune and inflammatory diseases including diabetes and its late vascular complications. NFκB promotes the transcription of a wide array of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. HSPs are proposed to have a cytoprotective effect; in contrast they have the capacity to promote pathogenic processes. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based microsatellite analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to genotype the genes coding for NFκB, HSP 70 -A 2, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) and protein kinase C- β(PKC-β). The A 10 allele of the NFκB gene and H 3 and H 7 alleles of the HSP 70 -A 2 gene were identified as risk markers of TIDM (P< 0. 01). These alleles were not associated with microvascular complications. No evidence of associations was obtained between either PKC-β or SORD genes with TIDM and its late complications. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia may alter the transcription mechanism of many genes, which control vascular homeostasis. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to assess the transcription factor, heat shock factor- 1 (HSF- 1) and NFκB-DNA binding activity in response to a concentration of 31 mM <b>D-</b> <b>glucose</b> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with TIDM with and without microvascular complications. Hyperglycaemia induced significant increases in both NFκB and HSF- 1 -DNA binding activities in PBMCs from patients (p= 0. 003 and 0. 017 respectively). The protein activity was more pronounced in PBMCs from patients with microvascular complications. Hyperglycaemia-induced NFκB-DNA binding activity was correlated to that of HSF- 1 (p< 0. 0 I). Patients with TIDM with microvascular complications demonstrated a significant increase in NFκB-DNA binding activity compared to patients with a short duration of diabetes (SD) or diabetic controls (DC) (p= 0. 003 and p = 0. 047 respectively). A significant positive correlation was found between the duration of diabetes and hyperglycaemia-induced NFκB-DNA binding activity (p= 0. 035). These results suggest that hyperactive flux through the polyol pathway is relevant to hyperglycaemia-induced protein activity since the aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) zopolrestat and sorbinil reduced HSF- 1 and NFκB-DNA binding activity in PBMCs. In conclusion, these results suggest that NFκB and HSP 70 -A 2 genes may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to TIDM. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia in diabetes may alter the transcription mechanism and magnify the proinflammatory responses, which accelerate the development of diabetic microvascular complications.
