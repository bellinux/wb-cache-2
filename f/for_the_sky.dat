5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
5|$|Seerey spent 1950 {{with the}} Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Western League.

He then {{finished}} the season with the Memphis Chickasaws, playing 136 total games with both teams. Seerey split most of the 1951 season between Memphis and Colorado Springs. In one game with the Sky Sox in June, Seerey had two grand slams and nine RBIs in a game, both league records at the time.

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of using}} several {{exposures}} to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered {{as early as the}} 1850s by Gustave Le Gray to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea.

Le Gray used one negative <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.|$|E
