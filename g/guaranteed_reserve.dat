40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the high-manganese austenite propensity to twinning induced by the cold working and its effect on structure and mechanical properties, and especially the strain energy per unit volume of new-developed high-manganese Fe-Mn-(Al, Si) investigated steels, including selected high-manganese austenitic TWIP steels containing 25 - 27. 5 % Mn, 1 - 4 % Si, 2 - 3 % Al, high-manganese TRIP steels containing 17 - 18 % Mn, about 1 % Si, about 3 % Al and selected high-manganese TRIPLEX steels containing 24 % Mn and about 11 % Al and some of that steels with Nb and Ti microadditions, with various structures after their heat- and thermo-mechanical treatments. Design/methodology/approach: The microstructure evolution in successive stages of deformation was determined in metallographic investigations using light, scanning and electron microscopies as well as X-ray diffractomiter. Findings: New-developed steels achieve profitable connection of mechanical properties, i. e. (ultimate tensile strength) UTS~ 800 - 1000 MPa, (yield strength) YS 0. 2 = 250 - 450 MPa, and plastic (uniform elongation) UEl = 35 - 90 %, and moreover, particularly strong formability and strain hardening occurring during forming. The new-developed highmanganese Fe-Mn-(Al, Si) steels provide an extensive potential for automotive industries through exhibiting the twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) mechanisms. Practical implications: The obtained microstructure - hot-working conditions relationships and stress-strain curves can be useful in determination of power-force parameters of hot-rolling for sheets with fine-grained austenitic structures. Originality/value: Results obtained for new-developed high-manganese austenitic steels with the properly formed structure and properties in the heat treatment- or thermo-mechanical processes indicate the possibility and purposefulness of their employment for constructional elements of vehicles, especially of the passenger cars to take advantage of the significant growth of their strain energy per unit volume which <b>guarantee</b> <b>reserve</b> of plasticity in the zones of controlled energy absorption during possible collision resulting from activation of twinning for TWIP steels, supported with martensitic transformation for TRIP steels, induced cold working, which may result in significant growth of the passive safety of these vehicles’ passengers...|$|R

40|$|As a left {{ventricular}} assist device {{is designed to}} pump against the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary congestion may occur when using such device for right ventricular support. The present study evaluates the efficacy of using a fixed right outflow banding in patients receiving biventricular assist device support under various circulatory conditions, including variations in the SVR, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), total blood volume (BV), as well as ventricular contractility. Effect of speed variation on the hemodynamics was also evaluated at varying degrees of PVR. Pulmonary congestion was observed at high SVR and BV. A reduction in right ventricular assist device (RVAD) speed was required to restore pulmonary pressures. Meanwhile, at a high PVR, the risk of ventricular suction was prevalent during systemic hypotension due to low SVR and BV. This could be compensated by increasing RVAD speed. Isolated right heart recovery may aggravate pulmonary congestion, as the failing left ventricle cannot accommodate the resultant increase in the right-sided flow. Compared to partial assistance, {{the sensitivity of the}} hemodynamics to changes in VAD speed increased during full assistance.

40|$|Multicast enables {{efficient}} {{data transmission}} from one source to multiple destinations, {{and has been}} playing {{an important role in}} Internet multimedia applications. Although several multicast scheduling schemes for packet switches have been proposed, they usually consider only short delay and high throughput but not bandwidth guarantees. However, fair bandwidth allocation is critical for the quality of service (QoS) of the network, and is necessary to support multicast applications requiring guaranteed performance services, such as online audio and video streaming. This paper addresses the issue of bandwidth guaranteed multicast scheduling on virtual output queued (VOQ) switches. We propose the Credit based Multicast Fair scheduling (CMF) algorithm, which aims at achieving not only short multicast latency but also fair bandwidth allocation. CMF uses a credit/balance based strategy to <b>guarantee</b> the <b>reserved</b> bandwidth of an input port on each output port of the switch. It keeps track of the difference between the reserved bandwidth and actually received bandwidth, and minimizes the difference to ensure fairness. Moreover, CMF supports multicast scheduling by allowing a multicast packet to send transmission requests to multiple output ports simultaneously. As a result, a multicast packet has more chances to be delivered to all its destinations in the same time slot, and thus shortens its multicast latency. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the performance of CMF with other existing scheduling algorithms, and the results demonstrate that CMF achieves the two design goals: short multicast latency and fair bandwidth allocation...|$|R
