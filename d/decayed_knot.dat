40|$|In {{the modern}} sawmill {{industry}} automatic grading {{of the products}} {{is one of the}} key issues in increasing the production quality. The surface defects that determine the grading are identified according to the physiological origin of the defect, such as dry, encased or <b>decayed</b> <b>knot.</b> Variations within the classes are large since the knots can have different shapes, sizes and color, and each class has different discriminating features. Classification of the defects using pattern recognition techniques has turned out to be rather difficult, since it is difficult to determine the suitable features that would correlate with the physiological defect types. In this paper we describe a wood defect classification system that is based on self-organizing feature construction and neural network classification. Due to the automatic, unsupervised learning of the features, the system is easily adaptable to different tasks, such as inspection of lumber or veneer, with different tree species and differen [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Previous work of {{the authors}} {{establishes}} a criterion on the fundamental group of a knot complement that determines when Dehn surgery on the knot will have a fundamental group that is not left-orderable. We provide a refinement of this criterion by introducing {{the notion of a}} decayed knot; it is shown that Dehn surgery on <b>decayed</b> <b>knots</b> produces surgery manifolds that have non-left-orderable fundamental group for all sufficiently positive surgeries. As an application, we prove that sufficiently positive cables of <b>decayed</b> <b>knots</b> are always <b>decayed</b> <b>knots.</b> These results mirror properties of L-space surgeries in the context of Heegaard Floer homology.

30|$|The {{results of}} this {{preliminary}} study on {{a small sample of}} trees indicate that the value recovery from individual logs was highly variable. The most important factors determining economic value of redwood trees are: log size (SED); pruning (pruned log PLI); and heartwood content. The amount of rot and insect damage (permitted only in merchantable timber grades) affects the financial value both pruned and unpruned logs (7 % in this case). Decrease in financial value due to the presence of dead branches (<b>decayed</b> <b>knots)</b> was less obvious than expected.|$|R

The band {{was joined by}} an eight-piece string section during the performance and a stage backdrop of <b>knotted,</b> <b>decaying</b> trees were placed on stage in order to showcase the [...] "powerful vocals" [...] by Amy Lee as stated by a writer of Billboard. The band additionally {{performed the}} song at Late Show with David Letterman in March 2004.|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{the young}} {{supernova}} remnant Cassiopeia A at a wavelength of 2 cm have resolved small knots. The flux density of these <b>knots</b> <b>decays</b> on a 1 /e time scale of about 14 yr. This is faster than the decay of the smooth features. The pressure in these knots can be estimated at 4 x 10 to the 7 th dynes/sq cm. This is somewhat greater than the pressure within the smooth component of the supernova remnant...|$|R
30|$|All the {{specimens}} were fabricated {{with the}} same batch wood from the same tree species with the frame tests. The material used was northeast larch of China and 15 clear samples without any defects such as <b>knots,</b> <b>decay</b> and cracks were made. Densities of these samples were 577  kg/m 3 and the average moisture content was 13.3 %. The samples were prepared at three orientations, namely the longitudinal, the radial and the tangential directions (Fig.  6). The dimensions of all the samples in three directions were 50  mm (Fig.  7).|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the local parity {{violation}} in the quark-gluon plasma supports existence of free (meta) stable knots of deconfined hot quark matter stabilized by superstrong magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the knots resembles the spheromak plasma state of the magnetic confinement approach to nuclear fusion. The size of the knot is quantized, being inversely proportional to the chiral conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma. The parity symmetry is broken inside the knot. Particles produced in the <b>decays</b> of the <b>knots</b> have unusual azimuthal distribution and specific flavor content. We argue that these knots may be created in noncentral heavy-ion collisions. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, RevTeX 4. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{striking}} qualitative similarity among the graphs of the relative probabilities of corresponding knot types across {{a wide range of}} random polygon models. In many cases one has theoretical results describing the asymptotic <b>decay</b> of these <b>knot</b> probabilities but, in the finite range, there is little theoretical knowledge and a variety of functional models have been used to fit the observed structures. In this paper we compare a selection of these models and study the extent to which each provides a successful fit for five distinct random knot models. One consequence {{of this study is that}} while such models are quite successful in this finite range, they do not provide the theoretically predicted asymptotic structure. A second result is the observed similarity between the global knot probabilities and those arising from small perturbations of three ideal knots. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the results of}} several years of testing the use of ultrasound to find structural defects in pallet parts and pallet cants used to produce pallet parts. To determine the magnitude of unsound defects, we inspected full length cants from seven saw mills from Virginia and West Virginia. Split, wane, shake, holes, <b>decay,</b> unsound <b>knots,</b> bark pocket, and mechanical defects were all considered as unsound defects. Regardless of mill and species, split {{accounted for the highest}} percentage of defect volume per cant. Decay: bark pockets, shake, and holes also contributed significantly to the total defect volume. The scanning results of deckboards, stringers and cants showed that ultrasound can be used effectively to locate, identify, and quantify the various pallet parts defects. Significant losses of ultrasound signals/energies were observed through these defects. Other ultrasound parameters, such as time of flight, pulse length can be used for characterizing defects. Reconstructed two-dimensional images were able to show the exact position and surface area of the defects. Defects can be classified/distinguished using classifying tools like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, and k-nearest neighbor. Results demonstrated that real-time, online inspection and classification of defects in wooden pallet parts are possible by ultrasound scanning. Results also showed that pallet cants can be graded by unsound wood content and that processing full length cants to cut-to-size cants can be optimized with the knowledge of defect size and location provided by the ultrasound scanning...|$|R
30|$|Instances {{of local}} damage in timber such as <b>knots,</b> <b>decay,</b> and cracks can be {{translated}} into a reduction of service life due to mechanical and environmental loadings. In wood construction, {{it is very important}} to evaluate the weakest location and to detect damage at the earliest possible stage to avoid future catastrophic failure. In this study, modal testing was used on wood beams to generate the first two mode shapes. A novel statistical algorithm was proposed to extract a damage indicator by computing mode shapes of vibration testing before and after damage in timbers. The different damage severities, damage locations, and damage counts were simulated by removing mass from intact beams to verify the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed statistical algorithm is effective and suitable for the designed damage scenarios. It is reliable for the detection and location of local damage of different severities, location, and number. The peak values of the damage indicators computed from the first two mode shapes were sensitive to different damage severities and locations. They were also reliable for the detection of multiple cases of damage.|$|R

40|$|Millions {{of wooden}} pallets are {{discarded}} annually due to damage or because their low cost makes them readily disposable. Higher quality wooden pallets, however, {{can be built}} from high quality deckboards and stringers, and have a much longer life cycle and a lower cost per trip. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an automated pallet part inspection system to sort pallet parts according to grade. Ultrasonic time of flight (TOF) measurements in a pitch-catch arrangement {{are being used to}} distinguish different types of defects, including <b>knots,</b> <b>decay,</b> cross grain, and voids, from clear wood. Rolling transducers of 3 different frequencies (84 KHz, 0. 5 MHz, and 1. 25 MHz) have been used to collect measurements on four oak deckboards of 1 / 2 ” thickness. Ultrasonic C-scans taken on a 1 / 2 ” × 1 / 2 ” grid indicate that TOF with 84 KHz transducers can be used to partially distinguish between several deckboard features and clear wood. Nevertheless, future application of these results to defect detection must not be limited to single, pixel value classification, but must include pixel neighborhoods with textural information...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} life {{of timber}} bridges is often shortened by decay of timber components and failure of timber connections. Consequently, periodic inspections must {{be carried out}} to identify potential problems. Reliable methods for in-situ assessment of the strength and degradation rate in terms of strength loss {{over a period of time}} are essential for maintenance and rehabilitation of wooden bridges. A nondestructive technique such as ultrasonic measurement and testing has been found to be more accurate than the conventional practice of visual inspection for assessing the condition of wooden members. Ultrasonic measurements have shown considerable promise in determining the stiffness and strength of wood members by identifying the presence of defects such as <b>knots</b> and <b>decay</b> [1, 2, 3]. Experimental results have shown significant differences between the velocities of ultrasonic signals in defect-free areas and areas with <b>knots,</b> <b>decays,</b> and other localized defects [4]. Halabe et al. [5, 6] has shown that frequency domain signal amplitude and wave attenuation measurements, when used in conjunction with time domain velocity measurements, can be much more accurate and reliable than simply using velocity measurements in predicting stiffness and condition of wood. Use of simple parameters such as area under FFT amplitude plots or power spectral density plots can greatly simplify comparison of various signals in the field...|$|R
40|$|The bond {{fluctuation}} {{method is}} used to simulate both nonconcatenated entangled and interpenetrating melts of ring polymers. We find that the swelling of interpenetrating rings upon dilution follows the same laws as for linear chains. Knotting and linking probabilities of ring polymers in semidilute solution are analyzed using the HOMFLY polynomial. We find an exponential <b>decay</b> of the <b>knotting</b> probability of rings. The correlation length of the semidilute solution {{can be used to}} superimpose knotting data at different concentrations. A power law dependence f n ∼ ϕR 2 ∼ ϕ 0. 77 N for the average number f n of linked rings per ring at concentrations larger than the overlap volume fraction of rings ϕ* is determined from the simulation data. The fraction of nonconcatenated rings displays an exponential decay POO ∼ exp(−f n), which indicates f n to provide the entropic effort for not forming concatenated conformations. On the basis of these results, we find four different regimes for the conformations of rings in melts that are separated by a critical lengths NOO, NC, and N*. NOO describes the onset of the effect of nonconcatenation below which topological effects are not important, NC is the crossover between weak and strong compression of rings, and N* is defined by the crossover from a nonconcatenation contribution f n ∼ ϕR 2 to an overlap dominated concatenation contribution f n ∼ ϕN 1 / 2 at N > N*. For NOO < N < NC, the scaling of ring sizes R ∼ N 2 / 5 results from balancing nonconcatenation with weak compression of rings. For NC < N < N*, nonconcatenation and strong compression imply R ∼ N 3 / 8. Our simulation data for noninterpenetrating rings up to N = 1024 are in good agreement with the prediction for weakly compressed rings...|$|R
