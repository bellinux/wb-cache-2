5|$|When Mansfield {{left the}} UK in June 1889, he was <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt because of {{production}} losses there. His debts included £2,675 owed to Irving, which Mansfield {{did not want}} to pay because he felt that Irving had not supported him adequately at the Lyceum. Irving sued, winning the UK performance rights to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Mansfield never performed in England again.|$|E

5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, Duke of York, now {{second in}} line to the throne, evidently became close to May during their shared period of mourning, and Queen Victoria still favoured May as a {{suitable}} candidate to marry a future king. In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, never took a mistress.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|In camp, Caesar welcomes Marcus Junius Brutus, his {{unofficial}} stepson {{whose mother}} is Caesar's lover, Servilia of the Junii. Later, {{at a party}} hosted by Servilia, Brutus confides to Pompey {{that the loss of}} the eagle has made Caesar unusually vulnerable as his men are on the brink of mutiny. On the road to Caesar's camp in Gaul, Octavian is taken captive by brigands. For Caesar's request, Atia instructs her daughter Octavia to marry Pompey by first divorcing her husband Glabius, despite Octavia's protests that they are <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> love. Atia then presents Octavia to Pompey at a party and offers her for premarital relations, which Pompey takes advantage of.|$|E
5|$|Iron Age and Roman remains {{have been}} found in the area. Steep {{formerly}} included a detached parish enclave called Ambersham, which lies <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> West Sussex. It was the only detached part of Hampshire and was returned to West Sussex when a new law came into effect in 1844. The church of All Saints was built around 1125. From medieval times, Steep was included in the parish of East Meon until it became an independent parish in 1867. Since 1899 the village has been the location of Bedales School, a progressive public school.|$|E

Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or be a father. She concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets {{such as a}} roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt by 1974.|$|E

5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|The first subplot {{involves}} the courtship of Mary Lowther, {{a childhood friend}} of the vicar's wife. Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore is a good man, but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage. In the face of this advice, she does not reject Gilmore outright, but asks for time to consider.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail {{is almost}} always on the move and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E

5|$|While Murray {{prepared}} Emma for publication, Austen began The Elliots, later {{published as}} Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat <b>deeply</b> <b>in</b> the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E
