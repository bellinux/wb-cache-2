500|$|Although [...] "Crazy Boys" [...] has {{two lines}} of lyrics, most of the track is instrumental. Described by a Juke Magazine {{reviewer}} as [...] "free form jazz", it features solos by Brown, Doyle, and Loughnan and heavily-processed guitars, electric saxophone, and vocals. Asked about the group's use of electronics by Eloe Fanouche of RAM, Loughnan answered: [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use them well in order to sound good. We use them to colour the sounds as much as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Weird Al {{also got}} me. He made a video, did a fake {{interview}} with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, {{and put it}} up on the Internet. He's a very funny motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have to sit back and say, [...] "Oh, he got me." [...] It's something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take it.|$|E
500|$|I often {{experience}} combat as {{it should}} be. I see myself {{in the middle of}} a British [...] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E

Royce confessed: [...] "Marshall is the studio right now, laying the most awesome lyrics in the world.

2500|$|Alexis Bledel {{was cast}} in the key role of Rory despite having no {{previous}} acting experience. Sherman-Palladino was drawn to her shyness and innocence, which she said was essential for the character, and felt she photographed well. Lauren Graham was pursued by the casting directors {{from the start of}} the process, but she was committed to another show on NBC. A week before shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham's other show (M.Y.O.B.) would be cancelled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: [...] "Lorelai’s a hard fucking part. You’ve got to be funny, you’ve got to talk really fucking fast, you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> act, you’ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You’ve got to be strong, but not like ‘I hate men,'". Graham and Bledel only met the night before they started filming the pilot.|$|E

Well, {{everything}} IS for the Likes of Us. If we see fit, that is." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{starting}} high school, Judy had to {{move into}} the city, Malta. It was different from what she <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> and she had never seen girls look and behave the way they did. She lived on her own at this point, and <b>got</b> a job <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford clothes and make up to fit in. When the twins started high school, her mother decided to move with them to Malta and they all moved into Judy's grandmother's house, which made Judy's life more isolated.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} given in 1982, Raitt would reveal that [...] "Takin' My Time {{is one of}} my favorite records to listen to, although I started out with Lowell George producing it, and he and I <b>got</b> too close <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have any objectivity about it. That's the problem when you're a woman and you get involved with the people you work with - and I just don't just mean romantically. It becomes too emotional. It's hard to have a strong woman telling the man her ideas when, in fact, the man wants to take over the situation. So that album had a lot of heartache in it. At the time it was a difficult one to make, but now I like it." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 26 December 1799, at 10:15 a.m. Viper {{was seven}} or eight leagues south of the Dodman, serving as escort to a convoy of three {{merchant}} vessels, a sloop, a brig, and a three-masted ship, when she sighted a suspicious vessel sailing towards her. Realising that the approaching vessel was an enemy, Pengelley sailed towards him. The French captain thought that Viper was maneuvering with such timidity that he could prevail. The engagement commenced at 10:45a.m. [...] The close action continued for three-quarters of an hour, when casualties on board the privateer caused {{the majority of the}} crew of the privateer to panic, forcing the captain of the enemy vessel to take flight. A running fight of {{an hour and a half}} ensued as Viper pursued her opponent. Eventually, Viper <b>got</b> close enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pour two broadsides into her enemy, who then struck his colours.|$|R

It was about some girl he said he hadn't been to the theater with. Well, I can't stand a liar. Put everything together--I don't like him; and that settles it.

6000|$|To Jack Burns alone, plain, plodding, and slow, Harold {{showed a}} smiling face. He met {{him with a}} boyish word--"Hello, Jack! how goes it?"--and was eager to talk.

[...] This was one of the morbid fancies jail life had developed; he thought {{everybody}} had turned against him. [...] "Now, I want to tell you something--we're chums, and you mustn't give me away. These fools think I'm going to try to escape, but I ain't. You see, they can't hang me for stabbing that coward, but they'll shut me up for a year or two, and I've got to keep healthy, don't you see? When I get out o' this I strike for the West, don't you see? And I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do a day's work. Look at this arm."
