Crouched upon the ground, {{at the feet of the}} statue, scribe fashion, sat my great-uncle Tanofir, a very aged man with sightless eyes and long hands, so thin that one might see through them against the lamp-flame. His head was shaven, his beard was long and white; white too was his robe. In front of him was a low altar, on which stood a shallow silver vessel filled with pure water, and on either side of it a burning lamp.|$|R
60|$|The {{throng of}} pirates had cleared {{away from the}} great wooden catapult, leaving two of their number to {{discharge}} it.

So for an instant they stood, showing hard and clear against the white sail behind them. The next, redcap had fallen across the stone with an arrow between his ribs; and the other, struck in the leg and in the throat, was writhing and spluttering upon the ground. As he toppled backwards he had loosed the spring, and the huge beam of wood, swinging round with tremendous force, cast the corpse of his comrade so close to the English ship that its mangled and distorted limbs grazed their very stern. As to the stone, it glanced off obliquely and fell midway between the vessels. A roar of cheering and of laughter broke from the rough archers and seamen at the sight, answered by a yell of rage from their pursuers.|$|R
50|$|In March 1943 two new sidings {{were laid}} and the {{headshunt}} lengthened considerably, the down loop was restored {{and a new}} signal box opened in the booking hall, extending out onto the up platform.

Wartime traffic was mainly ammunition and by August 1944 almost all of this had gone to France. The yard was closed and removed in 1950, however the long crossing loop remained in use, particularly for the 1950s holiday traffic. In February 1964 the goods yard closed and was lifted the following year whilst the down loop was finally out of use, and the signalbox closed on 7 November 1965, creating a single section from Halwill to Launceston.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the hour}} before the dawn, just when the night is darkest. We stood in the {{sanctuary}} of the ancient temple of Amon-Ra, that was lit with many lamps. It was an awful place. On either side the great columns towered to the massive roof. At {{the head of the}} sanctuary sat the statue of Amon-Ra, thrice the size of a man. On his brow, rising from the crown, were two tall feathers of stone, and in his hands he held the Scourge of Rule and the symbols of Power and Everlastingness. The lamplight flickered upon his stern and terrible face staring towards the east. To his right was the statue of Mut, the Mother of all things. On her head was the double crown of Egypt and the uræus crest, and in her hand the looped cross, the sign of Life eternal. To his left sat Khonsu, the hawk-headed god of the moon. On his head was the crescent of the young moon carrying the disc of the full moon; in his right hand he also <b>held</b> the <b>looped</b> cross, the sign of Life eternal, and in his left the Staff of Strength.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Look {{introduced}} their Grand Prix heel binding. This was essentially {{one half of}} a Nevada system, turned sideways so it released vertically instead of to the sides.

To fit these different styles of binding points, and the fact that the boots had no standardized size or shape, the rotating portion of the Grand Prix was mounted on a bracket that lifted it above the heel flange, allowing the user to adjust its height. The actual binding point was a bronze roller sized to be similar to a standard cable, this could clip on top of the heel, or would fit into the indentation cut into the heel of some boots.|$|R
40|$|Human {{chorionic}} gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric mol-ecule {{consisting of}} an a-chain {{common to all}} members of the glycoprotein hormone family (luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) non-covalently associated with a b-chain unique to each hormone.

40|$|The HasA(SM) hemophore, {{secreted}} by Serratia marcescens, binds free or hemoprotein bound heme {{with high}} affinity and delivers it {{to a specific}} outer membrane receptor, HasR. In HasA(SM), heme is <b>held</b> by two <b>loops</b> and coordinated to iron by two residues, His 32 and Tyr 75. A third residue His 83 was shown recently to {{play a crucial role}} in heme ligation. To address the mechanistic issues of the heme capture and release processes, the histidine protonation states were studied in both apo- and holo-forms of HasA(SM) in solution. Holo-HasA(SM) was formed with gallium-protoporphyrin IX (GaPPIX), giving rise to a diamagnetic protein. By use of heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy, the imidazole side-chain (15) N and (1) H resonances of the six HasA(SM) histidines were assigned and their pKa values and predominant tautomeric states according to pH were determined. We show that protonation states of the heme pocket histidines can modulate the nucleophilic character of the two axial ligands and, consequently, control the heme binding. In particular, the essential role of the His 83 is emphasized according to its direct interaction with Tyr 75...|$|R

40|$|A heme-acquisition system {{present in}} several Gram-negative {{bacteria}} requires the secretion of hemophores. These extracellular carrier proteins capture heme and deliver it to specific outer membrane receptors. The Serratia marcescens HasA hemophore is a monodomain protein that binds heme {{with a very}} high affinity. Its alpha/beta structure, as that of its binding pocket, has no common features with other iron- or heme-binding proteins. Heme is <b>held</b> by two <b>loops</b> L 1 and L 2 and coordinated to iron by an unusual ligand pair, H 32 /Y 75. Two independent regions of the hemophore beta-sheet are involved in HasA-HasR receptor interaction. Here, we report the 3 -D NMR structure of apoHasA and the backbone dynamics of both loaded and unloaded hemophore. While the overall structure of HasA is very similar in the apo and holo forms, the hemophore presents a transition from an open to a closed form upon ligand binding, through a large movement, of up to 30 A, of loop L 1 bearing H 32. Comparison of loaded and unloaded HasA dynami cs on different time scales reveals striking flexibility changes in the binding pocket. We propose a mechanism by which these structural and dynamic features provide the dual function of heme binding and release to the HasR receptor...|$|R

40|$|Protein p 4 of the Bacillus subtilis phage φ 29 {{switches}} on the transcription of the viral late genes by binding to the viral late promoter at a region close to the RNA polymerase binding site. Gel retardation and DNase I footprinting assays show {{that the presence of}} protein p 4 is required for RNA polymerase recognition of the late promoter. The protein p 4 and RNA polymerase DNA binding sites have been separated by the insertion of bent and non-bent DNA sequences of different lengths. These mutant promoters were used to study in vitro their protein p 4 -dependent transcriptional activity and their interaction with both protein p 4 and RNA polymerase. The results indicate that protein p 4 is able to function at longer DNA distances from the RNA polymerase binding site than in the natural promoter. The extent of protein p 4 activity depended on the length and conformation of the inserted DNA. Activation of transcription and RNA polymerase binding was favoured when the relative orientation of protein p 4 and RNA polymerase was conserved and when the intervening DNA had a bent conformation.

40|$|AIM: To {{postoperative}} {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) failure, {{we describe}} a modified Rendezvous technique for an ERCP in patients operated on for common bile duct stone (CBDS) having a T-tube with retained CBDSs. METHODS: Five cases operated on for CBDSs and having retained stones with a T-tube were referred from other hospitals located in or around Istanbul city to the ERCP unit at the Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital. Under sedation anesthesia, a sterile guide-wire was inserted via the T-tube into the common bile duct (CBD) then to the papilla. A guide-wire was <b>held</b> by a <b>loop</b> snare and removed through the mouth. The guide-wire was inserted into the sphincterotome via the duodenoscope from the tip to the handle. The duodenoscope was inserted down to the duodenum with a sphincterotome and a guide-wire in the working channel. With the guidance of a guide-wire, the ERCP and sphincterotomy were successfully performed, the guide-wire {{was removed from the}} T-tube, the stones were removed and the CBD was reexamined for retained stones by contrast. RESULTS: An ERCP can be used either preoperatively or postoperatively. Although the success rate in an isolated ERCP treatment ranges from up to 87 %- 97 %, 5 %- 10 % of the patients require two or more ERCP treatments. If a secondary ERCP fails, the clinicians must be ready for a laparoscopic or open exploration. A duodenal diverticulum {{is one of the most}} common failures in an ERCP, especially in patients with an intradiverticular papilla. For this small group of patients, an antegrade cannulation via a T-tube can improve the success rate up to nearly 100 %. CONCLUSION: The modified Rendezvous technique is a very easy method and increases the success of postoperative ERCP, especially in patients with large duodenal diverticula and with intradiverticular papilla...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top 1) is a monomeric protein clamp that {{functions}} in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Opposable "lip" domains form a salt bridge to complete Top 1 protein clamping of duplex DNA. Changes in DNA topology are catalyzed by {{the formation of}} a transient phosphotyrosyl linkage between the active-site Tyr- 723 and a single DNA strand. Substantial protein domain movements are required for DNA binding, whereas the tight packing of DNA within the covalent Top 1 -DNA complex necessitates some DNA distortion to allow rotation. To investigate the effects of Top 1 -clamp closure on enzyme catalysis, molecular modeling was used to design a disulfide bond between residues Gly- 365 and Ser- 534, to crosslink protein loops more proximal to the active-site tyrosine than the protein <b>loops</b> <b>held</b> by the Lys- 369 -Glu- 497 salt bridge. In reducing environments, Top 1 -Clamp was catalytically active. However, contrary to crosslinking the salt-bridge loops [Carey, J. F., Schultz, S. J., Sission, L., Fazzio, T. G. & Champoux, J. J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 5640 - 5645], crosslinking the active-site proximal loops inhibited DNA rotation. Apparently, subtle alterations in Top 1 clamp flexibility impact enzyme catalysis in vitro. Yet, the catalytically active Top 1 -Clamp was cytotoxic, even in the reducing environment of yeast cells. Remarkably, a shift in redox potential in glr 1 Delta cells converted the catalytically inactive Top 1 Y 723 F mutant clamp into a cellular toxin, which failed to induce an S-phase terminal phenotype. This cytotoxic mechanism is distinct from that of camptothecin chemotherapeutics, which stabilize covalent Top 1 -DNA complexes, and it suggests that the development of novel therapeutics that promote Top 1 -clamp closure is possible...|$|R
5000|$|The ride {{consists}} of two continuous cable <b>loops,</b> <b>held</b> up by six evenly-dispersed support towers. The cars hang from this moving cable, each one carrying up to four passengers (or 680 pounds). These are open cars with four seats (two rows of two, facing each other). At each station (one at Fantasy Forest, one at Frontier Adventures), a large bullwheel with a pulley-like groove rotates {{the direction in which}} the cable is moving. Incoming cars are transferred from the moving cable to a stationary steel track, along which the wheels of each car glide. As each car enters the station, it is [...] "caught" [...] and brought to a stop by a park employee, who then holds the car in place and opens the door for the passengers to exit. The car is then pushed around {{to the other side of}} the wheel, where another employee steadies the car for new passengers to enter. The door is closed and locked and the car is moved into the launcher. This holds the car in place until the proper launch interval has passed. The rides computer dispatches the cars at an appropriate interval or the employee can pull a cord which allows the car to roll down a ramp (accelerating the car to the same speed as the cable) and automatically clamp onto the cable. 2 safety sensors check to make sure the car is properly clamped onto the cable. If they fail the check the ride automatically shuts down and maintenance checks the latch before restarting the ride.

However, the NS polypeptide of the representative mutant of group E, ts E 1, had a significantly greater electrophoretic mobility than that of the wild-type virus NS polypeptide. The electrophoretic mobilities of the NS polypeptides of the three mutants of complementation group E varied, being greatest in the case of ts E 1, slightly less for ts E 2, and only a little greater than that of wild-type virus NS polypeptide in the case of ts E 3. Since the NS polypeptides of the revertant clones ts E 1 /R 1 and ts E 3 /R 1 have mobilities identical to that of wild-type NS polypeptide, the observed altered mobilities of the group E mutants are almost certainly the direct result of the ts mutations in the E locus. The electrophoretic mobilities of the intracellular NS polypeptides of the group E mutants were indistinguishable from those of their virion NS polypeptides. The electrophoretic mobilities of the NS polypeptides of the group E mutants synthesized in vitro using mRNA synthesized in vitro by TNP were identical to those of the NS polypeptides of their purified virions. The NS polypeptides of all three mutants were labeled with 32 Pi to approximately the same extent as wild-type virus NS polypeptide, indicating that gross differences in phosphorylation of this polypeptide are unlikely to account for the altered mobilities. We propose a model in which the NS polypeptide consists of at least three <b>loops</b> <b>held</b> in this configuration by hydrophobic or ionic forces or both and stabilized by phosphodiester bridges. If a mutation affects one of the amino acids to which the phosphate is covalently linked, the phosphodiester bridge cannot be formed, and, as a result, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate the affected loop opens and thus the NS polypeptide migrates further into the gel. Such a configuration may also explain the multifunctional nature of the NS polypeptide...|$|R
40|$|Existence {{of molten}} {{peridotite}} {{in the early}} history of the Earth has long been the subject of debate and conjecture. Interest in the physical properties stems from a number of sources but was re-focussed {{in the wake of the}} proposal for the existence of a ¸Smagma ocean ¡T in the evolution of the moon, the Earth and other terrestrial planets. The application of phase equilibrium, buoyancy, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic constraints on the behaviour of molten mantle all rely on adequate characterisation ofthe properties of molten peridotite, largely lacking to date. The viscosity in particular, has received too little attention. A big experimental effort has been provided to obtain the dependence on temperature (T) of viscosity at ambient pressure (P) for the natural peridotite collected at Balmuccia, Italy. High-T measurements were performed by using concentric cylinder (CC). The high-T viscometry was started at 1600 _C and proceeded at 10 _C intervals, separated by cooling stages at 5 _C/min, each one held for 1 hour. No measurements were possible below 1570 _C, because crystallization had occurred. All standard attempts to obtain a homogeneous glass failed. A new technique was therefore used. Small 1 - 2 mm chips were hung in Pt loops suspended from a long Pt wire and the loops lowered by hand into the high-T viscosity furnace until the chips fused into a bead of liquid <b>held</b> in the <b>loop</b> by surface tension. These samples were then left to quench and placed aside to be used in the splat-quenching device (SQD) (which allows quench rates on the order of 10 exp 4 _C/s) to finallyobtain a supercooled liquids by squeezing and rapidly quenching a falling liquid drop, through a joint action of a complex photoelectric-driven electromagnetic device. Electron microprobe analysis revealed that only a few vol% of the obtained glasses crystallized in isochemical crystals, whereas the homogeneity of the glassy matrix composition was found to be excellent. As the amount of glass obtained was too small to be used in the micropenetration technique we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to derive the viscosity at low-T. DSC allowed us to unequivocally determine glass transition temperatures (Tg) for cooling/heating rates of 20, 15, 10, 8 and 5 K/min, as the peak of the Cp curves. At this point we used a recent method developed by [1] that, on the basis of the equivalence of the shear stress and the enthalpic relaxation time, allow to predict the low-T viscosity. The combined results obtained by using the different techniques above mentioned were fit by VFT equation with the high-T limiting value (viscosity value at infinite temperature) being fixed at a value of 10 exp- 4. 31 Pas [2]. A comparison between the data obtained here with the recent model from [3] (calibrated with melts as basic as basanite), have shown that in the range 900 to 1600 _C, the viscosity calculated according to [3] is very similar to those measured or calculated by the VFT fit, if A = - 4. 31; the discrepancy becoming significant at T< 900 _C. The very low T dependence of viscosity at superliquidus conditions obtained from the fitting here, indicates that at putative temperatures of the core-mantle boundary, near 5000 _C, the viscosity will decrease up to 10 exp- 3. 5 Pa s.
