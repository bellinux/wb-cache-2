25|$|Produced by Manilow, Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook was {{released}} on September 30, 2003. It {{was the first time}} that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. On December 3, 2003, A aired A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).|$|E
500|$|For the {{performance}} of [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew [...] "Matty Dada" [...] Williams. She had a different vision {{for it in the}} beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [...] it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Rapunzel.'" ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{almost as}} if, as broadcasters, we are glorying his death. The context a show is {{presented}} in will have {{a huge impact on}} how it is received, and it's always been our policy to swim against the tide and resist the policy to conform. It seems ironic—and depressing—to me that after deliberately avoiding the [...] "obvious" [...] approach in my script we are now facing a very [...] "obvious" [...] approach to the scheduling. If Victor dies at Christmas it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a naked push for ratings. The opposite is true: I want Victor's departure to be significant, but stripped of sensationalism.|$|E

They're <b>like</b> little tennis skirts." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{two others}} laughed at him, and mocked him. 'What I when all went so ill with us, {{do you suppose}} that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> succeed? You <b>look</b> <b>like</b> succeeding--you who have never done {{anything}} else but lie and poke about among the ashes!' said they.|$|R
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos. For inspiration, visual effects and design company A52 explored museums, {{read the script}} and researched Roman history. They created the opening sequence entirely in-house. VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we've done and most of what any of us here have seen. There's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series." ...|$|E
500|$|In 40 years, nearly 100 million Sindy dolls {{were sold}} in Britain alone, and in 2003, Sindy was relaunched for her 40th birthday. Her figure was changed to more closely {{resemble}} the girls the doll is marketed towards. Denise Deane, the head of design and development at New Moons, the new Sindy manufacturer, said, [...] "She's lost the big breasts and very long legs, and we've completely changed her face. She's totally unrecognisable. Sindy's still very popular, but she has been neglected {{over the last few}} years, and we don't think people are identifying with that look. She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a 15-year-old, and we've designed her to wear trainers." [...] The doll was released in two versions: six-inch and full-size.|$|E

This would cut another plane {{not through the}} origin in a line (a hypersurface in an n-2 surface), and then the cone in two points (resp. some sort of n-3 conic surface). So it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> probably <b>look</b> <b>like</b> some kind of conic. This is the surface that {{is the image of}} a sphere under g.|$|R
5000|$|Jorge Gutierrez, co-creator of Nickelodeon's El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, {{wanted to}} make the final {{animation}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the concept artwork saying: [...] "I saw every single one that comes out and my biggest heartbreak is that I see all this glorious art, and then the movie doesn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> that! The mandate of this movie was: Our 'Art of' book is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> exactly <b>like</b> the movie. And every artist poured their heart and soul into that idea." [...] Gutierrez did not permit his animation team to go on any research trips to Mexico, feeling that such trips often only covered very touristy aspects of the culture. Instead he had the team address any questions they had about the region to him.|$|R

500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A friend told Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, {{even though there are}} dozens of shots throughout episode 1. That means we did our job well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a man in drag {{for the rest of my}} life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E

Have you taken that letter to Mr. Renault?" [...] He winked at his friend as the old darkey faded into the {{darkness}} of the store, and continued: [...] "Did I ever tell you about Wilson Peale's portrait of my grandmother, Dorothy Carvel, that I saw this summer at my brother Daniel's, in Pennsylvania? Jinny's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> something <b>like</b> her, sir. Um! She was a fine woman. Black hair, though. Jinny's is brown, like her Ma's." [...] The Colonel handed a cigar to Captain Brent, and lit one himself. [...] "Daniel has a book my grandfather wrote, mostly about her. Lord, I remember her! She was the queen-bee of the family while she lived. I wish some of us had her spirit." ...|$|R
5000|$|In this episode, {{the girls}} {{learn how to}} be {{versatile}} in the clothes they wear. The girls have a one-on-one session with Joey Mead at the Salabianca learning how to create different attires using different types of clothes. Joey Mead asked the girls to pair up and create an attire for their respective partners. Bambi and Joy were paired together but found that both of them were difficulty due to tension brewing between them. Joy even joked that she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make Bambi <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "mangkukulam" [...] or witch.|$|R
2500|$|Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen {{friendship}} as {{the reason}} for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. [...] "It makes them easier. Jake is a good friend. I know he's got my back and is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make me <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an ass onscreen. I hope I return the favor," [...] said Hansis. [...] "I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable." [...] Silbermann added, [...] "I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, I think it makes it more comfortable." ...|$|R
500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We have to think about costume and what it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you have to think of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: [...] "It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us {{and a lot of other}} people." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{confirming}} that Klein was directing her video, Gaga {{explained that she}} [...] "doesn't know what [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> until it's finished", and commented that [...] " [...] {{a very good friend}} of mine and I love him so much, [...] I have so much respect for him. And we've been excited to collaborate and have a fashion photographer tell us a story, the story of my music through his lens and this idea of fashion and lifestyle." [...] Gaga explained that Klein understood her [...] "I am what I wear" [...] lifestyle, making him a suitable director for the video. She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for the love of my gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Roth {{appeared}} on the TV series The Sopranos as a poker-playing guest of Tony Soprano.

5000|$|According to a {{study by}} Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was {{probably}} much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is [...] "extremely public", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: [...] "What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying <b>to</b> say 'We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make this <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Russia'." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009 and the financial crisis of 2007–2010. When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies [...] "ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes {{the rest of us}} have to put on a show," [...] a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs en route to a November 19 congressional hearing. The dilemma over bailout money also bears resemblance to federal bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler. In describing how he plans to destroy Jack's image, Devon says [...] "by the time I'm done you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make AIG <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the Lehman Brothers of microwaves," [...] a reference to two notable corporations from the financial crisis.

40|$|Scientist-entrepreneurs {{prominent}} in biotech and other high-technology industries view going public {{not as a}} cost-effective source of capital but as a cross between selling a now-proven innovation and winning a lottery. Unlike most empirical IPO analyses confined to those firms that go public, we study substantially all the non-public biotech firms founded up through 1989. The probability {{that one of these}} firms goes public in any given year increases with the quality of the firm's science base (use of recombinant DNA technology, number of articles by star scientists as or with firm employees, number of biotech patents), the percentage of eligible firms going public the year the firm was founded as a strategy indicator, recent biotech returns as an indicator of a hot market, and whether or how many rounds of venture capital has been obtained. The same key factors increase the expected proceeds raised from IPOs, but the quality of the firm's science base plays a more dominant role. All firms <b>going</b> public try <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the next Genentech, but only those with the strong science base necessary for success attract large investments. ...|$|R

2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to see how she is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> this when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
