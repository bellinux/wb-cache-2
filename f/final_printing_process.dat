40|$|The {{scale-up}} of {{microcontact printing}} (μCP) to a roll-to-roll technique for large-scale surface patterning requires scalable tooling for continuous pattern printing with μm-scale features (e. g., 1 – 50 [*]μm). Here, {{we examine the}} process of creating such a tool using an optical direct-write or “maskless” method working on a rotating cylindrical substrate. A predictive model of pattern formation is presented along with experimental results to examine the key control factors for this process. It is shown that factors can be modulated to vary the cross-sectional shape in addition to feature height and width. This feature can then be exploited to improve the robustness of the <b>final</b> <b>printing</b> <b>process.</b> Center for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT and KFUP...|$|E
40|$|Of the readily {{available}} piezoelectric engineering materials perovskite phase {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) has the strongest mechanical to electrical coupling. PZT based devices {{have the potential to}} have the highest performance. Due to the strong piezoelectric response and low operating voltage, many groups have worked to integrate thin film PZT into a wide range of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices including: actuators, energy harvesters, resonators, pressure sensors, pumps, nano-positioning stages, and MEMS switches. However, processing of thin film PZT is not readily compatible with existing MEMS fabrication processes and significant design constraints exist when integrating thin film PZT. In recent years drop-on-demand (DOD) printing has been studied as a robust, flexible, and inexpensive method of material deposition for MEMS. Direct printing enables the designer to deposit a film based on a digital pattern file only eliminating the need for photolithography and subsequent etching steps in the manufacturing process flow. There is a significant cost savings due to a reduction in the material consumption during manufacturing and in chemical waste produced. The result is a manufacturing process that is cleaner and cheaper than other common deposition techniques. The most compelling benefit of direct printing of PZT is that it provides a freedom of geometry that eliminates many of the design constraints currently associated with PZT MEMS. Since high quality thin films can be achieved with deposition control that is not possible with spin coating, novel functionalities can be incorporated into PZT MEMS. Specifically, PZT printing is able to deposit material over and around large out-of-plane features. In addition, the thickness of thin film PZT can vary deterministically across a device or across a wafer. A new manufacturing method for the deposition of PZT thin films based on ink jet printing has been developed and used to fabricate a piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer. A solvent system and processes parameters were established that enable the deposition of high quality PZT thin films. Substrate temperature and drop spacing for uniform deposition were determined and both multilayer and single layer PZT films were successfully deposited. Alignment within 10 [mu]m and a resolution limit of 30 [mu]m were demonstrated. The performance of a printed PZT based ultrasonic transducer was fit to established models to determine piezoelectric coupling and dielectric properties. The piezoelectric coupling coefficient, d₃₁, for printed PZT was between - 75 pC/N and - 95 pC/N. Impedance data at 1 kHz provided the relative permittivity (750 - 890) and the dielectric loss tangent (2. 4 %- 2. 8 %). The <b>final</b> <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> enabled the first digital deposition of thin film PZT and the printed PZT based pMUT confirmed the properties of the film are within the range required for a high performance piezoelectric MEMS devices. by Stephen P.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effect of {{low-temperature}} plasma (LTP) on an ink-jet-printed cotton fabric. Owing to the specific printing and conductivity requirements for ink-jet printing, none of the conventional printing chemicals used for cotton fabric can be directly incorporated into the ink formulation. As a result, the cotton fabric requires pretreatment with the printing chemicals prior to the stage of ink-jet printing. The aim {{of this article is}} to study the possibility and effectiveness of applying LTP treatment to enhance the performance of pretreatment paste containing sodium alginate so as to improve the properties of the ink-jet-printed cotton fabric. Scanning electron microscopic pictures show that LTP treatment may cause cracks on the fiber surface and hence more dyes could approach the fiber surface during the ink-jet <b>printing</b> <b>process,</b> leading to a higher dye uptake subsequently. In addition, not only the dye uptake is increased after the LTP treatment but the color-fastness properties and the definition of the <b>final</b> <b>print</b> marks are also improved. Therefore, LTP pretreatment in couple with the ink-jet printing technique could improve the <b>final</b> <b>printed</b> properties of cotton fabric. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{printing}} excellent quality images has increased tremendously in {{parallel to the}} growth spurts in the digital camera market. Printing good quality images consistently, however, remains a difficult and/or expensive venture despite the numerous advances in color technology and printing. To alleviate these issues, a color compensating software solution was developed to utilize the unique Kikuze calibration chart to improve printer output. The software solution integrates with the windows <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> at the operating system level through a UNIDRV plug-in.
