5|$|Since its publication, {{some have}} viewed {{the book with}} skepticism. Some in the Middle Ages {{regarded}} the book simply as a romance or fable, due largely to the sharp difference of its descriptions of a sophisticated civilisation in China to other early accounts by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and William of Rubruck who portrayed the Mongols as 'barbarians' who appeared to belong to 'some other world'. Doubts have also been raised in later centuries about Marco Polo's narrative of his travels in China, for example for his failure to mention the Great Wall of China, {{and in particular the}} difficulties in identifying many of the place names he used (the great majority however have since been identified). Many have questioned <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had visited the places he mentioned in his itinerary, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had appropriated the accounts of his father and uncle or other travelers, and some doubted <b>if</b> <b>he</b> even reached China, or that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, perhaps never went beyond Khanbaliq (Beijing).|$|E
