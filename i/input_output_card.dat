25|$|A SDIO (Secure Digital <b>Input</b> <b>Output)</b> <b>card</b> is an {{extension}} of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, barcode readers, FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras, and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and IrDA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{control is}} an {{approach}} to evaluate process system with real-time parameters by controlling selected variables to accomplish the control objectives. Real-time issues such as rapid testing, nonlinearity and computational problem have led researchers {{in recent years to}} do intensive work on development methodologies to enhance control in real-time. Selection of control approaches has also been reviewed to adapt with these real-time issues apart from other strategies. In this research, a predictive algorithm namely Generalized Predictive Control will be evaluated in real-time by applying LabVIEW software as tools for algorithm implementation. LabVIEW is chosen because of its block diagram implementation with simple graphical user interface approach to execute algorithm in real-time faster. Hence, it is essential for complex algorithm to control real-time process system. Coupled-tanks have been identified as process models that are inherently nonlinear and hard to control due to unavailability of the exact modelsâ€™ descriptions. As for this, real time control will be applied to the coupled tank as the test bed for level control process. Experimental evaluation and comparison of the predictive algorithm performance will be benchmarked against PID control. PC and analogue <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>card</b> will be used as the controller and also for data acquisition and realtime data display...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} controlling a Brushless DC Motor (BLDCM) using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) instead of micro-controllers chips. As PLCs are now involved in most industrial processes, therefore, developing a program to handle the control of BLDCMs will save electronic components used in the drive circuit. Further, one PLC may control more than one motor via programming extra <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs</b> already implemented in the PLC or simply by attaching additional <b>input</b> / <b>output</b> <b>cards.</b> The speed is varied through the PWM technique. The PLC performed well with speeds up to 1550 rpm. The motor did not run faster due to the switching delay (scanning cycle time and hardware) of the PLC...|$|R

40|$|Remotely sensed data, {{recorded}} {{by means of}} the MIVIS hyperspectral scanner in the framework of the research activity of the CNR Institutes IIA-LARA and IMAA, have been calibrated to reflectance values and then quantitatively compared with ground data. A new procedure for radiometric calibration has been defined by utilizing the MIVIS test-bench and applying a wider radiance range with respect to the one provided by the manufacturing company. New calibration curves have been determined and applied in the pre-processing chain. For validation purpose ground spectra were measured during the campaign by means of a portable spectroradiometer. The atmospheric correction has been carried out by implementing an IDL procedure to manage MODTRAN 4 <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>cards.</b> MIVIS test data acquired over Passo Corese (Roma) have shown how the new calibration coefficients significantly improve the radiometric accuracy. In particular, in the VIS spectral region the percentage error, with respect to a ground truth spectrum, is about half of that occurring if the standard calibration coefficients are used...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{internally}} buffered crossbar (IBC) switching architecture where the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> distributed schedulers are embedded inside the crossbar fabric chip. As opposed to previous designs, where these schedulers are spread across <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> line <b>cards,</b> our design allows the schedulers to have cheap and fast {{access to the}} internal buffers, optimizes the flow control mechanism and makes the IBC more scalable. We employed the Xilinx Virtex- 4 FX platform to show the feasibility of our proposal and implemented a reconfigurable hardware based IBC switch with the maximum port count that we could fit on a single chip.

40|$|We present {{progressive}} {{work that}} is based on our recently developed rapid control prototyping system (RCP), designed for the implementation of high-performance adaptive optical control algorithms using a continuous deformable mirror (DM). The RCP system, presented in 2014, is resorting to a Xilinx Kintex- 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), placed on a self-developed PCIe card, and installed on a high-performance computer that runs a hard real-time Linux operating system. For this purpose, algorithms for the efficient evaluation of data from a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) on an FPGA have been developed. The corresponding analog <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>cards</b> are designed for exploiting the maximum possible performance while not being constrained to a specific DM and control algorithm due to the RCP approach. In this second part of our contribution, we focus on recent results that we achieved with this novel experimental setup. By presenting results which are far superior to the former ones, we further justify the deployment of the RCP system and its required time and resources. We conducted various experiments for revealing the effective performance, i. e. the maximum manageable complexity in the controller design that may be achieved in realtime without performance losses. A detailed analysis of the hidden latencies is carried out, showing that these latencies have been drastically reduced. In addition, a series of concepts relating the evaluation of the wavefront as well as designing and synthesizing a wavefront are thoroughly investigated with the goal to overcome some of the prevalent limitations. Furthermore, principal results regarding the closed-loop performance of the low-speed dynamics of the integrated heater in a DM concept are illustrated in detail; to be combined with the piezo-electric high-speed actuators in the next step...|$|R
