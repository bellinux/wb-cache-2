5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October16 and then to hurricane status on October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. <b>For</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour, and the water stop at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterházy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Australians were {{detected}} while waiting to step off and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost {{all of their}} officers, lost their formation {{and had to be}} re-organised before the attack on {{the eastern side of the}} village could continue. The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east. At the same time, on the right, the right-most company had advanced to the Doignes–Hermies road when they had begun to take fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear just before dawn. The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine-gun positioned near a sandpit on the other side of a road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|An ominous sign {{of things}} to come {{occurred}} on the afternoon of 8 February, when Melbourne was enveloped by a giant dust storm. The dust cloud was over 300 metres high and 500 kilometres long and was composed of an estimated 50,000 tonnes of topsoil from the drought-ravaged Wimmera and Mallee areas of north-west Victoria. Leading a dry cool change and preceded by record temperatures, the dust storm cut visibility in Melbourne to 100 metres, creating near darkness <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour.|$|E
25|$|From June 2001, NSB {{introduced}} additional rush-hour trains between Trondheim and Steinkjer, {{giving a}} half-hour headway. NSB introduced their Class 93 locomotives in 2001: starting on 7 January {{they were used}} on the Salten Commuter Rail, which ran a higher frequency of departures between Rognan and Bodø. This service has become a success. This {{was not the case}} when the same trains were put in as replacements on the intercity trains. Although allowing <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour faster travel, they had fewer amenities and little space. Passengers protested, and after trials from 2003, Di 4s with carriages were reintroduced during the summers from 2003 and all year from 2007. From 2006 the sleeper services were cut from Mosjøen and Mo i Rana.|$|E
25|$|After {{blowing the}} tire on turn one, Mulford had to limp {{around the track}} <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> entire lap, and {{subsequently}} bent the rim. That necessitated an even longer pit stop at that juncture to hammer out the damage. The accounts from the newspapers claim that Harroun changed only four tires all day during only three pit stops. Harroun's team changed the right rear tire three times, and one other unspecified tire. Harroun's shorter elapsed time in the pits is alone considered sufficient to more than overcome any track position advantage Mulford might have been thought to have. But the undermining evidence to support Harroun as the rightful winner was the team strategy to run a constant 75mph pace, regardless of position, {{in order to save}} tire wear. During the 1910 Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race, as well as during test runs in May 1911, Harroun discovered that by merely running a constant 75 mph pace instead of an 80 mph (or faster) pace, he would substantially reduce his tire wear and increase tire life.|$|E

25|$|On Memorial Day, 2011, 53-year-old Raymond Zack, of Alameda, California, {{walked into}} the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly 150 yards {{offshore}} <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour. His foster mother, Dolores Berry, called 9-1-1 {{and said that he}} was trying to drown himself. (There are conflicting reports about Zack's intentions.) Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water. The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene. According to police reports, Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water. Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue. Dozens of civilians on the beach, and watching from their homes across from the beach, did not enter the water, apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue. Eventually, Zack collapsed in the water, apparently from hypothermia. Even then, nobody entered the water for several minutes. Finally, a good samaritan entered the water and pulled Zack to shore. Zack died afterwards at a local hospital.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May, Macaroni was a 10/1 {{chance for}} the Derby at Epsom, with Lord Clifden {{starting}} the 4/1 favourite {{in a field of}} thirty-one. The race was run in difficult conditions with heavy rain and soft ground. Among the spectators was the Prince of Wales, who became the first member of the British Royal Family to attend the race since Prince Albert in 1840. The start of the race was delayed <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour, owing to a record thirty-two false starts caused by horses breaking away or failing to line up correctly. The huge field led to good deal of bumping and roughness, with three horses either falling or being brought down. Chaloner held up Macaroni in the early stages, before moving into fifth place entering the straight. A furlong from the finish, Lord Clifden went into a clear lead and looked the likely winner, but Macaroni produced a strong late run to catch the favourite in the last strides and win by a head. Rapid Rhone finished well to take third place. Macaroni's victory was warmly received in Newmarket, where the church bells were rung in celebration. Naylor marked his success by donating £1,000 to charities in his native city of Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December 1971, the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) detonated a {{time bomb}} {{at the door of}} McGurk's public house in Belfast. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The {{explosion}} caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles. The book Killing For Britain (2009), written by former UVF member 'John Black', claims that the MRF organized the bombing and helped the bombers {{get in and out of}} the area. Two days before the bombing, republican prisoners had escaped from nearby Crumlin Road Prison. Security was tightened, and there were many checkpoints in the area at the time. However, locals claimed that the security forces helped the bombers by removing the checkpoints an hour before the attack. One of the bombers—Robert Campbell—said that their original target had been The Gem, a nearby pub that was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. It is claimed the MRF plan was to help the UVF bomb The Gem, and then blame the bombing on the Provisional IRA. This would start a feud between the two IRA factions, diverting them from their fight against the security forces and draining their support. Campbell said that The Gem had security outside and, after waiting <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour, they decided to bomb the nearest 'Catholic pub' instead. Immediately afterward, the security forces claimed that a bomb had accidentally exploded while being handled by IRA members inside McGurk's.|$|E

500|$|As part of South Australia's sesquicentenary, the South Australia Jubilee 150 board granted $250,000 {{for work}} on the fort, {{allowing}} construction of a visitor centre. Queen Elizabeth II visited and inspected the site, and newly constructed visitor centre, <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> hour on 13 March 1986. For the visit the historical association demonstrated firing of both the 64 and 2 pounder cannons. The visitor centre was officially opened one month after this visit. Governor Dame Roma Mitchell named the old road [...] "Queen Elizabeth II Walk" [...] in a March 1991 ceremony, commemorating the 5th anniversary of the queen's visit. Considerable subsequent restoration work has been completed on the fort, including the barrack's interior.

500|$|Filming for City Lights officially {{began on}} December 27, 1928, after Chaplin and Carr {{had worked on}} the script <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> entire year. As a filmmaker, Chaplin was known for being a perfectionist; he was noted for doing many more [...] "takes" [...] than other {{directors}} at the time. Production began with the first scene at the flower stand where the Little Tramp first meets the Blind Flower Girl. The scene took weeks to shoot, and Chaplin first began to have second thoughts about casting Cherrill. Years later, Cherrill said, [...] "I never liked Charlie and he never liked me." [...] In his autobiography, Chaplin took responsibility for his on-set tensions with Cherrill, blaming the stress of making the film for the conflict. Filming the scene continued until February 1929 and again for ten days in early April before Chaplin put the scene aside to be filmed later. He then shot the opening scene of the Little Tramp waking up in a newly unveiled public statue. This scene involved up to 380 extras and was especially stressful for Chaplin to shoot. During this part of shooting, construction was being done at Chaplin Studios because the city of Los Angeles had decided to widen La Brea Avenue and Chaplin was forced to move several buildings away from the road.|$|E
500|$|In {{the episodes}} prior to [...] "Beyond the Sea", the protagonists of The X-Files are firmly {{established}} in the roles of believer (Mulder) and rational scientist/skeptic (Scully). [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] is the first episode in which these roles are reversed. Scully, vulnerable {{after the death of}} her father, is persuaded by Boggs' apparent psychic ability. Meanwhile, Mulder refuses to believe the serial killer, discounts any evidence in Boggs' favor and will only consider rational explanations. According to Jan Delsara, Scully is inclined to believe Boggs because she identifies with him: they both understand the pressure of high family expectations. Scully strongly desired to make her father proud, despite not fulfilling his expectation that she became a doctor, and Boggs, in killing his family, had hoped to kill their expectations and judgment of him. In contrast, Mulder's relationship with his parents, based on resentment of them for their failure to protect his sister (themes developed later in the series), makes him unwilling to identify with Boggs. While Scully follows her instinct and solves the case, Mulder gets shot and ends up in the hospital because of his doubts and skepticism. According to Joe Bellon, as the episode progresses, even Scully's personality becomes like Mulder's and [...] "for all narrative purposes, she becames Mulder <b>for</b> <b>almost</b> <b>an</b> entire episode." [...] According to Dean A. Kowalski, this role reversal of the partners represents a [...] "blending" [...] of Mulder and Scully's characters that is present throughout the series.|$|E
