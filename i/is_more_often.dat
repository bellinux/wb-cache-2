5|$|Lutetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, {{but not in}} moist air. Lutetium is the last element in the lanthanide series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths. Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> considered as such.|$|E
5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E

5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> {{found in}} drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It {{became much more}} common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E
5|$|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E

5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of mendelevium are known, {{with mass}} numbers from 245 to 260; all are radioactive. Additionally, five nuclear isomers are known: 245mMd, 247mMd, 249mMd, 254mMd, and 258mMd. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 258Md with a half-life of 51.5days, and the longest-lived isomer is 258mMd with a half-life of 58.0minutes. Nevertheless, the slightly shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> used in chemical experimentation {{because it can}} be produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium. After 258Md, the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, 257Md with a half-life of 5.52hours, 259Md with a half-life of 1.60hours, and 256Md with a half-life of 1.17hours. All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half-lives that are less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5minutes.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus peregrinator, {{described}} by Sundevall in 1837, {{is known as}} the Indian peregrine falcon, Shaheen falcon, Indian shaheen or shaheen falcon. It was formerly sometimes known as Falco atriceps or Falco shaheen. Its range includes South Asia from Pakistan across India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Southeastern China. In India, the shaheen is reported from all states except Uttar Pradesh, mainly from rocky and hilly regions. The Shaheen is also reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs, with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest. In India, apart from nesting on cliffs, it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers. A population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in Sri Lanka was made in 1996. It is non-migratory, and is small and dark, with rufous underparts. In Sri Lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> seen along the coast.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of nobelium are known, {{with mass}} numbers 250–260 and 262; all are radioactive. Additionally, nuclear isomers {{are known for}} mass numbers 251, 253, and 254. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 259No with a half-life of 58minutes, and the longest-lived isomer is 251mNo with a half-life of 1.7seconds. However, the still undiscovered isotope 261No is predicted to have a still longer half-life of 170min. Additionally, the shorter-lived 255No (half-life 3.1minutes) <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> used in chemical experimentation {{because it can be}} produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium-249 with carbon-12 ions. After 259No and 255No, the next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253No (half-life 1.62minutes), 254No (51seconds), 257No (25seconds), 256No (2.91seconds), and 252No (2.57seconds). All of the remaining nobelium isotopes have half-lives that are less than a second, and the shortest-lived known nobelium isotope (250No) has a half-life of only 0.25milliseconds. The isotope 254No is especially interesting theoretically {{as it is in the}} middle of a series of prolate nuclei from 231Pa to 279Rg, and the formation of its nuclear isomers (of which two are known) is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2f5/2 which come just above the spherical proton shell; it can be synthesized in the reaction of 208Pb with 48Ca.|$|E
