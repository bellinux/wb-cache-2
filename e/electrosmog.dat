40|$|<b>Electrosmog</b> is the {{electromagnetic}} radiation emitted from wireless technology such as Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular towers, and poses potential hazard to human. <b>Electrosmog</b> is invisible, and {{we rely on}} detectors which show level of <b>electrosmog</b> in a abstract warning such as numbers. Our system is able to detect <b>electrosmog</b> level from number of Wi-Fi networks, connected cellular towers and strengths, and show in an intuitive representation by blurring {{the vision of the}} users wearing a Head- Mounted Display (HMD). The HMD displays in real-time the users’ augmented surrounding environment with blurriness, as though the <b>electrosmog</b> actually clouds the environment. For demonstration, participants can walk in a video-see-through HMD and observe vision gradually blurred while approaching our prepared dense wireless network...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impacts of <b>electrosmog,</b> noise and air {{pollution}} on the dwellings’ rents in the cities of Zurich and Lugano. The hedonic price regressions are estimated using a large micro-level data set and {{taking into account the}} spatial correlation in unobserved factors. The results suggest that the presence of mobile phone antenna has a negative impact on the rent, but this effect is not statistically significant in Lugano. In addition, PM 10 density and the level of noise at night have a significant negative impact on the rent. Accounting for spatial correlation has little effect on the coefficient estimates. hedonic pricing, <b>electrosmog,</b> noise, air pollution...|$|E
40|$|Traffic noise, air {{pollution}} and electromagnetic pollution (i. e. non-ionizing radiation, also called <b>electrosmog)</b> are typical negative local externalities in urban areas. They are side-effects of human and economic activity (e. g. road transport, telecommunication) and they affect individuals’ well-being negatively without compensation. In recent years, the increased number of mobile phone antennas in residential areas, and thus the increased intensity of radiated power, has aroused public concern, discussions and protests. The view of an antenna is annoying {{an increasing number of}} inhabitants. In this paper, the stated Choice Experiment (CE) is used to estimate the Willingness To Pay (WTP) residents in the cities of Zurich and Lugano place on the reduction of these three environmental loads. Estimation results reveal that there is a positive and significant WTP for a reduction of {{air pollution}} and traffic noise levels to those limit values fixed by the government. Respondents also show WTP for reducing <b>electrosmog</b> and removing mobile phone antennas from their view, however to a lesser extent.

40|$|Noise, air {{pollution}} and electromagnetic pollution (i. e. non-ionizing radiation, also called <b>electrosmog)</b> are typical negative local externalities in urban areas. They are side-effects of human and economic activity (e. g. road transport, telecommunication) and affect individuals’ well-being negatively without compensation. Measurements carried out in 2005 and 2006 show that in several Swiss cities the limit values of {{air pollution}} fixed in the Swiss law have often been exceeded. Moreover, in several areas of these cities also {{the day and night}} standards for the noise level were violated. Further, the increased number of mobile phone antennas in residential areas, and thus the increased intensity of radiated power, has, in recent years, aroused public concern, discussions and protests. The view of an antenna is annoying an increasing number of inhabitants. In order to solve these problems, policy-makers have to introduce new environmental instruments {{to improve the quality of}} the environment in the Swiss cities. This paper aims at giving policy-makers information on benefits generated by an improvement of local environmental quality. In two Swiss cities (Lugano and Zurich), stated choice experiment is used to estimate the benefits of a reduction of the level of the negative externalities mentioned above. Results from this choice experiment reveal that there is a positive and significant willingness to pay (WTP) for a reduction of the level of {{air pollution and}} noise to those limit values fixed by the government. In addition, this is the first study that uses a stated preference approach based on a choice experiment for the estimation of the benefit of a reduction of <b>electrosmog.</b> choice experiment, <b>electrosmog,</b> noise, air pollution...|$|E

Although the <b>electrosmog</b> being unsmelt and unfelt, its potential harm {{over long periods of}} exposure could be realized on plants in the manifestation of morphological and biochemical disorders. Such kind of manifestations when aimed at Oxalis corniculata at various distances from cell tower positively indicated in its stomatal patterning. Increased stomatal density and stomatal index at certain distances followed by a sharp fall in values compels to think that this invisible threat has become a new environmental challenge.

40|$|The health {{implication}} {{associated with}} exposure from telecommunication masts is demanding attention {{due to the}} expansion of networks and base station installation. This study measures the power density from various telecommunication masts of the different network providers using a radiofrequency meter, an <b>Electrosmog</b> from LESSEMF, USA at a radial distance of 360 m around some selected areas in Delta State. The readings obtained ranges from 0. 03 µW/m- 2 to 5. 66 µW/m- 2. Comparing the result with the recommended international maximum permissible exposure limit of 10 7 µW/m 2 reveals that the exposure levels in these areas are low and as such not able to produce significant health risks among the people of these areas...|$|E
40|$|While {{the radio}} {{spectrum}} allocation is well regulated, {{there is little}} knowledge about its actual utilization over time and space. This limitation hinders taking effective actions in various applications including cognitive radios, <b>electrosmog</b> monitoring, and law enforcement. We introduce Electrosense, an initiative that seeks a more efficient, safe and reliable monitoring of the electromagnetic space by improving the accessibility of spectrum data for the general public. A collaborative spectrum monitoring network is designed that monitors the spectrum at large scale with low-cost spectrum sensing nodes. The large set of data is stored and processed in a big data architecture and provided {{back to the community}} with an open spectrum data as a service model, that allows users to build diverse and novel applications with different requirements. We illustrate useful usage scenarios of the Electrosense data. Comment: Under revie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{participatory}} sensing paradigm, {{through the}} growing availability of cheap sensors in mobile devices, enables applications of great social and business interest, e. g., <b>electrosmog</b> exposure measurement and early earthquake detection. However, users ’ privacy concerns regarding their activity traces {{need to be}} adequately addressed as well. The existing static privacy-enabling approaches, which hide or obfuscate data, offer some protection {{at the expense of}} data value. These approaches do not offer privacy guarantees and heterogeneous user privacy requirements cannot be met by them. In this paper, we propose a user-side privacy-protection scheme; it adaptively adjusts its parameters, in order to meet personalized location-privacy protection requirements against adversaries in a measurable manner. As proved by simulation experiments with artificial- and real-data traces, when feasible, our approach not only always satisfies personal location-privacy concerns, but also maximizes data utility (in terms of error, data availability, area coverage), as compared to static privacy-protection schemes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{occupational}} exposure due to RF radiation leaks inside {{the base station}} cabin, when working on the Base station Transceiver (BTS) Radios and TX cables and during active radio communication was measured. A total of number 30 base stations Cabins were studied {{in the eastern part}} of Nigeria, using a Broad band TES- 90 <b>Electrosmog</b> meter. The maximum instantaneous electric field strength obtained from GSM 1800 radio was 3. 72 V/m, 16. 56 V/m for GSM 900 radio and 11. 29 V/m for the Tx cables. The maximum instantaneous indoor and out power density were 35. 47 mW/m 2 and 6. 64 mW/m 2 respectively. Also, the average values of the obtained electric field strength from all the cabins are 1. 18 ± 1. 07 V/m from GSM 1800 radio, 2. 33 ± 3. 82 V/m from GSM 900 radio and 1. 77 ± 2. 20 V/m from the Tx cables. The result of this study shows that the values were less than ICNIRP limits for {{occupational exposure}}...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{pollution}} (i. e. non-ionizing radiation, {{also called}} <b>electrosmog),</b> noise {{and air pollution}} are typical negative local externalities in urban areas. The negative impact of these externalities can {{be reflected in the}} lower price of dwellings located in polluted and/or noisy areas or in the vicinity of sources of electromagnetic pollution. In order to examine the impact of these externalities on the price of properties, we have estimated a hedonic price function using revealed data for the cities of Zurich and Lugano. The novelty {{of this paper is to}} consider a variable on the level of electromagnetic pollution in the hedonic model. The data set used for the hedonic regression comprises a representative sample of more than 6 ’ 800 flats. The main findings show a significant negative impact of air pollution, noise and electromagnetic radiation on the rents of flats. The impact of 1 dB(A) above the night critical value (50 dB(A)) decreases rents in the city of Zurich by 0. 3 % on average and the increase of PM 10 by 1 µg/m 3 decreases the rent in both cities by around 2 %. Generally, it could be observed that the impact of PM 10 is stronger in Lugano than in Zurich. This could be explained by the level of air pollution i...|$|E
