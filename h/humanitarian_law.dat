5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international <b>humanitarian</b> <b>law</b> concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
