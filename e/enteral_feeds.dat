40|$|<b>Enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is {{commonly}} used in paedaitric patients. It helps to improve the digestive, absorptive, immunologic and nutrition status. However, poor handling in <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> can lead to bacterial contaminations and severe consequences resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. At present, there are no definite guidelines on the handling of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in local setting, therefore developing evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is critically important to eliminate inconsistent practices and prevent nosocomial infections related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> This dissertation is a translational nursing research that aims at developing evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants. The objectives of this thesis are to search for existing literatures on enteral feeding; perform a critical appraisal on the literatures; develop guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants; assess the implementation potential of the proposed guidelines, and develop the implementation and evaluation plans. The {{ultimate goal is to}} reduce the nosocomial infections in infants with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in an acute hospital. A systemic search for relevant and valid evidence was performed using three electronic databases and nine relevant studies were retrieved. Critical appraisals on the nine studies were performed and the level of evidence for each study was graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). By synthesizing the data from nine studies, it is concluded that optimal hang time and proper hand hygiene appeared to have significant effect in reducing nosocomial infections related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> The implementation potential of the innovation was assessed in terms of the transferability, feasibility and cost benefit ratio. After assessing the implementation potential, it is found that the evidence is transferable and feasible to implement the proposed guideline in the target paeditaric setting. An evidence based guideline on <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in infants was developed. An implementation plan of the new guideline included a comprehensive communication plan with both administration and nurses and a pilot test were developed to ensure a smooth implementation and optimize the transferability and effectiveness of the evidence based guideline in the target population.

Appropriate <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> {{is the most important}} factor associated with the prevention of VAP. However, the standardization of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> methods needs clarification. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the factors associated with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in order to prevent VAP and to describe the characteristics of these factors. A comprehensive search was undertaken involving all major databases from their inception to September 2008 using medical subject heading terms associated with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in relation to VAP. The overall reference list of identified studies was audited, and eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after (pre–post) studies and meta-analyses. To generate the characteristics of the factors associated with VAP, the reported components of these trials were pinpointed and categorized. A total of 14 papers were found that had investigated the factors linking <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> and VAP. For these, 11 were randomized controlled trials, 1 was a meta-analysis and 2 were case-controlled analyses. Twelve of these 14 studies were conducted at a single institute and 2 were conducted at multiple institutes. The sample sizes varied from 10 to 2, 528 subjects. Three major issues were identified based on the purpose of study interventions, and these were the effects of feeding method (continuous vs. intermittent), feeding site on aspiration (gastric vs. small bowel), and the timing of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (early vs. late). The evidence suggests that a correct choice of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> method can effectively reduce complications due to aspiration. Furthermore, intermittent <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> and with a small residual volume feed can reduce gastroesophageal reflux, and increased total intake volume and early feeding can reduce ICU mortality.

All in the FEG group developed marked abdominal distension, large, bile stained, nasogastric aspirates, and constipation requiring rectal washouts.

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the adequacy of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding,</b> and the reason and prevalence of under-nutrition, and to determine the relationships between caloric intake and resulting nutritional parameters among neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. MethodsThe participants for this descriptive study were 47 neurosurgical ICU patients who had <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> initiated after ICU admission. Data were collected from the initial day of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> for 7 days. Data related to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding,</b> feeding interruptions or delay, prealbumin, and transferrin were collected. ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 56. 62 years. Twenty-six patients did not receive their feeding formula more than once during 7 days, and 11 had interruptions more than 6 times. The mean number of feeding interruptions was 3. 23 (SD = 4. 47). On the average, only 76. 44 % of the estimated energy requirement was provided by <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> to the patients. The frequency of underfeeding was 52. 17 % with respect to <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding.</b> The most frequent reason for the feeding interruption was observation before and after intubation and extubation, which was unavoidable. The next most common reason was gastrointestinal bleeding, mostly due to old clots or trace, followed by residual volume less than 100 mL.
