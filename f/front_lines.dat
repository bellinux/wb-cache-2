This study investigated the work of <b>front</b> <b>line</b> staff and their perceptions of the impact of a changing policy landscape. Focus groups were conducted with thirteen care workers and six case managers from one Australian aged care organisation. The data revealed valuable information about the: daily activities of <b>front</b> <b>line</b> staff; information exchange mechanisms facilitating <b>front</b> <b>line</b> work; management of clients and client relationships; and implications of policy and organisational changes on <b>front</b> <b>line</b> work and clients. <b>Front</b> <b>line</b> staff highlighted the importance of care coordination, communication and continuity of care delivery, all of which impact on client relationships and quality of care. For aged care organisations and policy makers, the findings identify important areas for consideration when making decisions about changes to community care, including the key role of <b>front</b> <b>line</b> staff in fostering client relationships, providing consistency and continuity, balancing the needs and expectations of clients, and providing support and advocacy of care options...|$|R
