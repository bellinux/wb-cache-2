When Sam Warner decided to make The Jazz Singer a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed to put it over. He told Jessel {{that he would have}} to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> and often said that Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.|$|E

So I’m relieved." [...] Knapp described her character as a tomboy, and was given the opportunity to add to the role, move beyond a [...] "hot chick" [...] archetype.|$|E
500|$|Out of {{fear that}} Michael Scott (Steve Carell) will tell the others he has {{feelings}} for Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) allows Michael {{to believe that they}} are good friends, which leads to an awkward lunch at Hooters paid for with a corporate credit card. Michael ultimately reveals Jim's secret to everyone, forcing Jim to confess his crush to Pam himself, although he tells her that he <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> three years ago. However, Michael later tells her that he learned of the crush during the [...] "booze cruise" [...] which occurred recently, leading her to suspect that Jim is still infatuated.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato along with the Jonas Brothers, who {{produced}} it with John Fields. The song features Dorian Crozier and Michael Bland on drums, and Fields on bass, guitars and keyboards. Nick Jonas also played the guitar and percussion on the song. The song is registered as [...] "Did You Forget" [...] with the Broadcast Music, Inc. Lovato has stated that [...] "Don't Forget" [...] {{is one of the}} songs on Don't Forget that she relates to the most, and that she felt [...] "a lot of emotion while recording it". In an interview with PopEater, she elaborated, [...] "Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love, but then the other person just walks away, and goes somewhere else. I went through an experience like that and wanted to write about it. I <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> and now a year later I don't have those feelings about that person anymore." [...] The song and [...] "La La Land" [...] were included as bonus tracks on European editions of her sophomore album Here We Go Again.|$|E
500|$|Universal reissued Graffiti in 1978 {{and earned}} an {{additional}} $63 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ), which brought the total {{revenue for the}} two releases to $118 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). The reissue included stereophonic sound, and the additional four minutes that the studio had removed from Lucas's original cut. All home video releases also included these scenes. Also, the date of John Milner's death was changed from June 1964 to December 1964 to fit the narrative structure of the upcoming sequel More American Graffiti. At {{the end of its}} theatrical run, American Graffiti had one of the greatest cost-to-profit ratios of a motion picture ever. Producer Francis Ford Coppola regretted having not financed the film himself. Lucas recalled, [...] "He would have made $30 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) on the deal. He never <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> and he still kicks himself." [...] It was the 13th-highest-grossing film of all time in 1977, and, adjusted for inflation, is currently the 43rd highest. By the 1990s, American Graffiti had earned more than $200 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in box office gross and home video sales. In December 1997 Variety reported that the film had earned an additional $55.13 million in rental revenue (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|It {{was really}} cool when hip-hop started, you would hear {{references}} in lyrics, you always felt honored.

We were talking {{for a while and}} that whole thing with Greg [...] went down and everything kind of fell apart. Our relationship, which was the only truly solid relationship in the group, although Matt [...] and I are still great, Ryan [...] and I still briefly talk. I mean, the only way I personally would want to do Mudvayne is if everybody licked their wounds and <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> There's {{a lot of things in}} that band that tore us apart. Maybe Mudvayne was the martyr for people that stopped supporting music. You sell 159,000 records the first week, and then the next record is like, 'Whatever, f--k it.' Maybe it's a subliminal message if you don't support things... Mudvayne's probably bigger now than it ever was. So, people want what they can't have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Report of a sad case {{recently}} {{tried before}} the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley. Lord Mayor asks whether either side {{is known to}} the police: Policeman X— Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say {{that the old man}} never <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it,</b> and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't {{think it will be a}} harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street. (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode on Melancholy" [...] were {{inspired}} by sonnet forms and probably written after [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Keats's new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued Endymion, which Keats dedicated to Thomas Chatterton, a work that he termed [...] "a trial of my Powers of Imagination". It was damned by the critics, giving rise to Byron's quip that Keats was ultimately [...] "snuffed out by an article", suggesting that he never truly <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>it.</b> A particularly harsh review by John Wilson Croker appeared in the April 1818 edition of The Quarterly Review. John Gibson Lockhart writing in Blackwood's Magazine, described Endymion as [...] "imperturbable drivelling idiocy". With biting sarcasm, Lockhart advised, [...] "It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to plasters, pills, and ointment boxes". It was Lockhart at Blackwoods who coined the defamatory term [...] "the Cockney School" [...] for Hunt and his circle, which included both Hazlitt and Keats. The dismissal was as much political as literary, aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education, non-formal rhyming and [...] "low diction".
